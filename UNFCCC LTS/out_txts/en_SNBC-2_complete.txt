The National Low Carbon Strategy (SNBC for Stratégie Nationale Bas-Carbone) describes a road
map for France on how to steer its climate change mitigation policy. It provides guidelines to
enable the transition to a low carbon economy in all sectors of activity.
It sets out objectives for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in France in the short/medium term -
carbon budgets1 - and has two ambitions: to achieve carbon neutrality, i.e. zero net emissions2, by
2050 (an objective introduced by the July 2017 climate plan and enshrined in law), and to reduce
the carbon footprint of the French people.
The National Low Carbon Strategy is one of two components of French climate policy, it works
alongside the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan that focuses on French adaptation policy3.
The strategy and carbon budgets are legally binding for the public sector, mainly through a
requirement to take them into account4. Thus although the strategic objectives of this document
are binding for all companies and citizens, they are nevertheless addressed as a priority to public
decision-makers, particularly at national, regional and intermunicipal level, including public
establishments, on the mainland and for the overseas territories to which the Strategy applies:
Guadeloupe, French Guyana, Martinique, Reunion, Mayotte, Clipperton Island, Saint-Martin and
Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon (cf. appendix 1: Legislative and regulatory context). The following are
specifically required to take the National Low Carbon Strategy into account:
 Planning documents and programming that have significant impact on greenhouse gas
emissions (sectoral policy documents and regional plans)
 Since 10 October 2017, financing decisions for public projects, taken by public or private
individuals. They should take into account, among other criteria, the impact of the project in
terms of greenhouse gas emissions5.
 In the energy sector, this legal requirement is stricter for the metropolitan Multi-Annual
Energy Plan (PPE), which should be compatible with the National Low Carbon Strategy
and the carbon budgets6.
Every five years, the low carbon strategy is subject to a complete revision (cf. chapter 5. Strategy
revision and monitoring). Between each revision, the monitoring is based on a set of regularly
analysed and updated indicators (cf. appendix 2). Indicators of the strategy) as well as a regular
review of whether its principles are being taken into account in the public policies.
This strategy, written in close cooperation with stakeholders and with public participation (cf.
chapter 2.4.) and taking into account the opinions of the formal consultations carried out before
adoption (in particular the Environmental Authority and the High Council for Climate), is adopted by
the Government (decree N°TRER2008021D relating to national carbon budgets and the national
low-carbon strategy, section 1 of chapter II of title II of book II of the French Environmental Code).
1 Emissions caps not to be exceeded per period of five years.
2 So a balance between greenhouse gas emissions and carbon absorption by ecosystems managed by man (forests, agricultural
soils, etc.) and industrial processes (carbon capture and storage or reuse) on a national scale, without recourse to offsetting by
international credits.
3 These two policies interact through the use of positive synergies (for example in the forestry domain) and through resolving
contradictions between the measures planned (for example in the building sector on accounting for comfort in the summer).
4 The requirement to take the strategy into account entails “not straying from the fundamental principles except, under the
supervision of the judge, on the grounds of the value of the operation and under the condition that this value is justified” (EC, 9
June 2004, 28 July 2004 and 17 March 2010). The main result is that the SNBC cannot be ignored and any deviations should be
explicit and reasoned.
5 Article L. 222-1 B.III of the French Environment Code created by act no. 2015-992 of 17 August 2015 relating to the energy
transition for green growth.
6 Compatibility involves an obligation of non-conflict with the fundamental principles, while leaving room for manoeuvre to further
define and develop these strategies.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 4/176CHAPTER 1: CONTEXT AND KEY ISSUES
1.1. France aims to make an ambitious and fair contribution to
combating climate change
The present strategy aims for carbon neutrality across French territory by 2050. This ambitious
target is fully in line with France’s long-standing commitment to fighting climate change. At the end
of the 1970s, the international community became aware of the need for global cooperation:
 At the first Earth summit in 1992, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change was opened for signatures in order to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of
greenhouse gases to a level that would prevent any human perturbation harming the
climate system.
 The Kyoto protocol was adopted in 1997 and came into effect in 2005. It committed
industrialised countries to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions by 5% between 1990
and 2012.
 Following the IPCC’s fourth assessment report, the countries met in Copenhagen in 2009
to set a goal of limiting average global temperature rises to +2°C, which involves halving
global emissions by 2050. In 2007, the IPCC estimated that this goal would require
reductions of 80-95% by 2050 in developed countries.
In this context, France acted as far back as 2000 by introducing climate policies to reduce
emissions, such as the National Climate Change Action Plan (2000) and the successive Climate
Plans. In particular, the 2004-2012 Climate Plan, launched in 2004, aimed to reduce these
emissions by a factor of 4 by 2050 (Factor 4), in line with IPCC recommendations. A growing
political awareness in the 2000s could be observed, notably with a speech by Jacques Chirac at
the Earth summit in 2002 - “Our house is burning and we are looking elsewhere” - and during the
Grenelle Environment Forum in 2007. The national debate on energy transition followed in 2013
as well as the energy transition for green growth act in 2015.
In December 2015, the adoption of the Paris Agreement marked a turning point. It introduced a
sustainable and ambitious international framework for cooperation on climate change. In particular,
the Agreement:
 now aims to limit global warming "well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing
efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C", and to achieve a global balance between
greenhouse gas emissions and absorption - "carbon neutrality" - in the second half of the
21st century;
 Recognizes the principles of “equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and
respective capabilities in the light of different national circumstances.” This requires the
countries that have contributed the most to climate change (due to their past and current
greenhouse gas emissions) and that are in a position to do so (capacity and potential to
reduce emissions) to play a more active role in global climate action.
Consequently, by boosting its ambition and now aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050, France
contributes to effectively implementing the Paris Agreement in terms of respecting the climate
justice principle7.
1.2. Looking back: progress made so far.
A.Historic emissions in the country
Among the developed countries, France is one of the least carbonised countries: emissions per
7 In the sense of inequality reduction as defined by the Economic, Social and Environmental Opinion published in September 2016.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 5/176unit of GDP in France are among the lowest in the world, which could already be observed back in
1990 (cf. the following graph).
CO  emissions per unit of GDP

This can be explained in particular by the effective policies to reduce energy consumption and the
development of nuclear energy, initiated following the first oil shock of 1973 in order to limit
dependence on imported oil (creation of the French Agency for Energy Economy in 1974,
awareness campaign “chasse au gaspi” (chase the waste), nuclear electricity programme, etc.).

Source: SDES energy balance (data not adjusted for climate)
Although the major changes launched at the end of the 1970s and start of the 1980s later faltered
as a result of the decreasing price of hydrocarbons, known as the “oil counter shock”, the desire to
control energy consumption re-emerged at the end of the 1990s (General commissioner report of
the Energy Control Plan published in 1998) and was followed by the climate policies repeated in
the successive Climate Plans.
In terms of non-energy emissions, successive common agricultural policies from 1992 onwards led
to changes in agricultural practices with the increase in financial rewards for the positive
externalities of agriculture, particularly environmental concerns, which led to a drop in emissions
for the sector.
The results were:
 an economy that became one of the least carbon-reliant among all developed nations:
◦ In emissions per capita, France was the lowest emitter in the G78 in 2015 (EDGAR
data);
◦ In CO  emissions per unit of GDP, France was the lowest emitting country in the G7 in
2
2018 (cf. graph of GHG emissions per unit of GDP above).
 Public policies aiming to reduce emissions (mainly energy efficiency policies, but also those
promoting the use of carbon-free energies);
 An experience revealing that efficiency can be a limit to the “carbon price” signal and a
need for more structured, powerful and long-lasting emissions reduction policies;
 The development of renewable energies;
 Growing public awareness.
8  The G7 is made up of Canada, the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and France.

Source: UNFCCC-CITEPA, format UNFCCC/ CRF – Kyoto scope excluding LULUCF
After a period of stability between 1990 and 2005, these policies led to a reduction in emissions of
-1.4%/year on average between 2005 and 2017, that is -7.5 MtCO eq/year on average.
2
In 2017, France’s greenhouse gas emissions (within the scope of the Kyoto protocol) excluding the
land use, land use change and forestry sector (LULUCF),9 fell by 15.2% in comparison to 1990, in
a context where the population increased by 15.4%. French emissions per capita within the same
scope fell from 9.5 t CO eq to 6.9 t CO eq between 1990 and 2017, which is a reduction of over
2 2
26.6%, while GDP rose by 51.8% over the same period. During the same period, emissions
intensity per unit of GDP fell by 44.2%, thus demonstrating an uncoupling of emissions from
economic growth.
The sector that has contributed the most to reducing French emissions since 1990 is industry.
Although the 2008-2009 economic crisis and the resulting reduction in economic activity did play a
role, the majority of emissions reductions in this sector are due to improvements in the energy and
environmental efficiency of the processes. Thus, the chemistry sector has seen emissions fall by
59.8% in France between 1990 and 2017, due in particular to a drastic reduction in N O emissions
2
from the production of adipic and nitric acids and a reduction in energy intensity. An analysis of the
detailed progression of sectoral emissions from 1990 to 2016 can be found in part 3 of the
companion report to this strategy.
The transport sector is the primary greenhouse gas emitter in France. In 2017, it represented
29.9% of national emissions, or 139 Mt CO eq, rising sharply between 1990 and 2004 (+ 18.9%)
2
then falling by -7.9% between 2004 and 2009 before a slight increase of +2.0% between 2009 and
2016. This progression is due to the increase in road traffic. It has not been offset by the decrease
in unit emissions of new vehicles or the development of biofuels, whose strong progression since
2005 has nevertheless resulted in a significant decrease in road sector emissions.
9  The LULUCF sector is a reference inventory sector for anthropogenic emissions/absorption of greenhouse gases (GHGs)
resulting from changes in the carbon store in soils and forests.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 8/176B. Emissions from consumption by French people
Reducing territorial emissions is not the only objective of the national low carbon strategy. France
can and must also act to reduce its carbon footprint, i.e. the emissions linked to the consumption
of French people and not only the emissions produced on the national territory. The two concepts
are described and compared in appendix 4. Supplements to carbon footprint chapter.
The carbon footprint of French people has been estimated at 749 Mt CO eq in 2017. It
2
significantly increased, by 21.5%, between 1995 and 2011, and has been relatively stable
since then.
The emissions embedded in imports have been rising steadily since 1995, exceeding territorial
emissions excluding export from 2010 onwards (emissions from exports fluctuated only slightly
over the period).
Progression of the carbon footprint
The issue of controlling emissions from consumption is addressed in chapter 4.1.i. Carbon
footprint.
C. National emissions since the SNBC – compliance with first carbon budget
A first assessment of compliance with the first carbon budget was carried out in 2019 using the
national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions for the year 2018, based on the 2015-2017 results
and an estimation of emissions for 2018. This assessment shows that France is not compliant with
the first 2015-2018 carbon budget. The 2015-2018 carbon budget is provisionally estimated to
have been exceeded by +65 Mt CO eq over the whole period (+ 3.7%), or a mean excess of
2
approximately +16 Mt CO eq per year.10 The final balance of the 2015-2018 carbon budget will be
2
10  This estimate takes into account a first adjustment in 2018-2019 of the first three carbon budgets, downwards, to take into
account methodological developments in the accounting of emissions on inventories in 2019. (cf. methodology described in
chapter 3. The carbon budgets).  There will be a definitive adjustment if needed
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 9/176published in spring 2020, based on updated inventory data.
The discrepancies between the indicative annual budgets (provisionally adjusted in 2019) and
actual results are estimated at +4 MtCO eq for 2015, +14 MtCO eq for 2016, +28 Mt CO eq for
2 2 2
2017 and +19 Mt CO eq for 2018.

Sources: UNFCCC inventory, Kyoto format, submitted on 15 March 2019 and 29 June 2015, carbon budgets
adopted in 2015 and carbon budgets provisionally adjusted in 2019
The causes of this overshoot are analysed and are mainly of a structural nature.
Indeed, the estimated surplus of emissions linked to unfavourable cyclical factors, the two main
ones being low energy prices between 2015 and 2017 and the unavailability of part of the nuclear
power generation fleet between 2016 and 2018, is estimated to be almost offset by emission
reductions linked to other favourable cyclical factors, such as mild temperatures in 2015, 2017 and
2018.
This is due in particular to significantly worse than expected results in the transport and building
sectors (around +41 and +39 Mt CO eq respectively over the whole period) and agriculture
2
(around +8 Mt CO eq over the whole period). These poor results are partly offset by better than
2
first SNBC targets in the power generation sector11 despite the unavailability of part of the nuclear
fleet (about -25Mt CO eq over the whole period).
2
Apart from the low price of energy already mentioned, stagnation of emissions in the transport
sector can be explained in particular by a weak improvement in the performance of new vehicles,
an upturn in road traffic and worse results than hoped for in the modal shift in the goods sector.
In the building sector, the discrepancy is mainly down to the insufficient pace and extent of
renovations.
11  The cap for this sector, which includes electricity production, was set in 2015 conservatively awaiting arbitration on the electricity
mix.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 10/176D. Lessons to learn from the 1990-2017 progression for the current period to 2050
The excess could increase for the second carbon budget (2019-2023) adopted in 2015,
considering the inertia of the system, particularly in transport emissions that are spontaneously
growing faster than GDP. Effective action to reduce emissions in the short term is thus
indispensable to keep this excess as low as possible.
As for the long-term progression: the rate of decarbonisation should be increased to achieve
neutrality, going from -1.4 %/year (on average between 2005 and 2017) to - 6.0%/year on average
from 2019 to 2050.
This current strategy thus aims to increase the decarbonisation rate of the national economy and
to reduce imported emissions.
1.3. Presentation of the main levers to be pulled  and the
lessons   to   be   drawn   from   earlier   and   foreign   foresight
exercises.
The Climate Plan provided a new direction for national climate policies: carbon neutrality by 2050.
This objective is a response to France’s international commitments in the context of the Paris
Agreement.
There are several possible means to achieve carbon neutrality. However they all require profound
reforms in all sectors of the economy.
A.Main levers to be pulled
a) Physical levers influencing the transition
The route taken by a climate scenario can be defined by the degree to which the different levers
that influence the volume of greenhouse gas emissions are pulled.
There are three main levers for reducing emissions from energy consumption:
 Decarbonisation of energy vectors (such as replacing coal-based electricity production
with renewable electricity production)
 Energy efficiency,  which basically involves providing the same services using less
energy (such as replacing combustion vehicles with electric vehicles which use three
times less energy; or thermal insulation for buildings)
 Sobriety, which involves consuming with moderation (consuming less) goods and
services with high environmental impact (typically reducing indoor heating temperature).
For emissions not linked to energy consumption (fertilizers, ruminants, waste, industrial processes
etc.), in the same way as for energy, it is possible to break down the structuring factors of the
different greenhouse gas emissions pathways by distinguishing between:
  "carbon" efficiency (equivalent greenhouse gas emissions per unit produced) which can
vary greatly depending on the production methods (examples of low-carbon manufacturing
processes (i.e. with good carbon efficiency): low-carbon hydraulic binder for cement,
hydrogen reduction process applied to the iron and steel industry and chemistry...) ;
 Changes in modes of consumption (such as consuming agro-ecology products or the
increasing share of plant proteins in diets).
Finally, the last set to characterize a path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the carbon sink
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 11/176(capacity of the territory to store carbon in the forest, in soils, in wood products or via industrial
processes) and the land sector (which can store carbon but which can also release it, via land take
for example or via the conversion of permanent grasslands into ploughed land). The levers
corresponding to the natural carbon sink are fighting against land take, strengthening the carbon
stock of agricultural soils and improving forest management and bio-based channels. From a
climate point of view, forestry management should aim to both adapt forests to climate change and
optimize climate change mitigation by taking the best account possible of the short-, medium- and
long-term effects. This can be achieved by improving and strengthening the upstream "carbon
pump" (i.e. the capacity of forests to absorb carbon), increasing timber harvesting and maximising
storage and substitution effects downstream. Finally, carbon capture, use, and storage (CCUS)
technologies will be able to supplement the land sector's sink through anthropogenic carbon
capture and sequestration, depending on the available potential (cf. appendix 5.  “CCUS”).
To meet the ambitious aim of neutrality in 2050, every one of these levers should be pulled. In
particular, for the energy part, only near-total decarbonisation12 will allow us to attain zero net
emissions (cf. chapter 2.2. “The baseline scenario”); in particular the transport, building and non-
specific industrial sectors should all be aiming for zero direct emissions.
Carbon neutrality requires not only even greater emission reductions than for Factor 4, but also,
potentially, the generation of negative emissions by combining biomass combustion with carbon
capture and storage (BECCS) facilities13. These will make it easier to attain carbon neutrality by
offsetting emissions in the sectors where carbon-free alternatives do not exist, or come at a very
high cost. Regarding their storage potential (including offshore), these technologies will be
deployed in a way that is as integrated as much as possible through the reuse of existing
infrastructure. The uncertainties surrounding these technologies - as to the availability and
reliability of their storage potential and their acceptability - means these technologies should
however be developed with caution and incrementally. That said, BECCS remains the only lever
(alongside direct CO  capture from the atmosphere, but it is at a very early stage of development)
2
that may allow us to generate negative emissions in the very long term (the forest storage
eventually attaining an equilibrium in the very long term).
b) Public policy instruments
Public policies have a central role to play in meeting the carbon budgets and targets set at
European level for 2020 and 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Several instruments
exist, which are often complementary. These include taxation, regulation, standards, subsidies
(such as supporting innovation and the use of low carbon technologies), European quotas and
markets, supporting actors and channels, training, raising awareness among citizens, informing
consumers, etc.
It is important to select instruments in line with the desired effect and the economic and social
context, taking into account the vulnerability of households, territories and sectors of activity, with a
view to a just transition. A varied mix of instruments will allow us to respond to the different
situations.
12 Decarbonisation can only be "near-total" given the need for fossil fuels in domestic air transport and the "incompressible" residual
leakages of renewable gases.
13 This solution is said to generate "negative" emissions because the biomass energy associated with carbon capture and storage
allows carbon that has previously been removed from the atmosphere through photosynthesis to be stored underground.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 12/176B. International scenarios and strategies
a) The Paris Agreement objectives
The COP21 decided to invite the Parties to the Climate Convention to publish their long-term low
emission development strategies by 2020. Several countries including France (with the SNBC-
2015) responded and submitted their plans in 2016 (United States, Canada, Mexico, Germany and
Benin). The revised version of the SNBC will be presented at the Climate Convention in this
context.  Many other countries have also started the process of drafting and revising their
strategies or have adopted similar legislations.
b) The European framework
In 2011, the Commission published a roadmap to 2050, which aimed to reduce emissions by
somewhere between 80% and 95% in 2050 in comparison to 1990. It also assessed the impacts
of this reduction. This document played a central role in setting the EU’s 2030 goals in 2014.
In response to the invitation of the Climate Convention, and to adapt this document to a context
that has changed considerably since 2011 (adoption of the Paris Agreement, reduction in the price
of renewable energies, adoption of the European energy-climate package, etc.), the European
Union plans to communicate its own strategy in 2020. In preparation for this work, the European
Commission published a communication in 2018 entitled "A Clean Planet for All", presenting its
long-term strategic vision for a carbon-neutral economy by 2050. The European Council of 12
December 2019 adopted the climate neutrality objective for the EU in 2050, making Europe the
first continent to adopt this objective, which should be transcribed into European law. The
European Commission will also present an impact assessment in the summer of 2020 on how to
raise the EU's climate ambition to reach an emissions reduction target of -50% or even -55% in
2030 compared to 1990. In addition, the regulation on the governance of the energy union,
adopted in 2018, also requires EU member states to submit long-term integrated national energy-
climate plans as part of the European reporting system. The national low-carbon strategy as well
as mainland France’s Multi-Annual Energy Plan feed into this national plan, which is now
published on the European Commission website14.
c) The international scenarios and strategies
Long-term objectives have proven to be valuable under the condition that they are able to inform
short-term decisions. To make this link, some countries have chosen to enshrine these objectives
into their laws (France, United Kingdom, Sweden), or set their five-year carbon budgets to shorter
time frames (France, United Kingdom). A system that divides the overall objective into sectorial
targets (France, Germany, Canada) has also been proven to encourage all of the sectors of the
economy to contribute to their full respective abatement potentials. Finally, many countries are
planning to establish a group of independent experts who, following the example of the British
Climate Change Committee, can provide recommendations to the government on the compliance,
monitoring and implementation of their climate strategies. In France, the High Council for the
Climate has been playing a similar role since 2019, providing advice on:
1° Carbon budget and low-carbon strategy projects;
2° Compliance with the carbon budgets already set and the implementation of the low-
carbon strategy in progress at the national and territorial levels.
The level of detail in describing the transformations required to meet the target varies for the
different strategies, notably depending on the modelling capabilities available to the public
authorities, as well as for the approach underpinning the strategy (more operational or more
strategic etc.).
14 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/topics/energy-strategy/national-energy-climate-plans_en
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 13/176The majority of strategies were conceived in consultation with the stakeholders, whose modes of
participation vary greatly from one country to another. Those who did consult stakeholders agree
that it was useful both to benefit from their expertise and to ensure that they took ownership of the
strategy. On the other hand, public consultation is a more difficult exercise that has not been
systematically undertaken due to lack of means and expertise.
France is known for its climate action: its SNBC-2015 was classed as the best among all the
European strategies by the MaxiMiser (WWF) study, and its Climate Plan published in July 2017
set ambitious new sectorial objectives for the short and long term. Studying other countries’
climate strategies however shows that France is not alone, and that a certain number of countries,
including some large emitters, have set similar objectives. For example, some fifteen countries,
including Brazil, New Zealand, Mexico and the Marshall Islands, have also committed to achieving
carbon neutrality, and the United Kingdom, India, China, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands
have also declared themselves in favour of ending the sale of vehicles that emit greenhouse gases
(announced for 2040 in France in the July 2017 climate plan, this objective having been included
in the mobility guidance law).
C. National foresight exercises: varied strategies with different paradigms.
At national level, numerous energy foresight exercises have been undertaken with some very
different paradigms. They have been carried out by various stakeholders: think tanks, NGOs,
public institutions, network managers, company associations, etc.
In 2013, a National Debate on Energy Transition was organised. It highlighted the wide diversity of
national scenarios that would allow us to achieve Factor 4.
More recently, scenarios covering the whole economy by 2050 have been updated. This is the
case in particular for Ademe’s Visions and the negaWatt scenario (including the Afterres element).
In the context of the SNBC in particular, two contrasting scenarios have been established.
Other forecasting exercises have also fed into the work of the SNBC. Network operators in
particular publish their provisional balance sheets every year. RTE's scenarios for electricity and
GRTgaz and GrDF's scenarios for gas forecast demand and supply trends up to 2035.
The national scenarios surveyed contained varied aims, including forecasting exercises, projection
in a different future or prospective exercises. These diverse visions in the different countries can
be read and compared through the levels of mobilisation of each actionable lever: sobriety, energy
efficiency, energy source, technologies used etc. and through the public policy instruments in
operation.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 14/176CHAPTER 2: FRANCE'S PROJECT
France has set targets for reducing territorial greenhouse gas emissions, in line with its
international commitments15 and EU policy. These are:
 Achieving carbon neutrality by 205016
 40% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 199017;
 In the short and medium terms, comply with the carbon budgets adopted by decree,
meaning the emissions caps should not be exceeded per period of five years.
In parallel to the reduction of territorial emissions, the national low carbon strategy aims to achieve
an overall reduction in the French carbon footprint (cf. chapter 4.1.i. “Carbon footprint”).
We must develop a new sustainable model of growth that creates jobs and wealth and improves
wellbeing whilst building a circular economy for the future that is resilient to climate change.
2.1. Strategic Themes
A.Ambition
Achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 is a real challenge (reducing gross emissions by a factor of at
least 6) requiring very ambitious efforts in terms of energy efficiency, ambitious also in terms of
sobriety, involving massive investments and a substantial transformation of our production and
consumption patterns in order to develop a more circular economy, which is both resource-efficient
and less waste-producing.
These climate issues are global and closely linked to our consumption. Thus, it is also our
responsibility to control the emissions embedded in the goods and services imported to France.
B.International equity
France assumes its responsibility in the fight against climate change, and upholds the principle
already approved at international level of an action that is proportionate to the common
responsibilities of States, but is fair and thus differentiated depending on the countries, taking into
account the differences in the national situations, notably in terms of their capacity and potential to
reduce emissions and their historical responsibility.
C.Realism
The strategy is based on a prospective baseline scenario of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050
(cf. chapter 2.2. “The baseline scenario”). This will allow us to define one credible vision for the
transition to carbon neutrality. It is based on the use of mainly existing technologies and, to a
limited and reasonable extent, highly innovative technologies. It considers ambitious but realistic
decarbonisation potentials of the different sectors of the economy.
D.Diversity of technological and behavioural options
The aim is to mobilise a wide variety of green economy levers and in particular: energy efficiency
and sobriety in all sectors, decarbonisation of energy sectors (almost total abandonment of fossil
fuels), reduction of non-energy emissions (livestock farming, industrial processes, etc.) and the
strengthening of carbon sinks and bio-based production. This should lead to both:
15 In the context of the Paris Agreement and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.
16 As announced in the climate plan presented in July 2017 and enshrined in the law of 8 November 2019 on energy and climate
(notably without recourse to offsetting by international credits).
17 Goal of the energy transition for green growth act passed in 2015.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 15/176 considerable spreading of the most advanced low carbon technologies, thus permitting a
transition at the lowest possible cost, while preparing for the future by encouraging
innovation and the development of technologies still in less advanced stages, and
anticipating an inertia in some sectors (the sometimes very long lifespan of equipment and
infrastructure could create lock-in situations in high greenhouse gas emitting systems),
 a large-scale social change in favour of the climate and energy transition, notably through
the promotion of more moderate lifestyles and consumption patterns and a clear
reinforcement of the logic of circular economy and waste reduction, also including a
change in the skills of companies and territories through vocational training.
E. Supporting the transition, wealth creation and sustainable employment
The strategy promotes a reduction in our carbon footprint (including with measures to combat
carbon leakage), a better resilience in our economy and an almost completely carbon-free energy
system18 to return the country to energy independence. It is thus favourable for the economy and
will create jobs that cannot be relocated.
Measures to combat carbon leakage may include, in particular, the introduction of pricing at
Europe's borders (carbon inclusion mechanism) compatible with the rules of the World Trade
Organisation, and strengthening the cross-cutting mainstreaming of sustainable development
issues in trade agreements, in particular by making the ratification of and compliance with the
Paris Agreement an essential clause in future European Union trade agreements.
The strategy encourages investment in R&D&I to ensure France is better positioned in the new
green channels and the markets of the future.
The decarbonisation of our economy also requires a better organisation of our territories into "local
multi-use living areas", with jobs better distributed in the territories, better promoting agriculture,
forestry, bio-based, reuse, repair and recycling sectors.
The SNBC’s underlying scenario was subject to a macro-economic assessment. The macro-
economic impact of the transition appears reasonable and has little negative effect on the GDP
trajectory in general economic terms. The transition will lead to a shift in investments and jobs
towards certain sectors that benefit from the energy transition (especially the building sector due to
investments in energy renovations).
The energy transition will have a long-term benefit of reducing household utility bills, since the
improvements in energy performance are expected to gain ground over the rise in energy prices.
Nevertheless, the energy transition requires significant investments  (building  renovations,
purchase of clean vehicles, etc.). If these investments are profitable in the long term, households
will need support during the transition period, via the various existing and future public aids,
particularly those targeting the most modest households.  
F. Health and environment co-benefits
A strategic environmental assessment of the SNBC revealed some incidences of likely positive
effects on the following environmental stakes (cf. details annexed to the report accompanying this
strategy):
 Limiting greenhouse gas emissions
 Strengthening local resilience to climate change and limiting natural risks
 Preserving soil and water quality
 Limiting depletion of mineral resources and developing the circular economy.
18 Decarbonisation can only be "near-total" given the need for fossil fuels in domestic air transport and the "incompressible" residual
leakages of renewable gases.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 16/176It also raises some points of attention, in particular relating to:
 Preserving soil and water quality, preserving biodiversity and the loss of natural, agricultural
and forest spaces
 Managing non-energy mineral resources
 Air quality.
2.2. The baseline scenario
The National Low Carbon Strategy is based on a baseline scenario developed through a modelling
exercise also used in France’s Multi-Annual Energy Plan. This scenario, called “With Additional
Measures” (Avec Mesures Supplémentaires: AMS), details the public policy measures, in addition
to those already in place, which will allow France to meet its short-, medium- and long-term
climate and energy objectives. It outlines a possible trajectory for reducing greenhouse gas
emissions until carbon neutrality is achieved by 2050, which is used as the basis for defining the
carbon budgets. Other trajectories would also be possible to reach this goal. This trajectory is
different in that it is has been built through an iterative process with the stakeholders of France’s
PPE (Multi-Annual Energy Plan) and the SNBC. A summary of the assumptions made under this
scenario is available online on the website of the Ministry for ecological transition19.
In order to construct this scenario, a reflection centred on a carbon-neutral France was first carried
out. This allowed different routes to be explored and identified some requisite steps in order to
meet the country’s climate and energy goals in each of the sectors.
A.Scope of AMS scenario
The AMS scenario is not prescriptive, only indicative. It does not constitute a long-term action plan,
instead it serves as a reference for the definition of the carbon budgets in particular. It also
provides elements for monitoring and steering the energy transition.
It is a long-term scenario since it deals with energy and climate issues by 2050. In the short term,
it describes the possible transformations in the various sectors taking into account the current
public policy measures as well as the constraints on the development of low-carbon technologies
and the international macroeconomic context.
B.Scenario philosophy
The AMS scenario aims to be ambitious in its goals but reasonable in its approach to meeting
them. It aims to achieve carbon neutrality without using offsetting through carbon credits in 2050. It
takes international transport into account20.
It does not envisage a breakaway from the demographic and macro-economic patterns officially
considered today (INSEE, European Commission). In fact, it puts forward the hypothesis that the
overseas territories will catch up economically with the mainland.
It mobilises all the levers to eliminate, in each sector, greenhouse gas emissions or, failing that, to
reduce them very sharply (including in the non-energy sectors). For 2050, a certain amount of
emissions appear to be incompressible, particularly in the non-energy sectors (especially
agriculture). These emissions should be offset by carbon sinks. The estimated sink from the
optimised and sustainable land sector (forest and agricultural land), added to a reasonable
technological capture and storage sink, balances only these residual non-energy and, to a lesser
19 https://www.ecologique-solidaire.gouv.fr/scenarios-prospectifs-energie-climat-air
20 Even if these are not counted in the country’s emissions in the sense of international accounting (therefore they do not count for
carbon neutrality, and are outside the scope of carbon budgets), it is nevertheless essential to include them in the scenario given
the energy resources to be provided for air and maritime transport.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 17/176extent, energy (e.g. domestic aviation) emissions.
Progression of net GHG emissions in the AMS scenario
Greenhouse gas sinks and emissions in the AMS scenario in 2050
To achieve this, the scenario relies on a reasoned use of sobriety levers, with the needs of the
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 18/176population decreasing slightly21  in all sectors, alongside a significant change in patterns of
consumption, without any loss of comfort. Energy efficiency is also being developed methodically
to make best use of the technologies we have today. This will lead to a sharp decrease in energy
consumption for all sectors together.
In the long term, it is not based on major technological gambles, while making realistic use of a
number of new technologies (carbon capture and storage, industrial processes, etc.).
Imported emissions (international transport and above all imports of goods and services) will also
be significantly reduced.
The scenario takes an approach that aims to be realistic and adaptable over time. It identifies the
conditions necessary for fulfilling and the optimally enhancing this effort economically. In the short
term, it incorporates the sectorial policies introduced until July 2017. These will be extended and
completed in order to expand the base affected and the intensity of the measures. Over time,
measures that deviate more substantially from current trends will be enacted.
C.Synthesis of the scenario by sector
The main approaches and measures included in the baseline scenario are described below by
sector.
a) Transport
The objective of neutrality by 2050 implies a near-total decarbonisation of the transport sector by
switching to electric motors, biofuel and biogas depending on the mode of transport. A share of
non-bio-based fuels is however reserved in 2050 for air transport and international marine
bunkers.
The scenario assumes that demand for mobility will grow but will be uncoupled from economic
growth compared to the current trend. It also includes strong assumptions in terms of engine
efficiency and type. The scenario mobilizes all of the following five levers: decarbonisation of the
energy consumed by vehicles; energy performance of vehicles in order to limit energy
consumption; control of demand growth, in particular by strengthening the circular economy;
modal shift; and optimising the use of vehicles for both passenger and freight transport.
Electrification is approximately two to three times more efficient than thermal solutions in terms of
fuel efficiency for vehicles. This option is prioritised in the long term, particularly for cars (100% of
sales for new cars will be electric after 2040). This option should be developed ambitiously since it
requires a five-fold multiplication of electric vehicle sales by 2022 (corresponding to the
commitment in the Contrat stratégique de la filière Automobile 2018-2022, Strategic Contract for
the Automobile sector 2018-2022). In 2030, the scenario attains a 35% share for private electric
cars and a 10% share for private rechargeable hybrid cars in sales of new vehicles. Significant
efforts should also be made in terms of vehicle efficiency, particularly for thermal vehicles. In
particular, the scenario targets a level of 4L/100km in real consumption for new vehicles sold in
2030. New electric vehicles should reach a performance level of 12.5 kWh/100 km by 2050 (about
40% less consumption in comparison to current levels).
A more balanced mix (renewable gas, electricity, biofuels) is sought for goods transport because of
the greater constraints in the engines used in this type of transport. Electrification for these
vehicles will be slower than for cars. Significant efforts in energy efficiency will also be made for
heavy goods vehicles: depending on the type of engine, improvements in efficiency of 35-40% will
be obtained by 2050.
The improvements in energy efficiency and decarbonisation will concern all modes of transport.
The scenario notably envisages a progressive development of biofuels in aviation to reach 50% by
21 Where appropriate by comparison with the “course of time” scenarios.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 19/1762050. Sea and river transport will be entirely carbon-free for domestic emissions by 2050 and 50%
decarbonised for the international bunkers.
The scenario assumes that the rise in traffic both for the transport of people and for the transport
of goods will be controlled, that a modal shift will occur towards active means of transport, public
transport and bulk transportation and that vehicle use will be optimised.
Passenger traffic in passenger-km for all modes together will rise by 26% between 2015 and 2050
but at a more moderate rate than in the business-as-usual scenario, notably because of the
increase in teleworking and a limitation of urban sprawl. The modal share of cycling will be
multiplied by 4 after 2030. Public transport will develop significantly with a progression in its modal
share of 7 points, this will also apply to shared transport and car-sharing. In total, this will allow a
limitation of private car traffic which will decrease by around 2% between 2015 and 2050.
Goods traffic in tonnes-km will grow by 40%, but at a lower rate than in the business-as-usual
scenario because of the development of a circular economy and local supply circuits. Rail and
river freight will develop. The loading rates of heavy goods vehicles will increase. The growth of
heavy goods traffic will be contained to 12% by 2050.

Transport sector emissions in the AMS
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 20/176b) Building sector
For this sector, the scenario assumes that the environmental regulation for new builds will be
progressively tightened, particularly through the introduction of a greenhouse gas emissions
criterion for the whole life cycle of the building. Demographic assumptions lead us to consider that
the volume of new buildings will continue to fall until 2050.
The scenario also assumes that a large majority of the building stock, starting with the least
energy-efficient homes, will be renovated in order to achieve the goal of 100% BBC (Bâtiments
Basse Consommation/ Low Consumption Buildings) on average in 2050. In the residential sector,
the rate of renovation will reach around 370,000 equivalent complete renovations22 on average for
the 2015-2030 period and then rise to 700,000 equivalent complete renovations on average over
the 2030-2050 period. The tertiary sector will also undergo a similar rate of renovation.
The energy mix will be totally carbon free by 2050. This relies on electrifying all uses apart from
heating and a more varied energy mix for this latter use, with particularly significant recourse to
heat pumps and urban heat networks. Efficiency gains for all equipment used in the buildings are
taken into account.
The scenario also calls for a reduction in energy needs in some areas through the spread of
technologies (intelligent management systems, efficient mixing valves, etc.), a more efficient
organisation of buildings (bioclimatic design, etc.) and proper individual behaviour (heating
temperature reduced by an average of 1°C by 2050).
Final energy consumption for buildings in the AMS
22 The energy improvements realised through an equivalent complete renovation correspond to the improvements realised through a
high performance renovation of the whole building. The scenario does not include an estimate of the share between renovation in
stages and renovation in one go.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 21/176Building sector emissions in the AMS
c) Agriculture
In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the scenario assumes all the technical levers will be
used to their maximum potential (pulse crops, optimising the nitrogen cycle, reducing excess
proteins in animal rations, plowing practices, etc.), that agricultural systems will evolve (towards
agroforestry, agro-ecology, organic agriculture, grass-fed livestock and limited land take), that
domestic demand will be modified (in line with nutritional indicators for 2035, decrease in food
waste) and that production of energy and bio-based materials in agricultural systems will increase.
In terms of energy consumption, increased energy efficiency and controlled energy needs will
allow us to reach the goal of halving consumption by 2050. A significant level of electrification will
occur through the use of heat pumps and electric tractors, as soon as this becomes possible.
The agriculture sector will play an important role in producing bio-based energy resources,
particularly by making use of waste products. Nearly two thirds of the biomass used by 2050 will
come directly or indirectly from the agricultural sector.
Final energy consumption for agriculture in the AMS
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 22/176Agriculture sector greenhouse gas emissions in the AMS
d)      Forest/land sector
Forests contribute to the scenario as carbon sinks, as producers of bio-based materials that
substitute for high emitting materials and as producers of biomass (wood energy, by-products from
wood transformation industries and wood waste). Intelligent and sustainable forest management
will allow us to preserve the carbon pump effect while improving its resilience to climate risks and
better conserving biodiversity. The forest area will increase through afforestation. Harvests will
grow progressively from 48 Mm³ in 2015 to 65 Mm³ in 2030 and 83 Mm³ in 2050, which will require
significant efforts to reverse current trends, notably in private forests. Using wood from forest land
as a building material is highly recommended in comparison to using it for energy purposes. The
production of wood products with long lifespans (particularly for use in construction) will triple
between 2015 and 2050, which will increase the carbon sink of wood products. Downstream,
better collection of wood products at the end of their lifespan will allow us to increase the
production of this type of biomass. Finally, the sink in the forest/wood sector will be maintained
despite the current decrease in the forest sink caused by an increase in harvests. This will be
achieved through the wood product sink and new forests.
The graph below shows the progression of the land sector sink as a whole, including forest lands
as well as other lands (crops, grassland, artificialised land, etc.). Forest management should
enable us to attain the goal of zero net land take in 2050 and if we account for the carbon stored in
agricultural lands, this net sink will rise  between 2030 and 2050, after little change between 2015
and 2030.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 23/176Past (solid line) and projection (dashed line) of the forest sink and land sector between
1990 and 2050
e) Industry/Waste
In the industrial sector, the scenario assumes that the processes will become more efficient and
electrified. The energy efficiency gains will vary depending on the channels. In 2030, the scenario
assumes gains of between 10% and 30%. In 2050, the gains will rise by between 20% and 40%.
The electrification rate will rise slightly between 2015 and 2030 (from 38% to 41%) then more
rapidly until 2050 to reach over 70% of final consumption at this point.
The development of the circular economy makes it possible to stabilise production levels of the
main raw materials with extensive use of eco-design and incorporation rates of recycled raw
materials that increase drastically to around 80% in 2050, particularly for steel, aluminium, paper,
plastics and glass, thus making production processes more efficient. Waste will be almost entirely
reused.
Non-energy emissions for the industrial sector will also decrease by using more materials with low
carbon impacts (low carbon cement, bio-based chemicals, carbon-free hydrogen, etc.). A more
systematic use of wood as a material should also reduce reliance on materials with a higher
carbon footprint.
Industry competitiveness will be retained as regards competition from regions of the world where
the climate requirements are less stringent, in order to maintain a level of production similar to
2015 and limit imports of materials with high carbon content. One variant with a rise in French
production was studied in order to assess the resulting energy and climate impacts (by considering
national emissions and the carbon footprint) and the macro-economic impacts of a higher
relocation of production to France.

Industrial sector emissions in the AMS
f) Energy production and carbon capture and storage
The energy sector will be virtually carbon free23. The energy mix in 2050 will be made up of
renewable and recovered heat (90 - 100TWh), biomass (400 - 450 TWh) and carbon-free
electricity (remaining balance of 600 - 650 TWh, of which a part will be used for conversions to
other final energy vectors: hydrogen, gas, etc.). In 2050, renewable gas production will amount to
between 195 and 295 TWh24. The share of gas used in the residential and tertiary sector will
decrease sharply.
Carbon capture and storage technologies (CCS) are also used, albeit prudently, in the baseline
scenario. In 2050, they will allow us to avoid around 6 MtCO /year in industry and to annually
2
achieve around 10 MtCO   of negative emissions with energy production installations using
2
biomass (BECCS for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage).
Emissions for the energy production sector in the AMS
23 Decarbonisation is only “near-total” given the residual “incompressible” leaks of renewable gases.
24 The upper end of the range corresponds to a conversion to gas of all non-electrified heavy goods vehicles and all non-electrified
heat consumption in buildings and the production of more electricity using gas. Then, the only remaining types of consumption will
be solid biomass in industry and biofuels in air transport. Hydrogen is included in these estimates.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 25/176g) Some lessons from the scenario
Near-total decarbonisation of energy production requires exclusive reliance on the following
energy sources: biomass resources (agricultural and wood product waste, wood energy etc.), heat
from the environment (geothermal, heat pumps etc.) and carbon-free electricity. Given the current
structure of the economy, which is very much directed towards liquid and gaseous fuels, there is a
definite strain on biomass resources, the production of which will have to take into account the
context of climate change and sustainability criteria. These resources have thus been allocated
with priority given to uses that have high added value but few possibilities for substitution. The
figure below gives the indicative breakdown of resource allocation in this scenario. In this figure,
the consumption of biomass resources is slightly higher than the production potential for these
resources. Further work on the SNBC will be carried out to adjust the scenario for this specific
point. This slight excess is not likely to significantly modify the modelling results and does not
mean that the trajectory cannot be achieved.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 26/176The pressure on biomass means that by 2050 gas consumption (100% renewable by this time) will
have to decrease and at the same time electricity consumption will have to increase despite the
sharp drop in energy consumption by then, as shown in the two graphs below. The first charts the
national gas consumption trajectory of each sector in the scenario’s low hypothesis case. The total
gas consumption in the high hypothesis case is also shown. The second graph shows national
electricity consumption excluding network losses.

b) Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by sector
The reductions in emissions by sector25 by 2050 are presented in the following table:

Thus, the virtually carbon-free sectors in 2050 in the AMS scenario (transport, building and energy
production) represent the largest reduction in emissions (over -95% compared to 2015 and -89%

below: emissions emitted in 2015, on one hand, and the projection of emissions in the business-as-usual “with existing measures”
scenario (AME scenario) to 2050, on the other hand.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 29/176compared to the business-as-usual scenario). Inversely, as a broad outline, the sectors in which it
is assumed that incompressible residual emissions will remain in 2050 based on current
knowledge (agriculture/forestry, industry and waste) will record smaller emissions reductions.
While the agriculture and forestry sector will record the smallest emissions decreases, the efforts
envisaged in the AMS scenario for this sector are no less ambitious than for the other sectors. The
hypotheses considered by 2050 in fact assume a very substantial change in French agricultural
practices compared to 2015, particularly:
 25% reduction of the dairy cattle (livestock),
 33% reduction of the cattle other than dairy (livestock),
 82% reduction of surplus nitrogen
 Maximised soil cover according to the principles of agro-ecology with in particular:
◦ 84% increase in intermediate nitrate-trap crops
◦ 60% increase in intermediate crops for energy purposes.
c)     Compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets
This trajectory allows the following targets in greenhouse gas emissions reduction to be met in
France at the 2030 and 2050 time frames (see also the analysis of compliance with the first three
carbon budgets in chapter 3 “The carbon budgets”):

2015 and the revised SNBC (excluding LULUCF)
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 30/176The baseline trajectory of the revised strategy takes into account the accumulated delay with
respect to the first carbon budget, which explains higher cumulative emissions between 2015 and
2035 than the cumulative emissions obtained from the baseline trajectory of the strategy adopted
in 2015. After 2035, the cumulative GHG emissions of the baseline trajectory of the revised
strategy will fall sustainably below those of the original strategy. In terms of non-accumulated GHG
emissions, the SNBC 2 reference trajectory catches up sustainably with the SNBC 1 reference
trajectory from 2032 onwards.
2.3. Limits to the scenario, potential shocks, areas of concern
The baseline scenario of the national low carbon strategy does not aim to predict the country’s
future, instead it represents a projection of a future that is possible, desirable (notably in climate
terms), and reasonable based on current knowledge. It is the fruit of a dialogue with the
stakeholders (aiming for a relative consensus). It shows that carbon neutrality is an achievable
goal. It identifies several pathways and some requisite steps and highlights certain “lock-in”
situations to be avoided (economic or technological deadlocks). It facilitates the debate about our
decisions in society and draws attention to the technological developments required. Finally it
identifies weak but determinant signals for the long-term stakes, such as changes in patterns of
consumption.
As a counterpoint to the hypotheses considered to establish this scenario, different shocks or
incremental changes may occur which could cause significant discrepancies with the desired
greenhouse gas emissions reduction trajectory, and in particular:
 economic   shocks:   unforeseen   changes   (in   either   direction)   in   prices   of   energy,
technologies, other resources, etc.;
 technological shocks: unforeseen developments in technical potentials (renewable electric
energies, use and transformation of biomass, carbon capture and storage, power to gas,
etc.), emergence of new technologies, etc.;
 social shocks: increased awareness of climate change or, inversely, refusal to accept the
associated constraints (behaviour change), acceptability of public policies, demography,
etc.;
 geopolitical shocks: acceleration of climate change (including modification of fishing
resources, etc.) causing tension, conflicts accentuating its consequences, etc.
The modelling exercise carried out does however have its limitations. Indeed, a single trajectory is
proposed, with a few variants. While it aims to be reasonable, it does not represent all the
discussions nor show all of the solutions that were studied during the process of drafting the
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 31/176scenario. Indeed, the developments assumed within the baseline scenario require profound
changes in behaviour. The sociological dimension of the scenario will need to be further developed
in future exercises in order to better understand to what extent and under what conditions these
changes can be adopted by citizens. Finally, the scenario is based on the gradual implementation
of increasingly ambitious public policies, not all of which are explicitly described. Reaching the
target trajectory will therefore require fine steering in order to adopt additional measures in the
event of insufficient results in certain sectors, which is the purpose of the climate governance
framework currently in place in France.
Revising the strategy every 5 years (cf. chapter 5.2. Revision of the strategy) will enable it to be
updated in light of the latest developments and the increasingly detailed analysis of any points
raising particular issues.
2.4. A strategy built through collaboration
This strategy, co-developed by all the departments of the ministries concerned26  under the
guidance of the Ministry for an Ecological and Inclusive Transition, is the result of broad
consultation with representatives of civil society (cf. appendix 3. A strategy resulting from collective
work, Addendum to chapter 2.4) and namely:
 With the stakeholders (businesses, NGOs, trade unions, consumer representatives, MPs,
local authorities), via iterative discussions with a Comité d’Information et d’Orientation
(CIO, Information and Steering Committee) and seven themed work groups.
 With the public, via a public consultation in November and December 2017 prior to revising
the national low carbon strategy and a public debate prior to the Multi-Annual Energy Plan
conducted from March to June 2018, where subjects linked to the climate were also
discussed.
This strategy takes into account the opinion of the Expert Committee for Energy Transition27 on the
implementation of the SNBC adopted in 2015 and compliance with the first carbon budget, as well
as the opinion of the High Council for Climate on the carbon budget projects and the low carbon
strategy (cf. appendix 3. A strategy resulting from collective work, Addendum to chapter 2.4).
The opinions issued following other formal consultations in 2019 on the draft strategy and its
Strategic Environmental Assessment by the Environmental Authority, the National Council for
Ecological Transition, the Assembly of Corsica, the Overseas Collectivities (opinions issued by the
territorial authorities of Martinique, Reunion and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon), the National Standards
Assessment Council and [the public] are also taken into account (cf. appendix 3. A strategy
resulting from a collective work, addendum to chapter 2.4), as well as the European Commission’s
opinion on the draft Integrated National Energy-Climate Plan, the latter being mainly composed of
the SNBC and the PPE.
The opinions issued by the Economic, Social and Environmental Council and the Higher Council
for Construction and Energy Efficiency were also considered.
26 In particular the ministries that signed the decree adopting the SNBC and carbon budgets, i.e. the ministries in charge of
Ecological and Inclusive Transition, Territorial Cohesion and Relations with Local and Regional Authorities, Economy and Finance,
Labour, National Education and Youth, Agriculture and Food, Action and Public Accounts, Education, Research and Innovation and
Overseas France.

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 32/176CHAPTER 3: THE CARBON BUDGETS
3.1 What is a carbon budget? What is it for?
Carbon budgets are greenhouse gas emissions caps that must not be exceeded at national level
over five-year periods. In the short term, they define the targeted trajectory for greenhouse gas
emissions reduction, in line with the baseline scenario and France’s European and international
commitments. They are divided into:
 large sectors (ETS emissions28, ESR emissions29, and, from 2019 onwards: negative
emissions linked to Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry)
 by large areas of activity (transport, residential-tertiary buildings, industry, agriculture,
energy production and waste)
 per greenhouse gas;
 and, indicatively, in annual instalments.
The carbon budgets correspond to the emissions recorded in mainland France, Guadeloupe,
French Guiana, Martinique, Réunion, Saint Martin and Mayotte, as well as emissions from
transport between these geographical areas. Emissions from international air and maritime links
are not included in these readings.
Comparing France’s emissions (based on the most recent inventories) to the carbon budget of the
period in question, including data broken down by sector, is a key performance indicator of the
implementation of the strategy. In particular, this comparison demonstrates the recent impact of
measures passed.
The first three carbon budgets were adopted by decree in 2015 at the same time as the first
National Low Carbon Strategy, and cover the 2015-201830, 2019-2023 and 2024-2028 periods
(Decree No. 2015-1491 of 18 November 201531). Every five years, a new carbon budget – the
third for the coming years – is defined during the revision of the strategy.
In the event of a change in the greenhouse gas emissions accounting methodology leading to a
correction of more than 1% of emissions for the reference years specified in the decree adopting
the SNBC and the carbon budgets, the carbon budgets32 are adjusted technically in order to
ensure the consistency of the methodology used to draw up the carbon budgets with the
methodology used to assess compliance, while maintaining the same sectoral reductions in
relative value compared to 2005 (see Art. D.222-1-B-II of the French Environmental Code
3.2. Technical adjustment of the first three carbon budgets
In accordance with Article D. 222-1-B II of the French Environmental Code, a provisional technical
adjustment of the carbon budgets was made in 2019 with respect to the CITEPA inventory of April
2019 in SECTEN format, in light of a change in the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions for
inventories. The carbon budgets adopted by decree in 2015 were thus provisionally adjusted as
shown in the following table33.
28 The EU ETS (Emissions Trading Scheme) is an emissions quota system set up by the European Union.
29 ESR (Effort Sharing Regulation) reflects the European Union’s ambitions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in sectors not
covered by the ETS.
30 Exceptionally, the first carbon budget covered a 4-year period to align with the timeline for a French presidential mandate.

3.3. 2015-2018 carbon budget balance
The provisional balance sheet for the first 2015-2018 carbon budget shows an estimated excess
of 65 Mt CO eq over the whole period, or a mean annual excess of around 16 Mt CO eq per year.
2 2
Indeed, emissions would have decreased by only -1.0% per year on average between 2015 and
2018, whereas the SNBC 2015 scenario projected a decrease in emissions of -2.2% per year on
average. The final balance of the 2015-2018 carbon budget will be published in spring 2020,
based on updated inventory data.
The discrepancies between the indicative annual budgets (provisionally adjusted in 2019) and
actual results are estimated at +3 MtCO eq for 2015, +14 MtCO eq for 2016, +28 Mt CO eq for
2 2 2
2017 and +19 Mt CO eq for 2018.

By sector, the discrepancies with the indicative 2015-2018 budgets (provisionally adjusted in 2019)
are estimated at:
34 Expressed in CO2 equivalent
35A further adjustment could be necessary in 2020 if the change in the accounting of greenhouse gas emissions leads to another
adjustment of over 1% in emissions for the years 1990, 2005, 2010 and 2013.

◦ Fluorinated gases: - 4 MtCO2eq (i.e. around - 4.8 %).
3.4. The next carbon budgets
The next two carbon budgets were adopted by decree in 2015, and technically adjusted in 201936
following changes in greenhouse gas emissions accounting (cf. chapter 3.1). The next budget,
2029-2033, should be adopted by decree at the same time as this revision of the strategy.
The baseline scenario in the revised SNBC outlines a possible trajectory for reducing greenhouse
gas emissions until carbon neutrality is achieved in 2050. It will be used to determine the fourth
carbon budget.
This scenario was established using work that has gained in precision for the short- and medium-
term hypotheses in comparison to the scenario forecast in the SNBC adopted in 2015 which was
used to set the first three carbon budgets.
The baseline scenario of the revised SNBC is both more ambitious, by aiming for carbon neutrality
across the whole country by 2050, and more realistic as regards how it proposes to achieve this,
in particular by adjusting our efforts over time. Indeed, the distribution across the sectors
described in this scenario is notably different from that in the 2015 SNBC. This change accounts
for the recent developments in the progression of the different sectors for the low carbon transition
and the sector-specific policies introduced at the start of the presidency.
The results of the emission projections for the periods 2019-2023 and 2024-2028 of the second
and third carbon budgets highlight:
 an overrun of the second carbon budget set by SNBC 1, which could be around 120 Mt
CO eq over the entire 2019-2023 period, i.e. 6% of the second budget,
2
 near-compliance (to within 2 Mt CO eq) with the third carbon budget, provided that all the
2
measures already put forward are implemented, including all the additional measures
considered in the reference scenario (cf. chapter 2.2.  “The baseline scenario”).
36 With no revision to the decree
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 35/176The difficulties faced in complying with the second budget are closely linked to the discrepancies
already noted in the first budget (cf. chapter 1.2 section C). The low price of energy is a cyclical
factor contributing to non-compliance at the beginning of the first carbon budget (this effect is
estimated at around 5 MtCO eq for the years 2015-2017). Prices have risen during the recent
2
period but the forecasts currently available still fall short of the forecast used during the adoption of
the first carbon budget in 2015. By 2020, the differences in imported products are respectively
-15% for oil, -20% for gas and -30% for coal. These levels are lower than those previously
estimated and will continue to impact the second carbon budget.
The distinctly worse results than forecast in the transport and building sectors for the 2015-2018
period were caused by structural factors that cannot be totally corrected nor offset at the time of
the second carbon budget. The slow pace of improvements in performance of new vehicles and of
the modal shift in the goods transport sector have been taken into account in the new SNBC
baseline scenario. The difficulties encountered in the building renovation domain (lower rate of
renovation and less significant impact than forecast) have also been accounted for.
In order to remain realistic, this has led us to revise the overall level of the second carbon budget
as well as restructure the distribution by sector. The distribution by sector in the second carbon
budget was 111 MtCO e for transport and 63 MtCO e for buildings. These levels have been
2 2
revised to 128 MtCO e and 78 MtCO e respectively. These increases are partially offset by a
2 2
downward adjustment of emissions in other sectors, particularly in energy production (sector
emissions down from 55 MtCO e to 48 MtCO e). In total, the carbon budget for the 2019-2023
2 2
period was thus modified from 398 MtCO e to 422 Mt CO e as an annual mean.
2 2
The upward adjustment of the second carbon budget does not however raise doubts as to
France’s ability to meet its European and international commitments. In application of the directive
on the European 2020 target, the level of French emissions not covered by the European
emissions quota trading market (emissions known as “ESD” or “ESR”) should be lower than 342
MtCO e37 in 2020. The mean emissions level over the 2019-2023 period of 321 MtCO e set in the
2 2
second carbon budget indeed guarantees that this objective will be met.
By the time of the third carbon budget, the climate plan of July 2017 and the measures adopted
within the framework of various sectoral or thematic initiatives (plan for the energy renovation of
buildings, mobility guidance law, energy-climate law, roadmap for the circular economy and draft
circular economy law, etc.) will have to be fully and effectively implemented, with regular
monitoring, in order to return to the levels of the budget adopted in 2015. This will be possible, for
example, thanks to the impetus given to the development of vehicles that do not emit greenhouse
gases or the emphasis placed on the fight against thermal sieves.  The sectoral distribution for the
third carbon budget is also revised, allocating the total amount marginally, in order to better take
into account the new trajectory envisaged in the reference scenario for each sector.

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 41/176CHAPTER 4 : PUBLIC POLICY GUIDELINES
4.1. Governance and implementation
The low-carbon transition implies a profound transformation of the French economy.   Its
implementation requires consistency of public action at all territorial scales with France's climate
commitments, which means integrating climate issues in each sector, each policy measure and at
each stage of project construction. To make this possible, every political decision-maker, at both
the national and territorial levels, must be mobilised.
i. National scale
A.Overview and challenges
By enshrining the ecological and climate emergency in law, France has confirmed that climate
change mitigation must be a top priority. This priority must now permeate all public policies. The
bodies already in place will make this possible:
 the Senior Sustainable Development Officials (HFDD) (body created in 2003), responsible
for contributing to the coordination and evaluation of public policies on sustainable
development within each ministry. They form a committee, chaired by the inter-ministerial
delegate for sustainable development, which leads and coordinates, on behalf of the Prime
Minister, the action of the State administrations in favour of sustainable development,
 the "big" ministry in charge of the environment, resulting from a merger in 2007 of the
ministries of the environment and equipment, in response to the ecological pact initiated by
Nicolas Hulot and signed by President Nicolas Sarkozy.
 the National Council for Ecological Transition, created in 2013, a forum for dialogue
representing local authorities, inter-professional trade unions, employers' organisations,
environmental protection associations, civil society and parliamentarians. It is consulted at
the request of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Ecological and Inclusive Transition, or
even on its own initiative, and issues opinions on ecological transition policy.
In addition, in the dual context of the 2018 social movement (“gilets jaunes” yellow jackets) and the
demand for stronger climate action (climate marches, student strike for the climate), governance
has been strengthened since the end of 2018 to ensure that climate objectives are taken into
account across the board with:
 The High Council for Climate (HCC), an independent body responsible for assessing the
public policies of the State and communities in the area of climate change mitigation.
Following the recommendations of its first annual report, "Acting Consistently with
Ambitions" of June 25, 2019, France's current and future major policy laws will be
evaluated from the perspective of their impact on greenhouse gases one year after their
implementation, thereby ensuring that climate issues be will considered in all national
public policies;
 The Ecological Defence Council, a body chaired by the President of the Republic that
brings together all members of the Government concerned by climate and environmental
issues, sets priorities for ecological transition and ensures that they are taken into account
in all State policies;
 The Citizens' Climate Convention, made up of a representative panel of 150 citizens
selected at random, is responsible for proposing unifying measures to achieve a reduction
of at least 40 per cent in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (compared to 1990) in a spirit
of social justice. 
The preparation of this document, which constitutes France's long-term strategy for achieving
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 42/176climate transition, also involved the departments of each ministry concerned41. This level of
mobilisation should be upheld during the implementation and monitoring phases of the SNBC.
Finally, the strategy and carbon budgets are legally enforceable for the public sector, mainly
through a link (cf. appendix 1 Legislative and regulatory context) between the strategy and:
 Planning and programming documents that have a significant impact on greenhouse gas
emissions (sectoral policy and regional planning documents).
 financing decisions for public projects, taken by public or private individuals. They should
take into account, among other criteria, the impact of the project in terms of greenhouse
gas emissions.
B. Strategy
It is therefore a question of implementing an integrated approach aimed at the appropriation of the
SNBC's guidelines and objectives with a view to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
conserving carbon sinks in all national public policy decisions (plans, programmes, bills, laws,
public procurement, public financing of projects, etc.).
a) Guideline NAT 1: Ensure the coherence of all national public
policies with the national low-carbon strategy
 Strengthen governance so that the guidelines and objectives of the SNBC are effectively
anchored in the broad spectrum of government policies:
◦ Take better account of the objectives and guidelines of the SNBC in all national public
policy decisions (plans, programmes, bills, laws, public procurement, public financing of
projects, etc.).
◦ Monitor the implementation of the strategy and evaluate the integration of SNBC
guidelines in all public policy documents.
 Assess the impact of national policies and measures in terms of greenhouse gas emissions
and ensure their alignment with the guidelines and objectives of the SNBC, in particular:
◦ Define and implement an ex-ante and ex-post assessment process to quantify
greenhouse gas emissions brought forward by bills with a significant impact on the
climate.
◦ Clarify the inclusion of climate objectives and SNBC guidelines in the elements required
for the impact assessment of bills.
◦ Ensure regular monitoring of the emissions impact of policies and measures, thus
allowing for useful feedback in order to identify existing obstacles and the potential of
measures and adjust them if necessary.
◦ Promote the  more systematic quantification of greenhouse gas emissions, both
territorial and imported, from public and private action plans, programmes and projects.
Facilitate approaches to avoid, reduce and offset these emissions by making
methodological guides available and ensuring their continuous improvement based on
feedback (see the 3rd point of EC guideline 2).
C. Monitoring and indicators
a) Main indicators of guideline NAT 1
 Indicators for the inclusion of guidelines in public policies
 Proportion of plans, programmes, bills and legislation that have been assessed for their
impact on greenhouse gas emissions
41 In particular the ministries that signed the decree adopting the SNBC and carbon budgets, i.e. the ministries in charge of
Ecological and Inclusive Transition, Territorial Cohesion and Relations with Local and Regional Authorities, Economy and Finance,
Labour, National Education and Youth, Agriculture and Food, Action and Public Accounts, Education, Research and Innovation and
Overseas France.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 43/176ii. Territorial scale
A.Overview
Regions and inter-municipalities play a major role in putting climate policies into action. According
to the IPCC, 75% of the levers for a successful ecological transition are territorial. Through the
regional schemes for land-use planning, sustainable development and equality of territories
(SRADDET), the regions ensure the territorialisation of national guidelines at the level of their
territory. They have a leading role on climate and energy, which consists in ensuring the
coordination of the authorities in their territory on these subjects. The regions can also, through
their competence in the areas of transport, agriculture and economic development, guide projects
in a virtuous direction from the point of view of ecological transition.
Inter-municipal authorities, for their part, ensure the concrete implementation of climate-friendly
measures.  They are in charge of drawing up territorial climate-air-energy plans (PCAETs), which
describe the climate trajectory of their territory and the actions planned in the short term by local
actors to take part in it. They also coordinate the energy transition after the adoption of their
PCAET, which enables them to be a unifying point for the stakeholders across their territory on this
subject. Finally, these authorities also play an operational role in the development of ecological
transition actions in their field of competence or sphere of influence and can rely on contractual
arrangements with the State such as Zero Waste Territories or Ecological Transition Contracts
(CTE).
The SNBC revision schedule did not allow the SRADDETs and PCAETs climate objectives to be
fully structured with those of the SNBC because of parallel development schedules with major
territorial reconfigurations of communities. The comparison of territorial objectives with territorial
scale objectives is difficult because of the heterogeneity of the methods used to define them.
Moreover, while these planning documents must take the SNBC into account, there is currently no
mechanism to ensure that the sum of territorial strategies is consistent with the national ambition.
A "territorial ecology" working group is responsible, in conjunction with associations of elected
officials, for defining a method and monitoring indicators to better relay the objectives of the
national strategies throughout the territory and ensure the shared monitoring of their rollout.
B.Strategy
Approximately 4/5 of the SNBC guidelines require the commitment of the territories because of the
competences already allocated to them, but also because of the development of a transition model
that promotes the relocation of a certain number of activities and decisions as close as possible to
the catchment areas.
While the SNBC sets guidelines and quantified objectives on a national scale, these do not apply
uniformly to each territory due to great disparities in potential and resources. The breakdown of
the carbon neutrality objective on a territorial scale does not mean strict uniformity of the actions
undertaken. On the contrary, all territories must mobilize their specific potential to be part of the
SNBC's trajectory.
The development of each territory's potential leads to the enhancement of cooperation between
territories through the flow of resources, materials, energy, etc., but also by offsetting the residual
emissions of some by a significant increase in the carbon absorption capacities of others. New
links between territories, at all scales, are therefore bound to develop.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 44/176a) Guideline   TER   1:   Develop   governance   arrangements   that
facilitate the territorial implementation of the carbon neutrality
objective
 Maintain the State-Regions dialogue on how  the objectives of the regional schemes for
land-use planning, sustainable development and equality of territories (SRADDET) and the
territorial climate-air-energy plans (PCAET) tie in with the SNBC and ensure that this
dialogue is also conducted between the Regions and their inter-municipalities. Set up a
mechanism to integrate the SRADDET guidelines into future work on the revision of the
SNBC. Conversely, ensure that the indicators of the national low-carbon strategy are taken
into account in the monitoring of the SRADDETs.
 Widen the breadth of the coordination role of communities with a territorial climate-air-
energy plan (PCAET) to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in their territory and
the development of carbon sinks. Incorporate indicators on carbon stocks and sinks in the
monitoring of territorial climate-air-energy-plans and urban planning documents.
 Develop regional alliances between local authorities and/or territorial actors, particularly as
regards the economy at the territorial level or allowing carbon neutrality.
 Integrate the issue of climate change mitigation into the actions of cooperation and
dialogue structures on an intermediate scale between regions and inter-municipalities
(country and territorial and rural balance clusters, metropolitan clusters, local water
commissions, national parks and regional nature parks, etc.).
b) Guideline TER 2: Develop a data offer that makes it possible to
compare   territorial   transition   trajectories   with   the   national
trajectory.
 Standardize the data and working methods used in the preparation of climate planning
documents to facilitate the articulation of plans among them, in particular for the definition
of   targets,   indicators   and   monitoring   arrangements.   Strengthen   regional   climate
observatories to enable the production of regular, comparable and supplementary territorial
data.

4.2. Cross-sectoral guidelines
i. Carbon footprint
A.Overview and challenges
The carbon footprint is a calculation of the national contribution to global warming from the
consumer's point of view. Given the global nature of climate issues and in the current context of a
globalised economy, it is useful to observe the greenhouse gas emissions associated with French
consumption, taking into account the emissions linked to the production of imported goods and
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 45/176services42.
In 2018, the carbon footprint (estimated at 749 Mt CO eq) is 1.8 times larger than territorial
2
emissions (425 Mt CO eq on a perimeter identical to that of the carbon footprint: CO , CH  and
2 2 4
N O).The gap between inventory and footprint is explained by the GHG content of French imports.
2
This content is greater than that of exports of domestic production (in total and per euro). French
imports are intended to ensure the final consumption of households but also the intermediate
consumption of domestic economic activities. Between 1995 and 2014, in current euros, domestic
final demand grew by 81% and intermediate consumption of economic activities by 90%. The
share of imports intended to meet households and businesses needs is tending to increase.
The figure below compares the changes in greenhouse gas emissions included in the carbon
footprint (emissions of the territory excluding exports to which are added the emissions associated
with the foreign production of imported goods and services including international transport) and
those accounted for in the national inventory (emissions of the territory including exports). For the
carbon footprint, we can note that since 1995, the share of imported emissions has been rising,
while territorial emissions have been falling. As for the inventory, the reduction in territorial
emissions is mainly due to significant decreases noted in the manufacturing and energy industry
sectors.
Comparing the carbon footprint with the national inventory
On a per capita basis, in 2018, the carbon footprint of the French (11.2 tCO eq per person) is
2
slightly higher than in 1995 (10.5 tCO eq per person). In terms of trends, emissions associated
2
with imports have increased by 1.7% per year on average since 2010, and emissions from
metropolitan France (households and economic activities excluding exports) have decreased by
1.6% per year on average over the same period.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in a report on the effects of a 1.5°C
warming published in October 2018, specified the cumulative amount of CO  that could still be
2
42 see Appendix 4. Interests and complementarity of the territorial emissions and consumption emissions approaches
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 46/176emitted while not exceeding a 2°C warming in 2100.   Taking into account the evolution of the
world's population between now and 2100 and respecting a strictly egalitarian distribution of the
amount of CO  that would remain to be emitted, the CO  "budget" of each Earthman should be
2 2
between 1.6 t (low hypothesis) and 2.8 t (high hypothesis) of CO  per year between now and
2
2100. With 8 t of CO  per person per year43, the French footprint is too high. The current overruns
2
will have to be compensated for by significant future reductions.
Compatibility of the carbon footprint with a global warming limited to +2°C
Fossil Fuels: Distinguishing between Domestic and Import-Related Emissions
Imports of petroleum products, natural gas and coal contribute to the carbon footprint. However,
not all emissions related to these fuels are considered as "import emissions". In defining the
carbon footprint, the distinction between domestic and imported emissions is based on where the
greenhouse gases were emitted.  When a barrel of oil is imported into France, the "emissions
associated with imports" of the carbon footprint accounts for the GHGs emitted for the
manufacture (in particular extraction processes) and transport of the product.  If this oil is refined
and consumed in France, the emissions associated with refining and consumption, for example in
the form of petrol, are counted in the national emissions.
For the 20 categories of products that emit the most GHG gases, the figure below compares the
emissions unit content (i.e. greenhouse gas content) per euro of added value of final domestic44
demand of goods and services. For comparison, the figure also presents the greenhouse gas unit
content of imported goods and services and that of domestically produced goods and services.
First of all, the emissions unit content of all the products is lower when they are produced in
France. This difference is primarily due to the relatively high levels of nuclear-generated electricity
in the French energy mix. This “low carbon” electricity, consumed to produce all goods and
services, contributes to decreasing their greenhouse gas unit content. The relative importance of

44 Final domestic demand refers to the consumption of goods and services by households, public authorities and non-profit
institutions serving households and to investments. Exports are excluded.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 47/176tertiary activities in the French economy also contributes to containing the GHG intensity of French
domestic production.
However, other factors should be taken into account in comparing these products’ greenhouse gas
unit contents:
 for the same category, products manufactured in France may be different in nature from
those produced abroad (e.g. mineral extraction belongs to the same product category as
coal extraction);
 some national activities are too small to be represented. This is the case, for example, for
the extraction of petroleum products;
 the incorporation of emissions from international transport into the carbon content of
imported products.

carbon footprint
The share of each type of consumption contributing to the carbon footprint is illustrated in the
graph below: for each major type of consumption, details are given of the share of consumption
between direct household emissions and emissions for economic activities (domestic and
imported). The main types of consumption contributing to the carbon footprint are: housing,
transport and food.
With regard to the "housing" item, direct household emissions correspond to GHG emissions from
fuels (fuel oil and natural gas) burned in housing boilers; 43% of emissions from domestic
production and imports come from the production of construction materials (steel, cement, plastic
materials) and 38% from the production and transport of electricity, gas and heat consumed in
housing.
With regard to the "transport" item, direct household emissions correspond to the GHGs emitted
by the combustion of fuels in cars. Emissions from imports and domestic production come from
the manufacture of fuels (54%), from the manufacture of transport vehicles and equipment (22%)
and from the various transport services (24%; road freight, airlines and shipping companies, public
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 48/176transport, taxis, etc.).
As regards the food item, emissions come from agricultural production and the agro-food industry,
including transport and product marketing. Emissions are evenly distributed between domestic
production and imports.
The carbon footprint per consumption form in 2018
B. Strategy
Beyond the goal of attaining carbon neutrality for France (territorial scale), the national low carbon
strategy also aims to reduce the overall French carbon footprint.
Reducing the French carbon footprint involves reducing emissions from the consumption of goods
and services by French people, whether produced within the national territory or imported,
including emissions for international transport (not counted in the territorial emissions).
In the French situation, imports that substitute national production generally degrade the carbon
footprint. This is especially the case if the imported product is manufactured in a region where the
energy mix is more carbon-reliant, the regulation in place less ambitious and the technologies
used generate more emissions. This effect should be prevented by:
 Promoting the global climate ambition and that of our trade partners in particular, and
making use of the various carbon markets across the world, as well as the carbon taxes
already in place or under development in many countries.
 Prioritising production within the national territory if it is less emitting, and reducing the risk
of carbon leakage, which is the delocalisation of a production site to avoid climate
regulation (cf. chapter 4.2.v. “Industry”).
In addition to the guidelines presented below, certain sectoral and cross-cutting guidelines are
more specifically dedicated to reducing imported emissions, such as the development of short and
seasonal sectors, the circular economy, bio-based materials and energy produced from local
resources, etc. In fact, the circularisation of material and energy flows in the economy is one of the
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 49/176necessary conditions for reducing the need for imported products, and thus for reducing the
associated emissions.  This is the case, for example, when the use of industrial waste heat in an
urban heating network makes it possible to avoid the use of imported fossil fuels and therefore
reduce the carbon footprint associated with housing.
The anti-waste law for a circular economy, adopted by Parliament at the beginning of January
2020, aims to respond to the issues related to the fight against the various forms of waste and the
transformation of our economy into a more circular economy. It is structured around four main
guidelines:
 Put an end to the different forms of waste in order to preserve natural resources;
 Strengthen consumer information so that consumers can make informed choices;
 Mobilize economic actors to transform production and distribution methods;
Improve the collection and sorting of waste in order to encourage recovery, reuse and recycling,
and combating illegal dumping.
In terms of bio-based resources in particular, the principles of the national strategy on imported
deforestation should be taken into account in order to avoid importing unsustainable biomass
resources.
The European directive on renewable energies, adopted in December 2018, provides for the
freezing of biofuels with a high risk of indirect land-use change (CASI) from 2019. It foresees their
phasing out from 2023 to 2030.
Continuing the international climate policies (implementing the Paris Agreement, developing
“green” finance as envisaged at the One Planet Summit) will contribute to reducing the
greenhouse gas content of French imports.
It should be noted that many climate regulations are decided at European level - particularly the
texts on the emissions trading scheme (ETS) and effort sharing for emissions falling outside the
trading scheme (ESR) - which is conducive to a harmonised reduction of European emissions and
consequently of the greenhouse gas content of imports from other EU countries.
a) Guideline E-C 1: improve control of the carbon content of
imported products
 Prioritize initiatives that embody the principle of carbon pricing for the majority of global
greenhouse gas emissions towards a pricing level that is compatible with achieving the
Paris Agreement goals (cf. the report by Stern and Stiglitz45), and reduce the carbon
intensity of production tools at a global scale (cf. chapter 4.2.v. “Industry”).
 In order to fight against carbon leakage, promote, within the framework of the European
Green Pact, the implementation of a pricing system at Europe's borders (carbon inclusion
mechanism), compatible with the rules of the World Trade Organisation.
 Encourage the EU's partner countries in trade agreements to implement more ambitious
low-carbon policies. For example, the reduction of imported emissions related to
agricultural products must be taken into account in future trade agreements and more
globally through the implementation of the National Strategy to Combat Imported
Deforestation (SNDI).
 Launch a debate on measures subjecting imported products to the same eco-design
constraints as goods produced in the European Union.
b) Guideline E-C 2: encourage all economic players to better
manage their carbon footprint
45 Report of the High Level Commission on Carbon Prices, 2017, Washington, DC: World Bank
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 50/176 Encourage accounting of indirect emissions (scope 3) in greenhouse gas emissions
balances (bilans d’émissions de gaz à effet de serre, BEGES) and encourage voluntary
BEGES.
 Encourage carbon footprint calculation and communication for products and services
marketed (see also chapter 4.1.v. “Citizens’ education, awareness, and assimilation of
issues and solutions”).
 Promote the more systematic quantification of greenhouse gas emissions, both territorial
and imported, from public and private action plans, programmes and projects. Facilitate
approaches to avoid, reduce and offset these emissions by making methodological guides
available and ensuring their continuous improvement based on feedback (see Appendix 7:
Offsetting greenhouse gas emissions).
 Develop the use of carbon footprint calculation tools for all economic actors, including
consumers, SMEs and VSEs, in order to provide them with adequate information and the
means of assuming their responsibilities to combat climate change through their
consumption of goods and services.
 Monitor and ensure the homogeneity of the methods used to calculate the carbon footprint
in the different sectors and at different scales (products, territories, national, etc.), to
guarantee a robust assessment of the carbon footprint at the national level and in line with
the analyses carried out at the territorial level, in particular the EPCIs via the territorial
climate-air-energy plans (PCAETs).
Train economic actors regarding the challenges and needs of the low carbon transition; this is
addressed in chapter 4.1.vi. “Jobs, skills, training and professional qualifications”.
c) Encourage all citizens to better manage their carbon footprint
Cf. guidelines in chapter 4.1.v. “Citizens’ education, awareness, and assimilation of issues and
solutions”. In particular, advertising regulation (cf. guideline CIT 1: “enriching and sharing the low
carbon culture”) can prevent high carbon footprint products being promoted to consumers. See
also guideline CIT 2: “assisting citizens in their own low carbon transition”
d) Area of concern
- As regards guideline E-C 1, particular attention will have to be paid to the issues of energy and
material consumption, recyclability and reparability of digital equipment.
C. Monitoring and indicators

ii. Economic policy
A.Overview and challenges
a) Investments
The work conducted by the Institute for Climate Economics (I4CE) estimates public and private
investment spending on climate change in France at €45.7 billion in 201846, i.e. an increase of
17% over the last three years and 4.6% between 2017 and 2018.
Climate-friendly investments in France
46 According to I4CE's latest Landscape of Climate Finance in France (2019 edition), https://www.i4ce.org/download/edition-2019-
panorama-financements-climat/
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 52/176Nevertheless, the same work estimates that an additional €15 to 18 billion/year would be needed
to meet the objectives of the 2nd carbon budget (2019-2023), and €32 to 41 billion/year to meet the
3rd  carbon budget (2024-2028), i.e. a doubling of current "climate" investments. Among the
additional investments needed: €2 to 8 billion/year are for buildings (mainly in renovation), €9 to 23
billion/year for transport, and €5 to 10 billion/year for energy and electricity networks.
Large public and private investments will thus be necessary to attain carbon neutrality. This does
not mean that new resources must be mobilised in every instance. Indeed, part of the investments
to be made cover spending that would have had to be disbursed in any case, for example building
housing and renewing the vehicle fleet. It is therefore about ensuring a net increase in funding as
much as a question of redirecting funding that is currently adverse to the climate towards more
climate-friendly investments.  For example, I4CE's 2019 Landscape of Climate Finance in France
shows that out of the 22 billion euros/year to be devoted to investment in electric vehicles by the
3rd carbon budget for 2024-2028, the additional cost compared to a fleet made up solely of internal
combustion vehicles is only 4 billion euros/year.
The following table provides a breakdown of annual investment needs for the three main sectors
and by period, produced by the Ministry for an Ecological and Inclusive Transition, using a
methodology similar to that of I4CE: 
Investment requirements in the SNBC (in billions€/year)47
2019-2023 2024-2028 2029-2033 2034-2050
Building sector 14 18 22 28
Transport 21 36 52 85
Energy and networks 11 10 11 13
Total 46 64 85 126
We should note that some of these investments could generate significant use savings (for
example for carbon-free vehicles and energy renovation).
b) Tutelary carbon values
The tutelary carbon value is the value for the public authority of efforts allowing the emission of
one tonne of CO  equivalent to be avoided. It is a reference that the local authority uses to select
2
actions useful in the fight against climate change by evaluating:
 the path to be taken to achieve carbon neutrality as set out in the Paris Agreement of 2015
and the energy-climate law of November 11, 2019;
This value is intended to be used in the development and evaluation of the various measures
promoting private investment and carbon-free behaviour (explicit carbon pricing, bonus-malus
systems, investment subsidies, regulations, etc.), without however making it possible to set the
level and rate per instrument on this basis alone. It provides a benchmark against which to
compare the socio-economic cost of different public policies per tonne of greenhouse gas avoided,
which is only one of the elements to be taken into account when designing measures. In particular,
the trajectory of the tutelary value of carbon can be used as a guideline when establishing the
47 DGEC figures established in line with the SNBC scenarios. Investments in buildings are derived from the sectoral models used in
the SNBC and correspond mainly to renovations. An additional cost for the construction of new buildings built to RT2012 standards
and future environmental regulations for new buildings compared to buildings built with RT2005 is also taken into account
(estimated additional cost of €3.5bn/year over the entire period). Transport investments are mainly based on figures produced by
the COI (Infrastructure guidance council) for infrastructures and on the sectoral models used within the framework of the SNBC for
vehicles. They correspond to investment needs in sustainable transport infrastructure (around €11 to 12 billion/year over the entire
period), as well as the cost of deploying charging infrastructure and alternative fuels and the investment cost (purchase cost) of
low-carbon vehicles. The purchase cost of low-carbon vehicles is to become prevalent at the end of the period (insofar as these
vehicles then account for all vehicle purchases). Energy investments were assessed based on the figures used by the Ministry in
the PPE work. They include investments related to the nuclear sector and investments in renewable energies (wind, photovoltaic,
anaerobic digestion, etc.). The green investments thus quantified mainly reflect a redeployment of investments rather than an
increase in investment. Investments in other sectors have not been the subject of a precise assessment by the DGEC in the
context of this work. Investments in the energy sector include investments linked to the nuclear sector and investments in
renewable energies (wind, photovoltaic, anaerobic digestion, etc.).
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 53/176carbon component; however, it is not intended to be applied directly because other issues must be
taken into account (impact on households and businesses, increase in support measures, etc.).
 the monetary value that society must place on sectoral actions and public investments that
allow convergence towards this objective at the lowest cost.
It is used for the socio-economic assessment of public investment projects, in order to identify the
most profitable for the community, taking into account in particular their contribution to the
decarbonisation of the economy and their alignment with France's climate objectives.
A new trajectory for the tutelary value has been proposed by the commission chaired by Alain
Quinet, which delivered its report on The Value of Climate Action in February 2019. This new
trajectory, built around a pivotal value of €250 per tonne of CO e in 2030 and consistent with the
2
objective of carbon neutrality in 2050, will have to be used in the future.
c) Carbon pricing
The objective of carbon pricing is to contribute to the achievement of GHG emission reduction
targets. It makes it possible to influence the choices of economic players and to promote green
innovation by:
 making investments that promote gains in energy efficiency more profitable;
 promoting the transition to less carbon-intensive energy sources.
Carbon pricing is also an application of the "polluter pays" principle, as stated in Article 4 of the
Environmental Charter. 48
Several economic instruments currently in use at national and European levels enable carbon to
be priced in order to steer investments towards carbon-free technologies and encourage
behaviour changes, as a complement to measures that assist the actors in the transition:
  Carbon component in energy taxation :
A carbon component is included in domestic consumption taxes on energy products, natural
gas and coal. Its level is 44.6 €/tCO  in 2018 and 2019, generating revenue of around €8
2
billion, with a target of 100 €/tCO  set by the LTECV for 2015. The increases initially voted
2
for the years 2019-2022 have been suspended. At the same time, measures to support
households have been improved (increase in the energy voucher and broadening of its
base).
  A tax incentive on HFC refrigerant gases   is planned from 2021 to encourage the
substitution of these products with high heating power.
  the European carbon market (  European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, EU ETS  ) :
Although it has increased over the recent period, the current price of allowances (€25 per
tonne of CO   at the beginning of November 2019) remains below the values deemed
2
compatible with the objectives of the Paris Agreement (see in particular the Stern-Stiglitz
report49). The recent revision of the European directive covering the quotas market should
lead to an increase in these prices, thanks to two main mechanisms:
 the introduction from 2019 onwards of a market stability reserve, which, by setting
aside and cancelling allowances, will make it possible to reduce the current excess
of allowances in circulation, which weighs negatively on prices;
 a faster annual reduction in the annual quota ceiling and the number of quotas in
circulation each year, starting in 2021.
48 In 2005, the Environmental Charter was incorporated into the constitutional framework of French law, recognising the
fundamental rights and duties relating to environmental protection. It introduces three main principles into the Constitution: the
prevention principle, the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle.
49 The High-Level Commission on Carbon Pricing (led by N. Stern and J. Stiglitz) estimated in 2017 that a carbon price should reach
$40 to $80/tCO  in 2020 (and $50 to $100/tCO  in 2030) to be aligned with the objectives of the Paris agreement.
2 2
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 54/176Voluntary emissions offsetting:
The Ministry for an Ecological and Inclusive Transition officially launched a low carbon label
in April 201950, which provides a framework for the recognition of greenhouse gas emissions
avoided through reduction projects in France. The emissions recognised in this way can be
attributed to the company funding the project to offset its emissions on a voluntary basis.
This will thus contribute to setting a price for the greenhouse gas emissions of businesses
while supporting low carbon initiatives in a range of sectors.
d) Funding
In terms of public finance management, France has been experimenting, since drafting the
2020 budget, with a process for analysing the environmental impact of the State's fiscal and
budgetary instruments (Green Budget approach). This approach, conducted for the first time in
2019, aims to ensure transparency on the environmental nature of the expenditure and
revenue that make up its budget, as well as to improve the environmental impact of its budget in
the future. In 2019, the first financial year51 records a minimum of €17.5 billion of expenditure
unfavourable to climate change mitigation, including €13.9 billion of tax expenditure52, and around
€29 billion of favourable expenditure for this same theme. A systematic assessment of the entire
budget will be published with each budget bill starting with the 2021 budget.
Similarly, the launch of a sovereign green bond in January 2017, with an outstanding amount of
approximately €20.7 billion, will make it possible to set high standards in the green bond market,
notably through ex-post environmental impact reporting of spending.
On a finer scale, the assessment of the climate impact and the compatibility of public investment
projects53 with the SNBC (including projects financed by local authorities) needs to be further
strengthened:
 by generalising socio-economic assessments beyond the usual sectors of application
(transport or public buildings);
 by adopting a broad vision of the climate impact of projects (impacts throughout the life of
the projects and indirect impacts);
 by ensuring that projects are compatible with the public policy guidelines necessary for the
low-carbon transition.
The use of the new "climate action value" from the Quinet report (2019) in the assessments should
help to assess the suitability of the projects studied with the objective of carbon neutrality in 2050.
Finally, State support for international companies, in particular export guarantees, is now
enshrined in law54:
 the end of State export guarantees granted for (i) coal exploration, use and production and
power generation from coal, (ii) exploration, use and production of gaseous or liquid
hydrocarbons using hydraulic fracturing and other non-conventional methods of extraction,
and (iii) production of liquid hydrocarbons involving routine flaring;
 In 2020, setting out scenarios for ending state guarantees for foreign trade for research
and exploitation projects of new oil and gas fields, as well as defining a methodology for
developing environmental performance standards with the aim of making the granting of
state export guarantees conditional on operations with direct high or medium-level
potentially negative environmental and social impacts.

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 55/176Guiding private financing towards climate-friendly financing is based on several rationales:
 Sectoral policies aimed at requiring or encouraging private actors to engage in the
transition. These are the regulations, subsidies or prohibitions described in the sectoral
parts of the SNBC;
 Carbon pricing policies described above aimed at improving the profitability of low-carbon
investments compared to carbon investments;
 Incentive policies for financial players, which is the subject of this section.
Several incentive tools already exist to encourage financial actors to better account for the risks
linked to climate change and to redirect public and private finance flows towards actions coherent
with the Paris Agreement. With Article 173-VI of the energy transition for green growth act in 2015,
France has become a pioneer in requiring investors to be more transparent with regard to their
consideration of climate change risks in their investment strategies and their contribution to long-
term environmental policy objectives. The energy-climate law, enacted in November 2019, aligns
this article with the recent European regulation on the transparency of financial actors, known as
the "Disclosure" regulation, and extends it to biodiversity issues.
The “green finance” labels will allow us to better target projects that contribute to the energy and
ecological transition (transition énergétique et écologique, TEE) and provide a guarantee of the
environmental quality of investments. The “Greenfin” label (transition énergétique et écologique
pour le climat,  TEEC) targets green investment funds. It guarantees the transparency and
environmental commitment of financial products, and aims to increase investments that benefit the
energy and ecological transition and combat climate change. Launched at the end of 2015 to
complete the regulatory component of the energy transition for green growth act (LTECV), it
extends the scope of the law to include property funds. In November 2019, it had 36 labelled funds
outstanding by €10.5 billion. The “Participative funding for green growth” label, launched at the end
of 2017, encourages participative funding of projects working to promote the energy and ecological
transition. Since its launch, the total collected for labelled projects stands at €16.2 million.
At the European level, work to implement the European Commission's Sustainable Finance Action
Plan of March 2018 has resulted in the adoption of two regulations, one on low-carbon
benchmarks and the other on sustainability disclosures. Discussions are continuing on the
regulation on the classification of sustainable economic activities (taxonomy), which will make it
possible to agree on a common vocabulary and would also be the basis on which the European
labels for sustainable financial products and the future European standard for green bonds will be
developed.
Additionally, many initiatives currently exist that aim to enlist international financial players.
Thus, among the commitments of Climate Finance Day in 2017, the PACTE law now includes, for
example, the "greening" of life insurance or the channelling of savings invested in the Livret
développement durable et solidaire (LDDS) savings account towards projects that effectively
contribute to the energy transition or the reduction of the climate footprint of our economic model.
In this context, the PACTE law (law for the growth and transformation of companies), adopted in
April 2019, is an important lever for the greening of finance: it will require insurers to offer units of
account (UA) dedicated to sustainable finance. As of 2020, they will have to present at least one
SRI, Finansol or Greenfin-labelled solution to savers. In 2022, at least one product of each will
have to be offered: a responsible unit, a solidarity unit and a green unit with the Greenfin label.
The One Planet Summit was also a strong symbol of stakeholders’55mobilisation with, in particular,
the commitment of 237 companies, representing a market capitalisation of more than USD 6.3
billion, to follow the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures
(TCFD encourages extra-financial reporting in accordance with Article 173-VI), the launch of the
Coalition 100+ by 225 investors, with the objective of encouraging the 100 listed companies that
emit the most greenhouse gases to act against climate change, the commitment of six sovereign
wealth funds to integrate climate change into their investment decisions, as well as the launch of
the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), created at the initiative of the Banque de

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 56/176France and the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Régulation (ACPR) in December 2017. This
network now has 46 members and 9 observers, including the International Monetary Fund. Finally,
the “Finance for Tomorrow” initiative - instigated by players at the Paris stock exchange - provides
a solid structure for the green financial ecosystem and showcases French sustainable financing
internationally.
Since climate changes is a global issue, the developed countries, including France, have
committed under the UNFCCC to 100 billion dollars per year of climate funding from 2020 to 2025
to promote climate action in developing countries. France had pledged to increase its climate
financing for developing countries to 5 billion euros per year by 2020: this objective was reached in
2018 with 5.08 billion euros.
B. Strategy
Considering the investment needs, and in line with the Paris Agreement (article 2.1), it is crucial to
redirect public and private financial flows so that they can contribute to meeting Paris Agreement
targets, ensuring this funding is effective and shifting financial flows away from investments that
harm the climate. This requires:
 coherent sectoral policies that encourage the financing of transition, prohibit or regulate
polluting practices, etc.
 a price signal for carbon and greenhouse gases which, in a cross-cutting manner, improves
the profitability of low-carbon investments, including in the long term;
 public and private financial players to take into account the risks linked to the climate
(anticipate the effects of climate change or asset depreciation due to climate policies, for
example a coal power station closed because the carbon price is too high) and the
associated opportunities (investments becoming profitable through the strengthening of
climate policies and particularly the rise in carbon prices);
 better information on the consideration of climate effects by investors and businesses;
 shared methodologies to identify investments that favour the transition to a low carbon
economy and provide assurance of their effectiveness;
 research and development on these indicators and information systems;
 consideration of the greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal in the allocation of public
funds;
 improved coordination at international and especially European level.
All these aims echo the recommendation in the “For a French strategy for green finance” report,
co-authored by Sylvie Lemmet and Pierre Ducret and presented to Nicolas Hulot and Bruno Le
Maire during the Climate Finance Day in December 2017. One year later, in December 2018, the
Canfin-Zaouati report "For the gradual implementation of France Transition - risk-sharing
mechanisms to mobilize 10 billion euros of private investment in ecological transition" was
submitted to the Ministers of Ecological and Inclusive Transition and the Minister of Economy and
Finance. The creation of France Transition Ecologique was announced during the first Ecological
Defence Council in May 2019. This initiative aims to bring together public and private financial
actors to help deploy on a large scale operational and proven solutions in favour of ecological
transition. The energy renovation of buildings, agro-ecology, the electric vehicle or incentive pricing
are among the themes that France Transition Ecologique could address.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 57/176a) Guideline   ECO 1:   send   the   right   signals   to   investors,
particularly on carbon prices, and give them a clear long-term
view of climate policies
 Update the methodological framework for socio-economic assessments of investments and
public orders by incorporating the new trajectory of the tutelary carbon value.
 Strengthen the pricing of greenhouse gases by strengthening the price signal and
incentives to reduce HFC emissions.
 Phase out public “subsidies” that damage the environment (particularly exemptions from
environmental taxes and from submission to carbon pricing).
 Take better account of the pressure that may eventually be placed on carbon-free energy
resources, as well as the negative externalities such as pressure on land and land take.
These tensions and negative externalities can be accounted for through market signals and
if necessary through other economic instruments (such as charging for road use) or
regulatory instruments.
 Provide the economic players with a clear long-term view of climate policies in order to
avoid “failed” investments in assets that go against the climate action, and to avoid the
“ratchet effect”.
 Encourage/promote   climate/environment   information   and   transparency   on   financial
products. To this end, promote the development of green financial products through labels,
standards and regulations on extra-financial reporting (e.g. European eco-label, low-carbon
products, "2°C" aligned products). In this respect, ensure the implementation and follow-up
of the announcements made during Climate Finance Day on the greening of unit-linked
products in life insurance products provided for by the PACTE law.
b) Guideline ECO 2: ensuring a fair transition for all
 Take into account the socio-economic impacts of measures associated with the low-carbon
transition on all stakeholders in society. Ensure the sustainability of these measures.
 Protect the purchasing power of households by favouring, as far as possible, socially just
and redistributive measures.  Otherwise, define targeted support measures to help offset
the regressive effects of the measures, taking into account not only household income, but
also the plethora of situations (accessibility to mobility solutions, type of housing, type of
heating, etc.).
 Preserve the competitiveness of companies, particularly those impacted by the increase in
taxation (notably due to the reduction of tax niches) linked to the low-carbon transition, by
implementing targeted support measures taking into account the characteristics of the
different sectors concerned in order to encourage companies to make the investments
necessary for the low-carbon transition while maintaining their activities in France.
c) Guideline ECO 3: support European and international action on
finance and carbon pricing in line with the Paris Agreement
 Support the funding of climate action in the most vulnerable and least developed countries.
 Increase the share of funds in line with the Paris Agreement in the European Union budget
and establish a common classification and nomenclature in the European Union for climate
investments, based on a rigorous control framework.
 Promote a standardised approach to carbon prices in Europe, including through the
establishment of a floor price or price corridor within the European Emissions Trading
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 58/176Scheme, in order to improve the visibility of economic actors. Support the development of
carbon pricing to increase the coverage of GHG emissions, in particular for Member States
and sectors currently not subject to carbon pricing. However, EU climate policy should not
be limited to carbon pricing, even if it is comprehensive and standardised. Emissions
regulations and standards are also powerful public policies that provide economic signals
to industry and consumers in addition to a carbon price.
 See also the guidelines in chapter 4.1.i. Carbon footprint, in particular concerning the
introduction of carbon pricing at Europe's borders to combat the phenomenon of carbon
leakage (displacement of greenhouse gas emissions to regions of the world with lower
climate requirements.
 Expand the Paris Collaborative process on Green Budgeting led by the OECD that aims to
analyse the coherence of the national public finance trajectory with environmental and
climate   goals,   and   to   promote  transparency   and   effective   leadership   in   public
environmental policies.
d) Guideline   ECO   4:   encourage   investments   in   low   carbon
transition   projects   by  developing   financial   tools   that   limit
investor risk and define robust criteria for determining which
projects are beneficial to the low carbon transition.
 Continue the work of France Transition Ecologique in order to set up financial instruments
aimed at using public money as a risk-sharing tool, in order to strengthen the involvement
of   private  investors  in  the   financing   of   ecological   and  energy  transition  sectors
encountering an investment deficit.
 Supporting the work of the European Commission on sustainable finance. Several actions
are being implemented in this context, such as the taxonomy of sustainable economic
activities, as well as the regulations published in December 2019 on extra-financial
information for investors and on low-carbon indices. Within the framework of this
"Sustainable Finance Package", the aim is to be particularly attentive to the environmental
ambition of the legislative proposals and in all their variations.
e) Guideline ECO 5: develop the analysis of the climate impacts
of actions financed by public funds and public policies, in
order to make it a decision-making criterion. Ensure that the
actions that run counter to efforts to meet our climate goals do
not benefit from public funding.
 Pursue the implementation of a transparent "green budget" approach to government
expenditure and revenue,  and create the  conditions to extend this approach to
communities;
 Gradually phase out expenditure identified as negative for climate change mitigation, by
providing targeted support to the sectors and actors concerned within the framework of a
transparent democratic debate;
 Gradually align international corporate financing with the Paris Agreement, starting with
defining an approach to ceasing to grant public guarantees to foreign trade for research
and development projects for new oil and gas fields.
f) Areas of concern
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 59/176 Ensure that income generated by carbon taxes and markets is used correctly, in
accordance with the government’s goals for public funding. This income can then fund
actions in favour of the low carbon transition (funding of public policies or projects) and
policies aiming to mitigate the negative impacts of the low carbon transition on actors or the
economy in general (see guideline ECO2).
 In order to ensure a fair transition, assist households, particularly those with the lowest
incomes (for example households subject to fuel poverty), workers and negatively
impacted regions, as well as businesses exposed to international competition (see
guideline ECO2).
 Ensure that no technology is excluded a priori from public investment and support schemes
so as not to miss out on unanticipated breakthrough technologies (technological neutrality)
while taking into account the risks of stranded assets and carbon lock-in.
 Foster projects that also have other environmental benefits and limit those that could have
negative impacts (resources, biodiversity, pollution etc.).

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 60/176iii. Research and innovation policy
A.Overview and challenges
a) Key Issues
The transition to a low carbon economy (moderate consumption of materials and energy, very
circular and carbon free) requires technological breakthroughs, innovation and the adaptation of
patterns of production and consumption. This requires more research and innovation efforts in
order to develop technologies and behaviours that contribute to reducing French emissions to
attain carbon neutrality and to better position France in these promising sectors to be able to
compete on future markets and offer low carbon goods and services.
Many needs specific to research and innovation have been identified:
 in the energy sectors, on energy decarbonisation, energy efficiency, energy storage,
intelligent management of transport and distribution networks, as well as solutions to
capture, store and reuse carbon;
 in   the   non-energy   sectors   (industrial   processes,   agricultural   practices,   forestry
management, land management, etc.), for the improvement of processes aimed at
"carbon" and environmental efficiency and the optimisation of material and energy
recovery;
 on social innovations (change in behaviour, conduct and assimilation of the changes etc.)
and organisational innovations (public policies etc.).
These needs, in terms of meeting the low-carbon transition challenge, will mobilise all the players
involved in low-carbon research and innovation actions nationally, but also across Europe and
internationally.
b) Existing plans and strategies
At European level, the strategic energy technology plan (SET Plan) aims to introduce a European
cooperation policy to accelerate the development and deployment of low carbon technologies.
At national level, the French National Research Strategy (Stratégie Nationale de Recherche) is
built around 10 great challenges for society, including: “Careful resource management and
adaptation to climate change”, “Clean, safe and efficient energy” and “Sustainable transport and
urban systems”. The National Energy Research Strategy represents the energy section of the
strategy. It comprises four guidelines:
1. Target the key themes for the energy transition
2. Develop Research & Development & Innovation (R&D&I) in connection with the regions
and industrial fabric, particularly for small and medium businesses and "mid-caps"
companies
3. Develop skills and knowledge for and by the R&D&I
4. Create light-touch, effective governance to provide dynamic operational management
of the National Energy Research Strategy.
c) Support and funding
France's annual public funding of research in the field of new energy technologies (renewable
energies, energy efficiency, carbon capture and use, storage and networks, fundamental research)
will amount to €515 million in 2018, according to the nomenclature proposed by the International
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 61/176Energy Agency, i.e. 44% of France's research expenditure in the field of energy.
In parallel to funding public research organisations, the State supports R&D actions through
support programmes run through Ademe (the demonstrator component in particular), BPI France,
the Caisse des dépôts et consignations (CDC) and the National Research Agency (Institute for the
energy transition, calls for generic projects).  Dedicated calls for projects can also speed up
development and innovation through a specific package for project holders. Large, ambitious
breakthrough innovation projects could also be funded, as a complement, at national level (with
the Innovation and Industry Fund) or European level.
B. Strategy
The guidelines given below are detailed for the energy sector in the National Energy Research
Strategy (Stratégie Nationale de Recherche Énergétique, SNRE)
a) Guideline R&I: develop low carbon innovations using basic and
applied research and facilitate their rapid dissemination
 Foster the emergence of innovative companies developing breakthrough innovations and
facilitate the adoption and dissemination of such innovations:
◦ Encourage experimentation with low carbon innovations and increase support for
demonstrators.   Monitor   the   key   environmental   impacts   of   these   experiments
(biodiversity, air quality, technological risks etc.).
◦ Bring different R&D approaches together by fostering interdisciplinarity: interactions
between users, entrepreneurs and researchers, including through feedback on
experience and participative sciences, to foster the development of new innovations
and the continued improvement of technologies needed to achieve the climate goals.
◦ Take social expectations and obstacles into account using sociological studies, in order
to direct research and thus facilitate the adoption of innovations in civil society.
◦ Support the organisations that can play a role in catalysing innovation.
◦ Support the industrial phase of technology development: make it possible to fund infant
industries and R&D industries, redirect financial flows towards these industries, support
start-up indicators and innovation within the social and cohesive economy etc.
◦ Offer specific training for professionals on implementing the innovations emerging on
the market (maintaining and developing the skills required to install and maintain the
technology)
◦ Publish information about the innovations to inform consumers who may encounter
them (use, advantages, drawbacks, etc.)
◦ Develop tools to estimate the emissions avoided through these emerging technologies
(for non-energy emissions).
◦ Encourage adoption of the innovations through a price signal corresponding to
emissions avoided.
 Develop basic and applied research:
◦ Take a long-term view of the research direction in line with the public policies on climate
and energy.
◦ Increase public funding for R&D and calls for projects targeting the key levers of the
transition (decarbonisation of energy sectors, energy efficiency, sinks and technologies
to store and use carbon).
◦ Encourage collaboration between the actors in research, business and associations, by
also   strengthening   European   and   international   cooperation   and   facilitating   the
coordination of these projects whilst encouraging the actors to take multi-sector
aspects into account. Promote the low carbon transition in European and international
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 62/176research programmes.
◦ Offer regularly updated technological road maps that respond to the key levers of the
national low carbon strategy and ensure their visibility.
◦ Carry out consumer research to gather precise information on consumer habits and the
public instruments that could steer these habits towards low carbon consumption.
◦ Undertake research on the environmental impacts of the low carbon processes
implemented, at project and channel scale. Propose measures to avoid and reduce
these impacts.
◦ Conduct prospective studies of changes in the channels, including new channels,
taking the deployment of low carbon innovations into account.
◦ Provide a clear long-term view of carbon pricing (cf. guidelines in chapter 4.2.ii
“Economic policy”) to foster further R&D development, especially in the private sector,
in favour of the low carbon transition.
b) Areas of concern
 Consolidate the development of competitive French channels for the low carbon economy.
 Plan for an analysis of environmental and social issues linked to the development of low
carbon processes, and improve our knowledge on bio-based materials in particular.
C. Monitoring and indicators
a) Main indicators of the guideline R&I
 Number of patent applications linked to the policy of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions
 Public expenditure on research and development monitored in the budget document
annexed to the budget bill on "financing the ecological transition".
iv. Urban planning and development
A.Overview and challenges
National and regional urban planning and development policies are critical in terms of greenhouse
gas emissions. Their effects are felt in the very long term, since the structure of urban planning is
difficult and slow to reverse. Land take needs to be limited now, especially those with the largest
carbon stocks, such as wetlands. Indeed, if the current rate of land take continues, the percentage
of artificialised land, currently at 10%, will rise to 14% in 2050 and 20% in 2100. Indeed, we
observe that the newly artificialised land areas - of which nearly half are for residential use – are
progressing faster than the population and housing stock at the national level56.
Beyond this issue, urban shapes are becoming increasingly sprawling with a strong impact on
greenhouse gas emissions. The remoteness of housing from employment and commercial areas
leads, among other things, to an increase in the demand for transport, and therefore for energy
and the use of individual vehicles, whereas achieving carbon neutrality implies, on the other hand,
increased efforts in terms of efficiency and energy saving.
Soil conservation is of crucial importance since it is a resource that regenerates very slowly but is
vital for carbon storage and the development of bio-based productions. Diffuse land take and the
degradation of soils rich in organic matter, particularly peat bogs and mangroves, are in fact
continuing to the detriment of these potentials. Land take is also a climate change vulnerability
56 Artificialisation, De la mesure à l’action, CGDD, Thema, January 2017 –  using the Teruti-Lucas database
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 63/176factor.
Local authorities thus play a key role in the regional implementation of the national low carbon
strategy, notably through regional planning documents57 and project development. The range of
existing tools already allows communities to impose rules that promote sustainable and
economical projects in space management.
It is therefore a question of strengthening the carbon stock (forests and soils), developing carbon-
efficient urban forms and ensuring the supply of renewable resources. Soil conservation is
accompanied by numerous environmental co-benefits (biodiversity, territorial resilience to climate
change, water quantity and quality, risk prevention, living environment and public health).
B.Strategy
Land take is a high-stake issue for attaining carbon neutrality. While the medium-term objective is
to continue to develop within the existing urban envelope58  without consuming new natural,
agricultural and forest areas, the long-term objective is to stop the net land take. The work
launched as part of the implementation of action 10 of the Government's biodiversity plan59 will
make it possible to define the time scale for achieving the "zero net land take" objective and the
means proposed to communities to achieve it.  The results will be incorporated into the next review
of the SNBC.
a) Guideline   URB:   Containing   land   take  and   reducing   carbon
emissions caused by urbanisation
 Make the existing urban framework60 more dynamic by strengthening urban hubs and rural
villages, and revitalising areas that have lost their attraction. Develop regional cooperation.
 Develop highly dense urban forms structured around transport routes, services, businesses
and jobs. Encourage different functions on a same plot of land to avoid urban sprawling.
Encourage households, businesses and artisans to move back into town centres.
Encourage the reselling of empty buildings and bring them up to standard to limit new
construction. Implement strong property policies to manage property prices and preserve
diversified uses.
 Optimize land use by industrial spaces, transport infrastructures and large infrastructures
(logistics, ports, airports etc.) that cannot be located in urban areas, and diversify their
uses. Promote shops in city centres before developing shops on the outskirts and optimise
the footprint of existing large commercial activity zones located outside city centres in line
with Action 12 of the biodiversity plan to modernise the regulatory framework and
governance relating to commercial development. Incorporate measures in the planning
documents encouraging the development of renewable energy, particularly in areas where
their impact on the landscape, soil quality, the functioning of the ecosystems and
biodiversity is limited.
 Stop the urban sprawl and degradation of agricultural, natural and forest areas and
encourage mixed uses: tourism, leisure, production, water regulation and purification,
preservation of biodiversity, etc. Limit or even stop the wetlands drying up. Promote the
inclusion of the preservation of soil ecosystem services in SRADDETs (regional schems for
land-use planning, sustainable development and equality of territories), including carbon
storage, by integrating them into the goals of preserving ecological continuity.
57 In among others: the regional schemes for sustainable development and territorial equality, the territorial climate-air-
energy plans, the “schemes of territorial coherence”, the local urban planning schemes, the urban transport plans, the
local residential plans, regional biomass schemes, and forestry and timber regional programmes.

60 Classification of towns and their areas of influence.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 64/176 In connection with the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (PNACC)61: promote
urban forms that are resilient to the effects of climate change: reducing urban heat islands,
limiting soil sealing and rainwater runoff, limiting the effects of extreme weather events,
etc.; disseminate knowledge and feedback on nature-based solutions.
 Limit excavation and soil sealing for urbanisation needs and promote the preservation of
the open land.
 Encourage companies to develop in their CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) report a
chapter on the economy of artificial and waterproofed soil surfaces.
b) Areas of concern
 Urban intensity62 can lead to a feeling of overpopulation and can cause environmental
impacts (noise, air quality degradation, transport congestion, etc.). It must therefore be
supported by research on improving the living environment and quality architectural design
(quality   landscaped  green  spaces,   innovation   in  housing  design,   maintenance  of
biodiversity, etc.).
 Limiting land take can boost property and land prices in attractive areas where services are
concentrated. The risk is then that poorer households are forced to move to the urban
fringes with bad public transport links or to areas more exposed to environmental impacts.
Urban intensification should thus be accompanied by policies that foster social diversity.
C. Monitoring and indicators

A.Overview and challenges
The low carbon transition requires French people to significantly change their ways of living and
consuming in the medium and long term, particularly in terms of travel and consumption of goods
and services, including food. These changes must take place in a society with different values; a
shift in posture must take place, which will make other lifestyles acceptable or even desirable.
These challenges are key points of France's roadmap for the implementation of Agenda 2030
adopted in September 2019.
During the public consultation prior to the revision of the strategy (https://www.ecologique-
solidaire.gouv.fr/revision-strategie-nationale-bas-carbone-contributions-des-citoyens),
respondents expressed high expectations for results and a need to be able to trust the low carbon
solutions on offer.
B.Strategy
Sobriety has a high potential for reducing emissions. The strategy promotes sobriety in individual
and collective behaviour (change in social norms) mainly through informing and educating citizens,
and raising their awareness. Regulation of the supply chain and clear price signals could also

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 65/176steer consumers towards low carbon consumption.
a) Guideline CIT 1: expand and share a “low carbon” culture
 Foster a "low carbon" culture by mobilising communication to highlight the many services
provided by the low carbon transition (co-benefits: justice, economy, jobs, health,
environment, etc.) and the risks generated if this transition is not implemented:
◦ by incorporating sustainable development issues, especially those linked to climate
change, the energy transition and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, in
primary and secondary school curricula and in higher education, initial and further
professional training, educational projects and in the production of educational
resources.
◦ Make this culture accessible to all and promote low carbon ways of life (food, avoiding
waste, local channels, bio-based products, new uses and services for mobility and
housing, sober use of air-conditioning etc.) through extra-curricular and out-of-school
activities, public media, the social network pages of public actors, regulation of
advertising   messages   for   high   greenhouse-gas-emitting   products   and   services
(transport, consumer goods generating emissions such as electrical devices, etc.)
and/or adverts inciting waste production and over-consumption of resources (cf. Road
map for a circular economy63).
◦ Launch awareness campaigns that highlight the health and environmental co-benefits
of low carbon policies, especially in terms of food, air pollution and the sustainability of
certain consumer goods.
◦ Take advantage of the momentum generated by the publication of successive IPCC
reports to communicate  the new results in climate research in order to raise citizen
awareness of climate change issues.
 Reinforce the exemplarity of all public institutions, in particular by developing management
systems for energy, human resources policies and mobility plans.
 Encourage young people to participate in low carbon activities: eco-delegates, elected high
school students, civic service, universal national service, youth movements, student
associations.
 Organize national and regional days on the themes of climate and energy, allowing each
institution (local authority, company, association, NGO, museum etc.) to take ownership of
the theme and organize their own events.
 Develop regional actions encouraging citizen participation (“positive energy families”,
participative workshops, etc.).
b) Guideline   CIT   2:   assist   citizens   in   their   own   low   carbon
transition
 Develop and disseminate tools (particularly digital) that enable citizens to calculate their
own impact on the climate, and that propose personalised emissions reduction actions
tailored to individual lifestyles.
 Provide consumers with a reliable means of choosing more sustainable products and
services, by developing information tools (including carbon footprint calculation tools) and
improving the dissemination of existing tools, such as labels for goods and services
(ensuring these labels are also visible on online purchasing platforms), and reliable
information (efficiency, reliability, profitability, sustainability, etc.) verified by a trustworthy
third party. The carbon pricing policy (cf. chapter 4.1.ii. “Economic policy”) also contributes
to encouraging consumers to prioritize low-carbon options,  namely when used in
conjunction with grants for the acquisition of property and the installation of high

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 66/176performance solutions (vehicles, housing) which could be funded by income from carbon
pricing.
 Offer educational projects on controlling greenhouse gas emissions linked to consumption
(including raising awareness of eco-driving and more general driving skills in the transport
domain), as well as on “calculating carbon footprints” in secondary schools, universities
and apprentice training centres.
 Communicate more/better with citizens about their ability to accelerate the implementation
of a low carbon economy, through their consumer choices, which condition the production
and import of products.
 Encourage citizens to consume in a more circular way (see Circular Economy Roadmap
and strategic chapter 4.3.vii Waste), including by promoting reuse and repair, rather than
throwing away to buy again.
 Increase young people’s awareness of the low-carbon transition during the cohesion phase
of universal national service (eco-citizenship, responsible consumption, circular economy,
food, health-environment link).
c) Guideline CIT 3: make sure that the public policy measures
which stem from the SNBC are socially accep
 Build on sociological studies when setting out the public policies.
 Increase actions encouraging public participation in implementing public policies, action
plans and regional projects supporting a low carbon economy.
 Take into account the impact on households (especially the smallest ones) of measures
associated with the low-carbon transition. Favour, as far as possible, socially just and
redistributive measures (see ECO 5 Guideline).
C. Monitoring and indicators
a) Main indicators of guideline CIT 1

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 67/176vi. Employment, skills, qualifications and occupational training
A.Overview and challenges
The ecological transition is an opportunity for the economy and for employment (cf. chapter 2.1,
paragraph E. Transition support, creation of sustainable wealth and employment). The two
constituent elements of the Climate Plan (ambition and solidarity) are part of the same virtuous
logic of green growth: enriching skills, raising qualification levels, encouraging new career paths
and new bridges between professions; all strategic factors.
Today,   several   tools   and   support   actions   exist   to  promote  professional  transitions  and
reconversions linked to the energy and climate transition, such as:
 the "employment and skills programming plan" (PPEC)65, which takes into account the
guidelines set by the Multi-Annual Energy Plan for continental metropolitan France (cf.
energy transition for green growth act of 17 August 2015). This PPEC concerns only the
energy sectors;
 the   Regional   Economic   Development,   Innovation   and   Internationalisation   Scheme
(SRDEII) sets out the Regions' strategic economic guidelines;
 CTEs (ecological transition contracts), which set out with environmental, economic and
social issues in a global approach by involving local authorities and companies in a given
area;
 The trials, notably at regional level, such as the deployment in four regions of France of the
Methodological kit to support professional transitions in sectors impacted by the energy
and ecology transition, to develop career path potential66;
 Introduce GPEC approaches (GPEC: Forward planning of employment and skills plans).
For this reason, support is given to the prospective skills actions of the occupational fields
through the Skills Investment Plan;
 as part of the Skills Investment Plan (PIC), the co-financing by Pôle emploi (the French
public employment service) of 10,000 training courses for jobs in the ecological transition.
B. Strategy
a) Guideline   PRO   1:   Encourage   better   integration   of   the   low
carbon transition challenges by industrial sectors, businesses
and territories in order to facilitate occupational transitions and
conversions and developing future employment.
 Develop, at both national and territorial levels, tools for analysing changes in jobs and skills
linked to the energy and climate transition, as well as support and adaptation actions to
bring stakeholders together, such as the employment and skills programming plan, eco-
transition contracts, experiments and GPEC (Forward planning of employment and skills
plans) actions (see previous paragraph).
 Support a renewal of the skills needed for energy and climate transition in all sectors of
activity, notably in the economic channels most affected by the low carbon transition in their
“core profession”, particularly:
◦ the  building  sector   should continue  to  boost   skills  and coordination  between
professions, particularly in SMEs and VSEs (artisanal and project management), to
greatly increase the amount of high performance renovations and constructions in
environmental and quality terms, and the amount of wooden, bio-based and bioclimatic
65 See the report of Laurence Parisot's preparation mission, February 2019, available here:
https://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/rapport_parisot_ppec_200219.pdf
66 In 2019, the study-action on the wood sector conducted in the Auvergne Rhône-Alpes region made it possible to give better
visibility to the jobs in this sector in the employment areas where it is present, particularly among those involved in vocational
guidance and integration, and to implement actions such as the introduction of work-linked training.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 68/176buildings67. (cf. chapters 4.2.ii. “Building sector” and 4.2.iv. “Forest/wood”).
◦ The channels linked to the development of the bioeconomy (agricultural channel,
forest/wood channel) face the challenge of supporting the spread of green skills and
the development of new professions, in the context of adapting to climate change,
respecting biodiversity and contributing to the green economy (producing renewable
energies, bio-based materials etc.) (cf. chapters 4.2.iii. “Agriculture” and 4.2.iv.
“Forestry/Wood”).
◦ The mobility sector is also undergoing a transition both professionally and economically,
in line with the development of shared transport and low carbon vehicles and the
changes in the associated infrastructures.
◦ The energy production channels (cf. Multi-Annual Energy Plan in mainland France and
the Skills and Employment Programming Plan).
b) Guideline PRO 2: Adapting formal education and continuing
education systems in order to support the transformation of
activities and territories
 Initiate and inform a revision of professional diplomas and certificates, with the objective of
better incorporating the changing skills requirements in teaching programmes (including in
agricultural and forestry teaching), as well as in the range of further professional training
programmes available (including training for elected officials), so that the skills available
match the requirements of the businesses and regional authorities involved and the
requirements of the ecology and climate transition.
 To enable the preceding point, provide a skills base to teachers and trainers to allow them
to integrate low carbon transition issues in their teaching.
 Undertake specific actions for the voluntary sectors, such as setting up a certification of
energy contact points in industry and their registration in the National Directory of
Professional Certifications (NDPC).
c) Area of concern
 Particular attention should be paid to increasing the skills base in the building sector (new
construction and energy renovation) through the development and adaptation of the
training programmes on offer.
C. Monitoring and indicators
a) Main indicators of guideline PRO 1
 Number of energy transition contracts including “employment and skills” items.
 Number of training programmes taken by workers in the building energy renovation sector.

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 69/1764.3. Sectoral Guidelines
i. Transport
A.Overview and challenges
The transport sector emitted 139 Mt CO eq in 2017, excluding international bunkers68 (the French
2
share of international bunkers was 23 MtCO ), i.e. 30% of national emissions (35% including
2
international bunkers). These emissions increased by 11.8% between 1990 and 2017, with a sharp
rise noted between 1990 and 2004 (+18.9%).
In the French Overseas Territories, transport accounts for nearly 39% of emissions. It is the
leading emitting sector, in equal part with energy conversion, due to the low development of public
transport and the relatively large share of air transport in these territories.
For transport, the final energy consumption in 2017 was 46 Mtep (53 Mtep when including
international air and sea bunkers) of which 90.4% was from fossil fuels.
The main gas emitted by the transport sector is carbon dioxide (CO ) from fuel combustion: it
2
represented 96.4% of greenhouse gas emissions in 2017, followed by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
(2.4% of emissions) and other greenhouse gases (1.2% of emissions) such as nitrous oxide and
methane.

adjusted for climatic variations. Emissions excluding international bunkers.
When compared to the emissions reduction targets set in the first national low carbon strategy, we
can see that emissions from the sector were slightly higher than the targets set, exceeding the
2015-2018 indicative annual limit in the carbon budget69  (cf. chapter 3.2. 2015-2018 carbon
budget balance). This delay can be explained by the low energy prices in recent years, lower-than-
expected fuel efficiency gains for new vehicles, the gap between theoretical vehicle emissions and
actual emissions, the recovery of economic activity, and the gap with regard to the ambition in
terms of modal shift.
The scale of the issues at stake implies a rapid change of scale in collective action, as highlighted
68 International bunkers represent international air and sea transport arriving in or departing from France, but do not include transport
between mainland France and the French Overseas Territories, which is considered as domestic transport.
69 Carbon budget provisionally adjusted in 2019 following the changes in greenhouse gas emissions accounting and in conformity
with the implementing decree no. 2015-1491 of 18 November 2015 relative to national carbon budgets and the national low carbon
strategy. This will be definitively adjusted in spring 2020.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 70/176by the work of the Assises nationales de la mobilité and the Assises nationales du transport
aérien, as well as simultaneous consideration of air quality.
B.Strategy
The strategy aims to reduce the sector's emissions by 28% by 2030 compared to 2015.
The goal of carbon neutrality requires major ambition in terms of reducing the sector’s energy
demand and increased efforts in energy efficiency.
It implies a total decarbonisation70 of the land, river and (domestic) maritime transport sectors,
either by switching to low-emitting (in life cycle) electric engines or by switching to carbon-free
alternative fuels (in life cycle analysis). A complete transformation of the vehicle fleet is therefore
necessary,   as   is   the   development   of   electric   charging   and   renewable   gas   distribution
infrastructures (biogas, hydrogen etc.). However, these two projects are only one part of the
transition of the sector. Indeed, to limit the impacts on demand for carbon-free energy, very
substantial progress in energy efficiency and sobriety is also needed.
Past and projected emissions in the transport sector between 1990 and 2050 (in MtCO eq)
2
e: estimation. Sources: CITEPA inventory of April 2018 in SECTEN format and within the scope of the Kyoto
Climate Plan; 2018 scenarios "With Existing Measures" and "With Additional Measures".
It is therefore imperative to jointly pull the following five key levers:
 decarbonize the energy consumed by vehicles and adapt the associated infrastructures;
 improving the energy performance of vehicles;
 control of demand growth (for passenger and freight transport);
 modal shift (for passenger and freight transport) towards the most energy-efficient and low-
emitting modes;
70 Does not take into account "incompressible" residual gas leaks (fluorinated gases, renewable gases).
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 71/176 optimize vehicle use (for passenger and freight transport).
The changes in the sector in terms of demand for mobility, modal choices and renewal and
conversion of vehicle fleets are guided by: the introduction of price signal incentives and regional
urban planning and development policies (cf. chapter 4.1.iv. “Urban planning, development and
regional dynamics”), the effectiveness of European and national regulations on air quality and
vehicles, increased consumer expectations, controlling growth in demand for mobility, policies
supporting alternative, active and collective means of transport, and the development of alternative
channels (aimed at networks, infrastructures and vehicles) and policies helping businesses to
implement ambitious initiatives, along with measures to manage traffic at regional level and
policies supporting new types of mobility.
All these levers should be pulled simultaneously by combining them in the most effective way
possible: for land and river transport, the strategic documents on clean mobility will take account of
all these requirements and detail the changes necessary in the development of very low and zero
emissions vehicles and in the deployment of refuelling infrastructures, improving fleet energy
efficiency by taking account of the specific performance of each engine, the modal shift for freight
and passengers, development of collective and collaborative modes of transport, including car
sharing and carpooling, increasing the load rate of freight vehicles and controlling the increase in
transport demand for both freight and passengers.
For domestic maritime transport, in addition to energy efficiency gains, carbon neutrality must be
targeted by allowing refuelling with low carbon fuels in all French ports and facilitating conversion
to other low carbon technologies (batteries, biofuels, hydrogen, sailing, etc.).
Partial decarbonisation of air transport will require substantial gains in energy efficiency through
R&D, as well as the widespread introduction of highly decarbonised alternative fuels (50% biofuels
in 2050 in the modelled scenario). We also need to continue R&D efforts to have aircraft that
operate without hydrocarbons, such as hydrogen or electric aircraft. Other alternative fuels, such
as synthetic kerosene, could be used if their environmental and energy balance proves relevant.
a) Guideline T 1: provide the sector with incentive price signals
 Find a way to gradually standardise intra-European competition in road transport, in order
to standardise fuel tax rates at European level or within a group of neighbouring Member
States, particularly for professional road transport, in line with the objectives of greening
fleets and with public policy objectives (e.g. for public transport).
 Enable the internalisation of the external costs of road use (climatic, environmental, health
and use) and charge a fair price for road modes, both over long distances and in urban
areas.
 For air transport, support a significant increase in the share of alternative fuels that are
highly decarbonated (in life cycle analysis) and convincing in terms of their overall
environmental and energy balance by relying on second-generation biofuels or even
synthetic kerosene, support R&D to improve energy efficiency and to develop alternatives
to hydrocarbons (hydrogen and electric aircraft), and act in European and international
bodies to strengthen existing fiscal and market instruments (ETS, CORSIA, ticket taxes), or
even replace them with new ones (kerosene taxation), in order to accelerate the
decarbonisation of air transport, seeking convergence with national energy taxation.
b) Guideline T 2: set clear and coherent goals with targeted
objectives for the energy transition of fleets.
 Set ambitious energy efficiency targets at national level and take these to the European
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 72/176level, in order to decrease pressure on carbon-free resources created by the carbon
neutrality goal. These objectives should:
◦ for cars, aim for an actual consumption level of:
▪ Approximately 4 l/100 km for new thermal vehicles sold after 203071;
▪ 12.5 kWh/100 km for new electric vehicles by 2050;
◦ for heavy goods vehicles, aim for a consumption in 2040 of:
▪ 21 l/100 km for new vehicles running on diesel;
▪ 15 kg/100 km for new vehicles running on natural gas for vehicles (NGV);
▪ 129 kWh/100 km for vehicles running on electricity.
 Support changes in actual fleet energy efficiency by improving vehicle use through an
awareness campaign for all citizens and professionals about eco-driving.
 Set ambitious decarbonisation goals for vehicles, including two-wheeled vehicles (in
gCO /km rather than gCO /kWh) and public health objectives, by prioritising a life cycle
2 2
approach, incorporating the various environmental criteria (pollution, resources etc.).
◦ At the same time, guarantee the continuity of these strategic directions by giving a clear
view, over as long a time frame as possible, of the resulting public policies, while taking
into   account   the   inherent   uncertainties,   coherence   with   European   guidelines,
technological developments and technological risks over the long term.
◦ Take the vehicles with the highest impact on atmospheric pollution out of circulation
through appropriate measures, including low emissions zones.
 Monitor the equilibrium of the standards and fleets so as to avoid any adverse effects of
vehicle substitution, such the substitution of goods transport for light commercial vehicles
(LCV)   or   the  development   of   “rapid  delivery”   when  these  new  vectors  are  not
decarbonised.
 Establish a pathway for renewing the fleet which is consistent with carbon neutrality and,
for light vehicles, with the objective of ending sales of new light vehicles using fossil fuels in
2040, in line with the mobility guidance law. To meet this objective, the main technologies
available are electric vehicles, which by 2040 will be at a highly advanced stage, and
hydrogen, for which deployment prospects for 2040 will have to be analysed in more detail,
but which remains an interesting solution to run alongside electric vehicles. As a reminder,
the baseline scenario targets 35% sales of new electric passenger cars and 10% sales of
plug-in hybrids in 2030 and 100% sales of new electric passenger cars in 2040.
c) Guideline T 3: support fleet changes for all modes of transport
 Support vehicle renewal to accelerate the energy transition, while taking the economic
impacts of this into account and paying particular attention to the most precarious and
geographically isolated members of the population.
 Through legislative and regulatory measures and investments, facilitate the deployment of
a permanent network of recharging facilities that is open to the public and spread evenly
across the whole of the country (proximity network) and higher power recharges on the
major roads and junctions. This network must be sustainable so as to avoid slowing the
development of electromobility72.
 Facilitate recharging at home and at work, particularly by supporting the deployment of
recharging facilities in collective housing through legislative and regulatory measures and
financial aid.
71 This objective covers a wide range of circumstances, including the rapid development of electric vehicles that consume no fuel at
all.
72
 Within the framework of the national strategy for the development of clean mobility and acted by the Working Group on anaerobic 
digestion chaired by Sébastien Lecornu (February-March 2018).
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 73/176 Define transition trajectories for maritime and river fleets by type of fleet (commercial,
pleasure craft, fishing, government, etc.) with the sectors, aiming in particular for total
decarbonisation of domestic journeys by 2050.
 Develop the infrastructures, including ports and airports, serving other fuel alternatives, by
facilitating - for example for gas - connections to NGV refuelling infrastructures in the
transport network or by supporting bio-NGV not injected into the network when this is
produced in regions far from the network infrastructure73.
 Set ambitious targets for greening the public vehicle fleet and some private fleets, including
at a European scale.
 Continue efforts in research, innovation and development (cf. chapter 4.1.iii. “Research and
Innovation Policy”) on knowledge of fleets and technologies, as well as on the instruments
used and the environmental impacts of these technologies.
d) Guideline T 4: support local authorities and businesses to
implement innovative initiatives
 Progressively deploy low emissions zones or congestion charges, as a priority in the
French agglomerations that are the most exposed to pollution. Encourage these
agglomerations to set up incentives for using clean and shared modes (with for example
routes, access zones, timetables and reserved parking depending on the vehicles).
 Make it easier for regions to participate in the clean mobility policy by introducing
appropriate coordination tools and by encouraging the most innovative initiatives (see also
guidelines in chapter 4.1.iv. “Urban planning, development and regional dynamics”).
 Encourage companies to draw up action plans to reduce their emissions and renew their
fleets, through for example reinforcing staff mobility plans, increasing the participation of
companies and user representatives in transport policy decision-making on a regional
scale and strengthening the fiscal tools and advantages for sustainable commuting.
e) Guideline T 5: encourage the modal shift by supporting active
transport   and   public   and   mass   transit   (for   freight   and
passengers), and by developing transport intermodality.
 Supporting active modes Set an ambitious trajectory for the development of bicycle use
that is consistent with the objectives of the 2018 cycling plan: increasing the modal share
(in number of short-distance trips) from 3% to 12% by 2030 and to 15% by 2050.
Implement a package of actions that contribute to meeting these objectives: developing
secure cycle parks, creating bike paths, supporting the use of bicycles, constructing
pedestrian and cycle spaces during renovation and/or extension work on roads.
 Support the development of public transport: for daily journeys, increase the range of public
transport options in the urban, interurban and rail transport networks (transilien, TER,
RER); for long-distance rail options the emphasis should be put on improving network
performance, particularly with a view to encouraging a modal shift from air to rail. As a
reminder, the baseline scenario aims to increase the modal share of public transport by 7
points between 2015 and 2050.
 To effectively and sustainably reduce freight emissions, encourage a more pronounced
modal shift for goods transport and boost the competitiveness of rail freight (install rail
motorways), boost the competitiveness of river transport, encourage a shift towards
alternatives to road use (aide à la pince), develop the competitiveness and attractiveness
73 In the context of the Clean Transport Development Strategy, accepted by the anaerobic digestion work group presided by
Sébastien Lecornu (February-March 2018).
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 74/176of port and maritime sectors, make modes of transport and networks more green, optimize
the weight and volume of loads, promote research and innovation and help urban transport
flow more freely and cleanly.
f) Guideline T 6: Manage increased demand for transport
 Encourage new ways of working:
◦ particularly with ambitious objectives for teleworking (for example: 50% of French
teleworkers work at home on average 20% of the time, that is 10% of home-worked
hours on the national scale);
◦ by introducing measures that support the development of third places, including shared
work spaces and on-site services for workers.
 Support the rise in car sharing and other shared mobility services (carpooling etc.) over
short distances and in zones not covered by public transport and develop tools and
infrastructures that facilitate shared mobility: for example, invest in multimodal exchange
hubs facilitating public transport and new types of mobility.
 Support the circular economy and short supply circuits so as to uncouple growth in traffic
and freight from GDP.
 For all new infrastructure projects, take the impact of traffic generated into account in public
decision-making in order to achieve a “carbon audit” (construction/use/maintenance) that is
coherent with the climate policies.
 See also the guidelines in chapter 4.1.iv. “Urban planning, development and regional
dynamics”.
 As a reminder, in 2050, the baseline scenario targets a growth in passenger traffic by all
modes combined limited to 26% (in passenger-km), i.e. 4 points less than the business-as-
usual scenario, and a growth in freight traffic limited to 40% (in tonne-km), i.e. half as much
as the business-as-usual scenario predicts in relation to 2015.
g) Areas of concern
 It takes a long time for change to occur (renewing of fleets, infrastructures etc.) particularly
for some types of fleet (for example, ships, rubbish trucks, buses etc.) and this means
decisions should be forward-looking to manage the costs, the economic opportunities and
consequences, and the technological risks (notably, the development of electromobility:
issues of supplying raw materials, location of resources, anticipation of impacts on the
trade balance and the employment market).
 The ambition for the transport sector is rising, although the initial results fall below the
expectations of the first national low carbon strategy.
 Some technological innovations, such as the development of self-driving cars, could result
in breakthroughs that lead us to reexamine the expected progression of the sector in the
baseline scenario on which this strategy is based (cf. chapter 2.2. “The baseline scenario”).
 Large-scale transformation in the transport sector would have an impact on resources,
biodiversity and even landscapes.
 Supporting households and businesses, particularly the most vulnerable, is a condition for
success of the transition of modes of transport and vehicle fleets.

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 76/176ii. Building sector
A.Overview and challenges
The residential/tertiary sector emitted 90 Mt CO eq in 2017, that is 19% of national emissions
2
(scope 1), and 28% when including emissions from the production of energy consumed in
buildings (scope 2)74. These emissions decreased slightly between 1990 and 2017 (-3.1% over the
period) as a result of a decrease in residential emissions of about -14%, while those of the tertiary
sector increased by +19% over the period (with nevertheless a decrease observed since 2015). In
recent years, final energy consumption has been stagnating (+0.4% between 2014 and 201775) for
all residential and tertiary sectors. The 2017 energy mix for the residential/tertiary sector is made
up of 39.2% electricity, 29.2% natural gas, 12.7% oil products, 15.2% renewable thermal and
waste energy, 3.4% heat from a heating network and 0.1% coal.
Carbon dioxide (CO ) is the main gas emitted by the residential/tertiary sector: it represented
2
84.0% of greenhouse gas emissions in 2017, followed by HFCs (11.4% of emissions), methane
(CH  – 3,7% of emissions) and other greenhouse gases (N O, SF , PFC, representing 0.9% of
4 2 6
emissions).

adjusted for climatic variations, only the building use phase.
Compared to the emission reduction targets, the residential/tertiary sector is lagging behind in the
short term, with, according to a provisional balance sheet, overruns of the indicative 2015 to 2018
annual shares of the carbon budget 76(cf. chapter 3.2. “Balance of the carbon budget 2015-2018”)
and a real risk of not meeting the national and European targets to 2030 if the trajectory is not
quickly reversed.
This delay can be explained in particular by a significant discrepancy between the rate and energy
performance of these renovations and the scenario forecast in the strategy adopted in 2015.
This means we must accelerate the emissions reductions in the short term, and do so in a general
context where the carbon neutrality goal set in 2017 induces an increase in the rate and intensity
of the goals set by the first SNBC.
74 These figures do not include the emissions from building/demolishing buildings.

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 77/176Sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the residential-tertiary sector
Note: the emissions linked to construction and renovation works are accounted for in the industry sector
The sector’s particularities are:
 the economic and financial size of the energy transition work. For this sector alone, in
the short term, the energy renovation plan for buildings - using the totals of the large
investment plan - requires around 20 billion euros of public support over the five-year
presidency (14 in investments and premiums, complemented by over 5 billion euros in
energy saving certificates77). Over the long term, total investment needs (public + private)
have been estimated over the next three decades to fall within a range of between 15 and
30 billion euros per year, the upper end of the range being reached during the 2040-2050
decade (cf. chapter 4.ii. “Economic policy”). This cost could be increased if a significant
share of the renovations is performed in stages, as is currently the case. As regards this
range, the current investment stands at €21B78. As the chronicle of investment needs is
calibrated  on  the  basis  of   the  renovations  observed,   current   expenditure  is,   by
construction, close to the need calculated at the beginning of the chronicle. However, the
need for investment will grow fairly rapidly as the pace of renovations is expected to
accelerate;
 High inertia: in 2050, 70% of stock could be made up of buildings built before 2012.79
Renovating this part of the building stock is essential to lower energy consumption during
the use phase. Indeed, due to the size of the works to be done, a gradual rise in renovation
projects is required with very high incentive prices. This effort should also cover the sectors
of construction materials, industry, forestry and agriculture;
 The impacts in terms of greenhouse gas emissions in the construction and demolition
phases should be better controlled80. In 2050, in life cycle analysis, the construction and
demolition phases of buildings could be responsible for a large share of the emissions of
the building sector in a broad sense, even if they are also reduced. Managing these
emissions both upstream and downstream is thus also a key issue.
France's energy renovation policy is defined in the short term by the Energy Renovation Plan for

80 These impacts mostly come from the industry sector which includes construction in terms of this strategy.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 78/176Buildings, whose objective of combating fuel poverty has been translated into actions within the
energy-climate law of 2019. This makes energy renovation a national priority and sets the short-
term priority lines of action in order to: increase and improve renovation; increase aid to support all
households in renovation work; make public buildings exemplary in terms of energy efficiency (-
15% in 5 years) and involve the territories by mobilising local players.
B. Strategy
The strategy aims to achieve the following objectives:
 Reduce emissions by 49% by 2030 compared to 2015;
 Total decarbonisation81 of the sector by 2050 to enable France to become carbon neutral.
For the building sector, this implies:
◦ Highly ambitious efforts in terms of energy efficiency, with a strong improvement in the
performance of the envelope and equipment, as well as increased reliance on sobriety;
◦ Drastically reducing energy consumption in the sector;
◦ Relying exclusively on carbon-free energy sources (cf. chapter 4.2 on energy);
◦ Maximising production of the carbon-free energy types that are best adapted to each
building type
◦ Greater reliance on less carbonised construction materials and on equipment with
superior energy and environmental performance, such as in some cases those that are
bio-based or from the circular economy, through performance targets set for the carbon
footprint of buildings throughout their life cycle, including both renovation and
construction.82
Past and projected emissions in the building sector between 1990 and 2050 (in MtCO eq)

AME and AMS 2018 Scenario
81 Does not take into account "incompressible" residual gas leaks (fluorinated gases, renewable gases).
82 A “bio-based building” label is currently being revised by the government for new builds and renovations, which will set a trend and
give a boost to the most efficient materials from an environmental point of view.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 79/176This requires an immediate net acceleration in the rate of energy transition in the sector through
changes in the rules and incentives covering renovation and construction.
The first step is a radical thermal renovation of the existing stock, to arrive at a level in line
with Low Consumption Building standards (BBC in French) across the whole stock by 2050, with
ambitious thermal and energy requirements as well as strict greenhouse gas emissions criteria.
This implies the gradual acceleration of the pace of renovation in the residential and tertiary
sectors to reach, in particular, 500,00083 housing renovations per year over the current five-year
period.
In the longer term, a change in both the number and performance of renovations is necessary. In
particular, in the residential sector, this rate should reach at least 370,000 equivalent complete
renovations84 by the end of the five-year period and 700,000 equivalent complete renovations on
average per year from 2030 onwards.  In accordance with the Climate Plan, the acceleration of the
pace of renovation should also make it possible to eradicate fuel poverty ("thermal sieves") by 1st
January, 2028, as well as a thorough renovation of the public housing stock, particularly in
administrative housing estates.
For this sector, staff training and changes in businesses are crucial points (cf. chapter 4.1.vi.
“Employment, skills, qualifications and occupational training”). This also applies to the mobilisation
of funds.
The reduction of the overall consumption of buildings can also be achieved by increasing energy
and climate performance in new buildings.
Strengthening the energy and climate performance of new buildings and renovations is also
important in the overseas territories. Ninety percent of electricity demand comes from this sector
and demand for air conditioning is responsible for a large share of electricity consumption. It is all
the more important because the decarbonisation of vehicles and industry will increase the demand
for electricity in areas where the energy mix currently relies heavily on carbon. Moreover, leaks of
fluorinated gases (HFCs) from air conditioning systems also contribute to non-energy emissions.
a) Guideline B 1: guide a change in the energy mix towards
completely carbon-free energy consumption during the use
phase of new and existing buildings
 Consolidate the clear strategic guidelines, through for example incentive pricing signals,
the introduction of regionally-relevant GHG criteria in the various public policy instruments
to complement the energy efficiency criteria modelled on current E+/C- experiments,
targeted grants for heating and domestic hot water systems that are highly energy efficient
and use less carbonised energies, incorporation of the “decarbonised energy” objective in
the information on building energy performance (energy audit, renovation passports and
energy performance certificate (DPE in French), etc.).
 Take into account the pressure, at term, on the resources required for carbon-free forms of
energy (notably biomass and natural resources such as metals), and prioritize the use of
the best adapted carbon-free solutions for each type of building by accounting for changes
in the energy mix and the local potential (notably for heating networks), including self-
consumption85. For the production of heating and domestic hot water, before electricity
(completely carbon-free) and gas (completely carbon-free), prioritize:
◦ For individual housing:
▪ High performance heat pumps including from the point of view of cooling fluids
(electric or gas, taking into account resource availability), complemented by Joule
effect systems, as well as, for the geographic zones and uses where these
technologies are appropriate, thermal solar and geothermal energy;
83 In terms of the Renovation plan
84 The whole building is renovated to achieve high performance (windows, walls, roof, etc.) during a complete renovation. It is
possible to meet the goal of the equivalent of 500,000 complete renovations with non-complete renovations but this would
increase the number of renovations required.
85 Whatever the scale: that of the building or the neighbourhood.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 80/176▪ Biomass.
◦ For collective housing:
▪ connection to a heat network using both renewable and recovered energies, high
performance heat pumps including from the point of view of cooling fluids (electric
or gas, taking into account resource availability), complemented by Joule effect
systems, as well as, for the geographic zones and uses where these technologies
are appropriate, thermal solar.
◦ Overseas:
▪ Thermal solar energy for domestic hot water, to limit electricity demand;
▪ Solar panels for other electricity needs.
◦ in the short term, prioritize dropping oil and coal heating, and in particular, aim to
completely drop individual oil heating and the use of fuel oil in government buildings by
2028.
b) Guideline B 2: encourage the renovation of the whole existing
residential housing stock and tertiary sector buildings to attain
an average BBC (low consumption building) level across all
housing and tertiary building stock
 The pace of renovation should accelerate sharply in the residential and tertiary sectors, in
particular to reach 500,000 housing renovations per year86  in the short term, with a
minimum target of 370,000 equivalent complete renovations per year after 2022, and then
at least 700,000 equivalent complete renovations over the long term in the residential
sector, in order to radically renovate the entire existing housing stock by 2050. This
acceleration requires substantial investment costs to be met.
◦ In the short and medium term, target in particular energy “sieves” where gains have the
highest potential, by considering both the consumption classification and GHG
emissions noted in the energy performance certificate (DPE).
 Meeting the objectives also requires a progressive rise in renovation projects, however this
rise must be very fast and intense in both quality and scope. A second issue for the
decarbonisation of the sector is therefore to reconcile the required acceleration in the
scope of renovations with the public and private investment capacities. This will require the
introduction of adequate incentives that reach the entire population.
◦ Guarantee a high level of performance (in terms of energy efficiency while integrating
use criteria such as summer comfort) for the renovation actions, aiming for an
equivalent of BBC level on average across the stock
◦ contain expenditure and avoid "dead-ends" of partial renovations that could not become
more comprehensive renovations
◦ strengthen support for households when optimising renovation work (cf. energy audit).
The network of FAIRE spaces should therefore encompass the whole increase and
their load should be increased.
 Develop the use of the least carbon-based renovation and insulation products and use
materials that contribute to storing atmospheric carbon in buildings.
 To meet these challenges:
◦ all incentive levers must be mobilised.  It is in particular about appealing to the needs
and desires of improving comfort and quality of life in buildings (summer comfort,
reduction of discomfort, acoustics, hygrothermics, indoor air quality, maximised natural
light supply, etc.).
86 In terms of the Renovation plan
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 81/176◦ Beyond technical and financial support for individuals, co-owners and social housing
associations, strong incentives will eventually be indispensable, notably strengthening
and implementing the most relevant recommendations of the IGF-CGEDD report in
favour of energy renovation in the private rented housing stock (prohibition from renting
if the energy renovation work has not been carried out, recording the absence of work
carried out, grants for consultations/audits). These provisions have already been partly
included in the energy-climate law of 2019.
◦ We will also need to continue efforts in research, innovation and development (cf.
chapter 4.1.iii. “Research and Innovation policy”), on knowledge of the stock and the
technologies as well as on the instruments used, including contractual arrangements
(high performance markets), including optimising renovation objectives and methods
based on a detailed segmentation of the stock.
◦ In particular the objectives on the thermal efficiency of the envelope to be attained
should be defined, depending on the different types of building. These objectives
should reconcile the cost of the renovation with systematically achieving a high
performance insulation of the building87. These objectives could be adjusted slightly in
favour of the carbon-free energies to be prioritised cited in guideline B 1.
 In coherence with the energy renovation plan for buildings, develop and maintain ambitious
programmes aiming to support a rise in the skills of building professionals and a profound
transformation in products and services on offer for renovations, which should eventually
offer concrete guarantees of energy results.
 Improve results monitoring for the renovations and incentive measures, including from the
perspective of user behaviour.
 Renovate all of the tertiary building stock, and set an example by initiating very high
performance renovations in public buildings:
◦ Target all of the tertiary building stock, including small buildings, for which the
obligations could be applied, with however more gradual demands than for large
buildings. As a reminder, the baseline scenario aims at a target of 3% of the tertiary
stock renovated on average per year between 2015 and 2050.
◦ In the short term, the plan for the energy renovation of buildings sets the objective of
reducing the energy consumption of the State's building stock by 15% by 2022,
compared to 2010. The State will seek to reduce the energy consumption of its stock
by pulling all the levers available, including beyond simple renovation works (low
investment actions such as active management and eco-actions, rationalisation and
densification of the stock, etc.)88
◦ Continuing to support local authorities in renovating their housing stock.
 Overseas, the aim of the renovations will be to limit the need for air conditioning by
protecting buildings from sunlight
87 Areas of concern in the renovation standards: the renovation plan aims to meet a target of 380,000 renovations in the private stock
per year (+120,000 in the social stock), without defining the performance level expected. According to the OPEN 2015 study, in
2014 the level of high performance renovations stood at 288,000 in private stock per year (at least two actions of “high
performance” level in two different places), of which only 109,000 were overall “very high performance” renovations (at least 3 acts
of “high performance” or “average performance” levels, including 2 “high performance” actions) and 30,000 at BBC level
(Observatoire BBC Effinergie). N.B. The OPEN survey data do not take into account renovations in the shared parts of multi-family
buildings and are therefore partly underestimated). According to the TREMI 2017 survey, which succeeded OPEN for single-family
houses, the estimation of energy renovation performance is based on a simplified thermal calculation module that evaluates the
energy consumption of each dwelling before and after work for heating, DHW and air-conditioning purposes.  The results are
presented according to the evolution of the surface energy consumption of the dwelling expressed via their DPE.  Over the 2014-
2016 period, 260,000 renovations have resulted in a jump of two or more DPE energy classes.
88 In this context, the government’s Large Investment Plan has set aside 4.8 billion euros: 1.8 billion euros for state buildings,
particularly administrative hubs, and 3 billion euros for renovation projects by regional authorities (including 2.5 billion euros over 5
years in the form of incentive loans from the Caisse des Dépôts).
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 82/176c) Guideline B 3: improving the energy and carbon performance
levels of new buildings in future environmental regulations
 Favouring approaches included in life cycle analyses.
 Future regulations should systematically allow for high performance building insulation and
the development of the use of renewable energies. The introduction of an LCA “building”
greenhouse gas criterion and a building envelope criterion like Bbio (bioclimatic: allowing
for a reduction in the building’s energy requirements due to its design) to the model of what
is now the E+C- Trial, would allow for similar envelope performance levels for all energy
sources — ensuring that priority is given to carbon-free energy sources according to
guideline B 1 — and for useful information to be given to consumers.
 It is essential to effectively integrate summer comfort when designing buildings, relying in
particular on nature-based solutions, so as to limit the use of air-conditioning, given the
foreseeable increase in the frequency and intensity of heat episodes.
 Future building regulations, as indicated by the E+C- Trial, will also have to promote less
carbonised construction materials and equipment with superior energy and environmental
performance, such as, in some cases, those that are bio-based or from the circular
economy, via performance objectives set for the carbon footprint of a building throughout
its life cycle.
 Future regulations on new buildings must lead to an improvement of carbon reservoirs via
the storage of atmospheric carbon within building materials.
d) Guideline B 4: aiming for more energy efficient equipment and
moderated use
 Reducing specific consumption: reducing the average unit consumption of electrical
equipment, advancing the dissemination of smart technologies for controlling demand.
 Promoting lifestyle and consumption changes geared towards improved energy sobriety
through information and awareness campaigns, by encouraging households to use
equipment less frequently or more efficiently, by curbing the amount of equipment used
and by providing support to users following works, so as to reduce the risk of possible
misuse and negative offshoot effects (cf. chapter 4.2.v. “Citizens’ education, awareness
and assimilation of issues and solutions”).
e) Areas of concern
 The required pace of renovation is highly ambitious.
 Renovating all existing buildings to achieve a BBC (low consumption building) level for all
housing stock requires both major investments and powerful agents guiding funding in that
direction.
 In these renovation and construction actions, particular attention must be paid to the
impacts on air quality, resource consumption, biodiversity, waste (cf. chapter 4.2.vii) and
the preservation of the landscape and architectural heritage. All these parameters will be
assessed during impact studies.
  Renovation actions must preserve the micro-environments that encourage biodiversity
within the buildings.

iii. Agriculture
A.Overview and challenges
a) Sector emissions – carbon sequestration
Emissions related to the agricultural sector accounted for 86.0 Mt CO eq in 2017, i.e. 18.5% of
2
France’s total greenhouse gas emissions. They have fallen by 7.6% between 1990 and 2017.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 84/176Emissions related to the sector’s energy consumption represent only 11.2% of the total. Its primary
emissions are methane (CH  – 44.8%), primarily related to livestock farming, and nitrous oxide
4
(N O – 42.6%), primarily related to nitrogen fertilisation.
2
Progression of GHG emissions in Mt CO2eq for the agriculture sector since 1990
e: estimation. Source: CITEPA inventory May 2019, SECTEN format – Kyoto Protocol scope, data not
adjusted for climatic variations.89
At the same time, the sector can hold carbon in soils (especially permanent grasslands or
wetlands on cultivated land) and in agroforestry systems or release it. Therefore according to the
inventory methodologies currently used, agricultural land (crops and grasslands) released 9.5
MtCO eq in 2017, compared to 9.8 MtCO eq in 199090.91
2 2
Compared to the emission reduction targets, the sector's emissions are slightly higher than the set
targets, with an overrun of the 2015-2018 carbon budget estimated at +8 MtCO eq (i.e.
2
approximately +2.4% - cf. chapter 3.2. 2015-2018 carbon budget balance).
b) The agricultural sector’s particularities
The sector faces multiple challenges: feeding populations, providing energy and materials,
ensuring the sustainability and biodiversity of land, meeting growing demands regarding the
sanitary quality and environmental aspects of production, and coping with increased land
pressure, all while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants under suitable economic
and social conditions.
Plants need nitrogen to grow. Even if it is possible to optimize the use or form of the nitrogen used
and improve plant efficiency, any nitrogen put into the land is naturally followed by emissions of
N O, a powerful greenhouse gas, which it is not possible to get rid of completely.
2
Likewise, the rumination of farm animals leads to the emission of CH  via enteric fermentation,
4
which can be limited to some degree by different feeding practices, but is also ultimately
unavoidable.
Consequently, growing crops or farming animals is naturally accompanied by emissions of
greenhouse gases in the form of N O and/or CH , which vary greatly according to the quantities
2 4
produced.
On the other hand, the land sector (agriculture and forestry) absorbs CO  from the atmosphere via
2
photosynthesis and can sequester it within soils or above-ground biomass. It can therefore offset
89 Carbon budget provisionally adjusted in 2019 following the changes in greenhouse gas emissions accounting and in conformity
with the implementing decree no. 2015-1491 of 18 November 2015 relative to national carbon budgets and the national low carbon
strategy. This will be definitively adjusted in 2020.
90 Emissions and absorption related to land use and land-use change are not included in the emissions from the agriculture sector
presented in the introduction to this chapter.
91 These emissions mainly reflect emissions from land-use changes (e.g. conversion of permanent grassland to cropland), with
significantly lower emissions and absorption from cropland management.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 85/176direct greenhouse gas emissions to a certain degree, but the process is reversible.
Finally, non-food agricultural production can help reduce the country's total emissions by taking on
production of other products, by providing renewable energy and materials, bio-based chemicals,
etc.
B.Strategy
The strategy aims for an 18% reduction in the sector's emissions in 2030 compared to 2015 and a
46% reduction by 2050, excluding agricultural land whose emissions and absorptions are
accounted for in the land sector (LULUCF).
Past and projected emissions in the agriculture sector (excluding LULUCF) between 1990 and
2050 (in MtCO eq)
2
e: estimation. Sources: CITEPA inventory of April 2018 in SECTEN format and in the Kyoto plan scope; AME
and AMS 2018 Scenarios
The strategy for the sector is based first and foremost on continuing and intensifying actions
related to the agro-ecological transitional plan and precision agriculture so as to bolster systems
that directly or indirectly emit fewer greenhouse gases (organic farming, High environmental value
(Haute   Valeur   Environnementale),   optimisation   of   grassland   area   management,   nitrogen
optimisation, innovation, improving protein autonomy on livestock farms, closing off carbon and
mineral cycles, legume crops etc.) and preventing carbon destocking and encouraging carbon
storage within soils by increasing the amount of organic matter in soils, respecting the
environment and the wellbeing of animals.
In overseas territories, rolling out the agro-ecological plan aids in limiting the high food
dependency of these regions by supporting an increase in their agricultural production.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 86/176Developing the bioeconomy will allow for the provision of energy and materials that emit fewer
greenhouse gases to the French economy, taking care to limit negative environmental impacts
(pollution, loss of soil organic matter, etc.) while making a positive contribution to the sector's
added value.
Additionally, the strategy will take demand into account, focusing on losses and waste and the
methods of agricultural and food consumption, influenced by nutritional recommendations and the
possibility of products moving upmarket. These are consistent with the National Food and Nutrition
Programme (PNAN) presented in September 2019, which sets the course for food policy for 2019-
2023, and the resulting National Food Programme (PNA) and National Nutrition and Health
Programme (PNNS) 2019-2023 presented in September 2019.
Therefore, in concert with the French National Food Conference and the so-called “EGALIM”92
law, the strategy will improve the sector’s environmental performance and rely on value creation
and a greater return of value for farmers.
Finally, in the long term, the trend towards decarbonisation could go hand in hand with a relocation
of production to France, as this trend is backed up by growing consumer demand for local
products. Aside from the fact that a strong national agricultural base is required for a balanced and
approved low carbon transition, relocating production to France could help better control France's
carbon footprint (cf. chapter 4.1.i . “Carbon footprint”) and reduce the risk of imported
deforestation.
Several guidelines related to the agricultural sector are presented within the cross-disciplinary
chapters of this strategy, and therefore are not repeated here. These are:
 taking into account a product’s footprint: some emissions related to agricultural production
may take place outside of the French territory (or take place on the French territory, but are
products destined for export). In particular regarding high-impact indirect land use change
biofuels. The revised European Renewable Energy Directive93 provides for their gradual
reduction in use from 2023 until 2030;
 research and innovation, as they determine many of the necessary changes;
 urban planning and development, particularly the fight against land take, in connection with
carbon storage, the circular economy and production;
 citizens’ education, awareness and assimilation of issues and solutions, as farming
systems are highly dependent on their eating habits;
 employment, skills, qualifications, and occupational training all constitute major levers for
engagement in the transition at individual and regional level, as well as being an important
means for removing non-economic obstructions.
Finally, two other sectors are strongly connected to the agricultural sector. Forestry, whose
developments are often linked to agriculture, and industry, as agricultural products are largely
processed by the agri-food industry.
Across all of the guidelines set out below, France has an ambitious position in the negotiations on
the future Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) post-2020. This position concerns both the
strengthening of environmental requirements at the European level, including the possibility for the
CAP to support changes in practices and production systems in favour of environmental protection
and the fight against climate change. France is therefore proposing an environmental scheme
(Eco-scheme) in the first pillar of the CAP. It supports the new environmental architecture
proposed by the Commission, which offers effective tools for raising environmental ambition and
the principle of a minimum threshold for environmental expenditure, integrating climate-related
issues at European level, guaranteeing a common ambition.

 Optimising the nitrogen cycle so as to minimize nitrogen surpluses: significant development
of single or mixed legumes; for the circular economy, optimising the use of livestock
manure and other organic fertilizers in order to reduce the use of mineral fertilizers, and
using lower emissions mineral fertilizers; decision support tools for the entirety of the cycle
in order to provide inputs suited to crop needs; varieties selected for their low input
requirements; improving soil conditions in order to reduce N O emissions (e.g. pH);
2
 Reducing excess protein intake in animal diets
 Improve self-sufficiency in plant proteins (with an effect on the fight against imported
deforestation) and promote greater use of legumes, fodder and seeds, in animal feed as
well as in human food, in particular in connection with the protein strategy.
Methane - CH

 Improving livestock effluent management for indoor livestock farming (covering slurry pits,
biogas flares, adopting anaerobic digestion)
 Optimising herd management so as to reduce unproductive periods or improve marketed
products (managing health, reducing birth mortality rates, optimising age at first calving,
developing fattening systems, etc.)
 Limiting enteric fermentation through adjustments to animal feed (e.g. use of flaxseed) or
genetic selection.
Areas of concern:
 Ensuring support for the development of usage opportunities for new products (such as
legumes)
 Considering mixed farming (polyculture-livestock) complementarity at a regional level
 A decline in livestock numbers would mean reduced availability of organic fertilizers of
animal origin, which should be taken on board in nitrogen cycle management, particularly
within the context of developing organic farming. While balance can be achieved at the
national level, tensions may arise regionally due to pre-existing regional specialisations.
b) Guideline A 2: reducing CO  emissions from the use of fossil
2
fuels and developing the use of renewable energies
 Reducing energy consumption: building and material energy efficiency, development of
more energy efficient practices. These actions also act as sources of economic gains. As a
reminder, the baseline scenario aims to halve the sector's energy consumption by 2050;
 Develop and make the use of renewable energy widespread: biomass, solar, wind,
geothermal, etc. As a reminder, the baseline scenario plans for significant electrification, in
particular through the use of heat pumps or electric tractors where possible.
Areas of concern:
 The expected increase in fossil fuel prices will affect the agricultural sector (materials and
inputs) in the short term. Therefore it is important to rapidly activate catalysts for energy
transition within the sector in order to prevent its added value from being negatively
affected.
 Certain beneficial practices for the environment, such as reducing the use of phytosanitary
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 88/176products, may in turn lead to increased mechanised work in plots and fields, therefore
increasing fuel consumption. Therefore it is important to consider CO consumption targets
2 
as part of a comprehensive approach regarding the overall environmental performance of
farms.
c) Guideline A 3: developing low carbon energy production and
the bioeconomy in order to contribute to the overall reduction
of CO  emissions in France and bolstering the added value of
2
the agricultural sector
 Developing anaerobic digestion for livestock effluents or low worth crop production
(intermediate biofuel-producing crops, crop residues, even surplus grass etc.) 94;
 Developing wind power on farms and solar power on farm buildings 95
 Making use of wood energy from agroforestry96;
 Diversify liquid biofuel production so as to ensure advanced biofuel development97
 Developing other facets of the bioeconomy, such as the production of bio-based materials
or chemicals for their ability to replace materials of non-renewable origin98.
 As a reminder, the baseline scenario sets out that 2/3 of the total biomass mobilised by
2050 for energy production will come directly or indirectly from the agricultural sector.
Areas of concern:
 Particular attention must be paid to the tensions between the biomass user sectors, with
priority being given to food in the event of a conflict of use, and in the bioeconomy sectors
to the uses with the longest lifespans and greatest potential for substitution. The work on
the National Biomass Mobilisation Strategy and regional biomass schemes provides an
opportunity to regularly review these potential tensions, particularly on the basis of data
from the National Observatory of Biomass Resources.
 To be fully assimilated by the agricultural sector, renewable energy production must be
implemented at farm or group level, not outsourced:
◦ The income generated will in turn make it easier to finance the agricultural sector’s
transition
◦ Agronomic areas of concern will also be easier to take into account: minerals and
organic matter returning to the soils serving to maintain or improve soil fertility; control
over materials feeding anaerobic digestion so as to limit the risk of contamination of
digestates intended for use on agricultural land.
d) Guideline A 4: ceasing carbon destocking from agricultural
soils and reversing the trend, in line with the “4p1000, soils for
food security and the climate” initiative99
 Preserving permanent pastures
 Widely developing agroforestry, which will generate an additional income source for the
sector, as well as an additional source of biomass

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 89/176 Increasing the input of crop residues and high quality organic matter into soils
 Developing agro-ecological crop practices that are favourable to carbon sequestration, in
particular by combining a reduced amount of tillage, permanent cover and longer crop
rotations, as well as developing grass buffer strips
 Preserving agricultural wetlands
 Guidelines related to the fight against land take (cf. chapter 4.1.iv. “Urban planning and
development”) complement this guideline (and are essential to supporting agricultural
production).
Areas of concern:
 Soil carbon stocks should be either preserved or increased, while monitoring soil fertility
which is often but not always connected
 Increasing carbon in soil often implies a need for additional nitrogen, which must be taken
into account with the actions taken
 Most of the time, a saturation effect on soil sequestration dynamics takes place after a few
decades
 Gains are reversible (natural disasters, changes in land use or changes in climatic
conditions that could lead to heightened soil CO  emissions)
2
 Producing biomass allowing for soil carbon inputs depends on the crops’ ability to adapt to
climate change, and on water needs and availability in particular.
e) Guideline A 5: influencing demand and consumption in the
food chains in connection with the National Food and Nutrition
Programme (PNAN)
There are five aspects to take into account in order to have a positive influence on demand:
 Reduce losses and waste at all links in the food chain; for the record, the SNBC baseline
scenario sets out that avoidable post-production waste will decrease from 14% in 2015 to
5% in 2050.
 Set up information and awareness-raising campaigns aiming at widespread public
assimilation of nutritional recommendations, leading to a limiting of excess consumption of
meat products and meat (excluding poultry) in particular, and increasing the consumption
of legumes, fruit and vegetables. To follow these recommendations is to emphasize a
change in protein balance favouring vegetable proteins. These campaigns will also focus
on promoting products from channels that are local, sustainable, seasonal, and minimally
processed
 Relocate agriculture and food by supporting the development of regional food projects and
the use of institutional catering to promote a supply of high quality, sustainable products,
bolstering the income of farmers and promoting food choices that are favourable to health
and respectful of the environment
 Compensate for decreased demand volumes resulting from produce upselling, particularly
animal production, so as to increase income per product unit, e.g. via developing organic
farming, promoting grass-fed dairy (which is also beneficial to carbon storage), and
developing official signs of quality and merits (Haute Valeur Environnementale - “High
Environmental Value”, in particular). To this end, mechanisms that support the transition of
production methods will be developed (higher value returned to the producer, new value
distribution throughout the supply chain, tailored assistance and insurance mechanisms)
 Vary production and business opportunities in order to supplement income, notably via
renewable energy production (including anaerobic digestion, advanced biofuels, hedge
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 90/176biomass etc.) and the bioeconomy.
Areas of concern:
 Several issues arise with upselling and its promotion: rolling out products of this type will
take them out of a niche economy and economic models are lacking for the evaluation of
the effects; the consequences on household food spending must be taken into account
(reshuffling purchase choices, helping the impoverished, demand for cheap products
remains high etc.)
 Action regarding domestic demand is not necessarily wholly carried out on domestic
production, given import-export dynamics. Export strategies will need to take these issues
into account, and will gradually be able to favour value over quantity
 Fruit and vegetables are already a major import item, increasing production nationally
needs to be put in perspective by looking at water availability given the significant
requirements of this kind of produce.
f) Guideline   A   6:   improving   inventory   and   monitoring
methodologies
 Developing inventory methodologies allowing for better analysis of good practices,
technical progress and innovations
 Encouraging the development of monitoring and evaluation methodologies for private or
public promotion of environmental services or progress made.
Areas of concern:
 Current inventory methodologies sometimes come with a great deal of uncertainty (N O,
2
soil carbon, greenhouse gas accounting including emissions outside the French territory).
This should not hinder action in anticipation of improvement, and should favour actions with
co-benefits.
g) Areas of concern
 We must strive for overall consistency with other issues: adaptation to climate change
(balanced water management by maintaining or restoring the optimal functioning of the
ecosystem and prioritising saving water, which can be combined with storage or resource
transfer, when these contribute to achieving the balance of water bodies, changes in
agronomic routes or system choices) ; maintenance of carbon in agricultural wetland and
peatland soils; issues related to the maintenance of soil fertility, with sufficient return of
organic matter and nutrients; phytosanitary issues, disease or weed control, while reducing
the environmental impacts related to inputs; biodiversity issues...
 Agricultural activity takes place in a largely open world, whose determining factors (global
demand, prices etc.) are, for the most part, external. If international climate diplomacy’s
aim is to guide all countries in the same direction, it will not happen at the same speed. It is
important for production not to be offshore for the benefit of regions with lower
environmental ambitions, and cross-disciplinary consideration of sustainable development
issues in trade agreements must be bolstered, notably via ratification of and regard for the
legally binding obligations of the Paris Agreement, an essential clause in EU agreements
(see also chapter 4.1.i. “Carbon footprint” and its guideline E-C 1);
 Changes in systems brought about by these evolutions are major and occasionally go
against current trends, such as sectorial and regional specialisation. It is therefore
important to support the sectors’ transformation and to ensure synergy and coherence
between their strategies, which will also bolster their ability to deal with future climate
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 91/176change. On the other hand, the agricultural world is changing, and the population pyramid
forecasts major generational renewal in coming years, which can accelerate system
transformation.

iv. Forest-wood
A.Overview and challenges
a) Sector particularities
 French forests occupy nearly 26Mha, of which 9Mha are overseas (8Mha in French
Guiana) and 17Mha in Metropolitan France, i.e. 31% of Mainland France.
 Since the “forestry minimum (minimum forestier)” of the early nineteenth century, forests
have experienced a trend towards growth (from 7Mha in 1800 to 16Mha in 2014) with
major capitalisation of standing timber. This expansion has occurred primarily due to the
clearing of non-agricultural land, especially in mountainous areas and in the Latin Arch.
 The forests are primarily deciduous (two-thirds, vs one-third evergreen), private (75% of
land, with the rest belonging to the State (public woodland) and to communities) and
divided (3.5 million owners, of which 377,000 hold 75%).
 They house normal or remarkable biodiversity depending on the case. French forests play
a vital role in ensuring water quality and regulating natural risks. French forests also
provide society with a wide variety of food and material products, as well as allowing for the
development of hiking, leisure and tourism activities. The forestry sector directly and
indirectly employs around 425,000 people, primarily in rural areas.
 The   forests   have   a   unique   ability   to  sequester  CO   from   the   atmosphere   via
2
photosynthesis. Biomass in the forests is therefore a carbon stock or reservoir. When this
carbon stock increases, we call them carbon sinks. Carbon sinks result from net biological
growth  100(or  carbon pump, which measures forest productivity) and wood  removal.
Removal is divided up into harvesting (what is actually taken from the forest) and logging
losses remaining in the forest. Logging losses fit into a category with deadwood and lead to
delayed emissions without immediate effect on the carbon sink101.
 In 2007-2015, while the net biological increase in annual mortality was around 125Mm³ (of
total wood) per year, the average annual amount removed was estimated at around
70Mm³, i.e. a removal rate of just over 55%. Of this harvested volume, around 38Mm³ is
marketed, the rest being logging losses and collection occurring outside of commercial
channels.
 The forestry-wood-biomass sector contributes to the mitigation of climate change via four
levers:
◦ sequestering and storing carbon within the forest (corresponding to around 11.4% of
annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2017),
◦ storing carbon within wood products,
100 Net “natural mortality”.
101 If we look at the immediate effects on the carbon sink, only removal counts, not harvesting. Conversely, it is removal that is
decisive in the medium term.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 93/176◦ substituting materials102 or chemical molecules
◦ Energy substitution
 Internationally, the Paris Agreement stipulates that parties should take action to conserve
and enhance, as appropriate, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases of terrestrial
ecosystems, particularly forests (article 5.1).
 Another particularity of the sector is its particularly long time scale. Production cycles can
go beyond a century in length, meaning that current forestry choices, particularly species
choices, must take end-of-century climate projections into consideration. Therefore, it is
necessary to combine actions for mitigation, climate change adaptation and risk
management (droughts, fires, phytosanitary attacks, storms etc.).
b) The situation in Overseas Territories
While the exact role of forests in overseas France in terms of carbon absorption is still subject to
uncertainty, emission inventories are based on the conservative assumption that the increase only
compensates for mortality and removals. The forest sector in the 5 former DROMs is therefore
considered to be carbon neutral (neither a source nor a sink), any tree removal or death being fully
compensated by the growth of other trees103. It is therefore the clearings that are likely to generate
emissions by converting the forest into another land use storing less carbon.
Total emissions are very largely determined by the balance sheet in French Guiana, as the
Guianese forest accounts for most of the forest area in overseas France, with more than 8 Mha
compared to a little more than 200,000 ha for Reunion, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Mayotte
combined. It is a primary forest, rich in biodiversity, which contains a significant carbon stock (of
the order of 1000 tCO eq/ha stored).  Forest management in French Guiana must therefore
2
reconcile the imperatives of development and preservation of the primary forest.
The development potential of the timber industry is significant (current harvesting is low and
processing industries are in the early stages). The forest is currently exploited according to low-
impact management planning: 5 infant trees per hectare every 65 years, with about 5,000ha
exploited every year.
But it is the control of land clearing that is a major challenge today. Land clearing is a multifactorial
process: urbanisation of the soil, agricultural development, illegal gold panning and industrial gold
mining contribute to it. Deforestation takes place in 3000 ha/year (0.0375% of the territory) for
farming (60%), infrastructural development (15%) and illegal gold placer mining (25%). As
Guyana's demography is very dynamic, there is a strong and shared political will to accelerate the
economic development of the territory, in particular agriculture, with the ultimate aim of food
autonomy. As 96% of French Guiana is covered by forest, this agricultural development cannot be
achieved without some land clearing. This is what explains why the Guyanese land sector as a
whole, including the forest, is a net emitter (a little over 3.5 Mt CO2eq in 2017).
The geographical and climatic specificities of each territory have a major impact on the forest
sector. In each territory, the climate change mitigation policy requires the best possible
preservation of carbon sequestering ecosystems and the fight against their degradation. Territorial
development policies are crucial here to control land urbanisation. Preservation of these
ecosystems must be carefully considered in order to adapt to climate change. The primary nature
of French Guiana forests must be taken into account: biodiversity issues require the sustainability
of current ecosystems to be ensured, without replacing them on a large scale with other forest
systems.
102 Substitution is the use of wood instead of other products, thereby allowing a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The way this
relates to the national greenhouse gas emissions inventory by sector is that sequestration and storage mean increased absorption
in the land and forest sector, and substitution means reduced emissions in other sectors, i.e. the industrial sector (cement, steel,
aluminum, plastic) for material substitution, and the energy production and building sectors for fossil fuel substitution.
103 Guitet, et al, 2006
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 94/176Counteracting illegal deforestation in French Guiana (approximately 800 ha/year) is also a priority.
c) The forestry/wood sector’s contribution to carbon neutrality
The forestry/wood sector represents a strategic sector for carbon neutrality by 2050, as it
responds to both of these needs:
 by providing the economy with bio-based and renewable energy and products,
 by making a strong contribution to the carbon sink of the land sector including forests
through carbon sequestration in forests and wood products.
B. Strategy (by 2050 and beyond)
 The SNBC acts in tandem with all of the major strategies and programmes covering
sustainable forest management (see Appendix 6. “Addendum to forestry/wood chapter”),
particularly the National Forestry and Wood Programme which specifies the 2016-2026
forestry policy and provides for a continued increase in marketed wood production in order
to attain an additional 12Mm³ per year by 2026.
 The SNBC’s forest/wood segment is covered here in a very general way. Details for the
implementation of this strategy are provided in the appendix.
 From a climate point of view, the aim is both to adapt forests to climate change and to
optimize mitigation of climate change (the goal being carbon neutrality by 2050) by
simultaneously considering effects in the short, medium and long term as best possible. To
do this we must first improve and strengthen the “carbon pump” and subsequently increase
the wood harvest as well as maximising the effects of storage and substitution. The long-
term objective is therefore to increase the importance of the sink associated with wood
products and to rely less heavily on the forest sink but in a safer way, as forests are better
managed and less vulnerable to climate change.
 This involves dynamic and sustainable management, of private forests in particular, which
can only be achieved via increased demand (specifically of hardwood) and the incentive-
based framework.
 These policies fall under the National Forestry and Wood Programme. They include the
sector’s global objective of guaranteeing and bolstering sustainable and multifunctional
forest management, and biodiversity preservation in particular, as well as the management
of soils, water resources, landscapes, natural risk protection, citizens’ expectations, and
striving to create economic value and employment.

their resistance to climatic stress
 Improving the “carbon pump” and reducing the risk of damage from natural hazards
(storms, fires, droughts, phytosanitary attacks etc.), via improved forestry management
with a particular focus on adapting forests to deal with climate change. Forestry
management must also aim to preserve forest soil carbon stocks. Research and
development work in this area is necessary.
 Developing afforestation while considering the ecological implications of newly forested
land (biodiversity preservation, landscape concerns etc.).
 Preserving forested areas by reducing clearing.
 Improving the observation and statistical monitoring of forest soil carbon content.

Harvesting more wood (increase in marketed wood by 12 Mm³ per year by 2026, and a further
increase thereafter104, with  + 0.8 Mm³ per year from 2036 onwards), in particular through
measures to encourage forest management and the mobilisation of wood, while ensuring the
104 This is a progressive dynamic management scenario. This increase will continue at the same rate until 2035 (as in the study IGN-
FCBA (2016), Disponibilités forestières pour l'énergie et les matériaux à l'horizon 2035 - “Forestry resources for energy and
materials by 2035”) then will increase in moderation until 2050.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 96/176preservation of biodiversity (for the record, the baseline scenario sets out a threefold increase in
the production of wood products for material use between 2015 and 2050).
 Prioritising uses of wood that have a longer life span and high substitution potential
(expanded use of wood in construction). Developing the eco-design of wooden buildings.
 Bolstering the carbon efficiency of the use of wood resources (improving energy efficiency
for wood energy and improving the carbon footprint of wood products).
 Developing the reuse, recycling and waste-to-energy use of end-of-life wood products.
c) Guideline F 3: evaluating the implementation of active policies
and frequently adjusting them accordingly to guarantee that
the expected results and co-benefits materialize
 Continuing the ongoing evaluation partnership started in 2019, serving to monitor and

v. Industry
A.Overview and challenges
The energy industry emitted up to 81 MtCO eq in 2017, i.e. 17.4% of national emissions. These
2
emissions fell significantly between 1990 and 2017 (-44% over this period).
84% of these emissions are subject to the EU Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading System (EU
ETS). Emissions from electricity generation are also subject to this system (cf. chapter 4.2.vi .
“Energy production”).
CO  , mainly from the minerals, metal and chemicals industry, is the main gas emitted by the
2
industry: it accounts for 89.7% of the sector's greenhouse gas emissions in 2017, followed by
HFCs mainly from refrigeration processes (6.4% of emissions), N  O (2.6% of emissions) and
2
other greenhouse gases (1.3% of emissions) such as PFCs, CH  and SF  . These emissions are
4 6
partly due to the combustion of energy required for industrial production (64% in 2017) and partly
due to the industrial processes themselves (36% in 2017).

In 2019, France's policy in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the industrial sector is
106 Carbon budget provisionally adjusted in 2018 following the changes in greenhouse gas emissions accounting and in conformity
with the implementing decree no. 2015-1491 of 18 November 2015 relative to national carbon budgets and the national low carbon
strategy. This will be definitively adjusted in 2019.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 98/176mainly based on:
 capping the emissions of the most emitting industrial installations via the European
Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS),
 the improvement of energy efficiency, in particular through energy saving certificates, and
the obligation to carry out an energy audit for large companies every 4 years since 2015,
 increasing the share of renewable energies used in industry with the heat fund managed by
ADEME, which helps finance the use of renewable energies, in particular biomass for the
production of heat to replace fossil fuels.
 Support for innovation provided by the  Programme des Investissements d'Avenir  -
Investing for the Future Programme (PIA).
B. Strategy
The strategy aims to reduce the sector's emissions by 35% by 2030 compared to 2015 and by
81% by 2050. Although the sector’s total decarbonisation by 2050 is not planned for, given the
emissions that are incompressible by that deadline, the 2050 objective is nonetheless highly
ambitious. Residual emissions in 2050 will need to be offset by the land sector carbon sink and/or
carbon capture and storage facilities. According to the current state of knowledge, incompressible
emissions in 2050 will come from the production of mineral products, primary metallurgy, certain
chemical processes and fluorinated gases, while the energy consumed will be completely
decarbonised by that time. Methods for reducing emissions from these processes are yet to be
determined.

The transition to an industry as close as possible to zero-carbon by 2050 requires an in-depth
transformation of the industry, as incremental transformations will not be enough. For this reason,
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 99/176measures that do not necessarily lead to emission reductions in the short term must be considered
now. This is why the strategic guidelines below are classed by taking into account potential
momentum and the required level of anticipation. This transition will have to occur while preserving
jobs and French industrial independence, through major commitment and a responsibility to
industry:
 Concerning consumer products, it will be necessary for economic and regulatory conditions
to be in place during the transformation of industrial sectors to ensure that they continue to
provide the services society requires with products that are in line with carbon neutrality.
 Concerning means of production and limiting final greenhouse gas emissions, this means:
◦ using disruptive technologies and carbon-free resources to reduce and if possible
eliminate residual greenhouse gas emissions from industrial processes;
◦ using technologies that capture, store, and reuse greenhouse gases emitted by
industrial processes in order to offset residual emissions (cf. chapter 1.2. “Forecast,
lessons to be drawn from earlier and foreign work, presentation of main adoptable
levers”, and Appendix 5. Carbon capture, use, and storage technologies.
 Concerning resource use, energy efficiency and eco-design will need to be bolstered in
order to manage energy and material demand. The amount of high-emitting resources in
industrial consumption must be limited to non-energy uses, and only kept for reasons
related to the technical difficulty of replacing them. It is therefore particularly vital that
industrial sectors rely on electricity, paired with the decarbonisation of electricity sources.
 Finally, concerning downstream uses, recycling, reuse and energy recovery will need to be
bolstered in order to further reduce energy and material consumption.
Aside from the fact that a strong national industrial base is required for a balanced and approved
low carbon transition, relocating production to France could help better control France's carbon
footprint (cf. chapter 4.1.i . “Carbon footprint”).
Supporting energy savings, supporting changes in energy resources, higher carbon prices, further
research and development, and adapting financing tools are the main operable measures in the
short term. Developing life cycle analyses and providing information to clients on the carbon
footprint of products and services is also a primary lever. Beyond these production levers, further
effort will also be needed to manage demand for finished products, with the aim of making
resources more efficient (product life, reuse, recycling etc.).
Remarks:
 The challenges of supporting the transformation of jobs and skillsets belonging to high-
emitting sectors into green sectors are dealt with in chapter 4.1.vii. “Employment, skills,
qualifications and occupational training”.
 Issues regarding controlling the carbon content of imported products that could affect the
competitiveness of French low carbon industries are covered in chapter 4.1.i. Carbon
footprint.
a) Guideline I 1: Supporting companies in transitioning to low
carbon   production   systems   and   the   development   of   new
sectors
 Developing long-term low carbon industrial strategies in order to avoid the effects of being
stuck with failed investments and inefficient technology, and providing for a low carbon
world and low carbon France (focusing primarily on energy-intensive or high-emitting
sectors).
 Ensuring that  industrial sector investments are compatible with France's long-term
objectives. Thinking out the industry’s transformation through 2050 roadmaps for the
various industrial sectors, taking into account major, permanent decarbonisation scenarios.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 100/176 Supporting low carbon industries, particularly by channelling public investments and
procurement towards products from these sectors (e.g. more systematic use of low carbon
construction materials or low carbon vehicles).
 Supporting a transition to low carbon industry by adapting and bolstering industry-
dedicated public and private financing tools in order to meet the financing means
necessary for such a transition. Better addressing climate risks in project evaluation:
environmental risks, regulatory risks, public opinion risks.
 Supporting industries undergoing restructuring due to a change in demand, so that sites
are as efficient as possible, favouring the creation of new low carbon sectors (e.g.
reassigning refineries as bio-refineries and higher added value chemicals). These new
sectors will aim to provide services required by society (e.g. improved BBC  level
construction and renovation) by developing the marketing of low carbon products, including
bio-based products.
 See also the guidelines in chapter 4.1.i. Carbon footprint, in particular regarding the
establishment of a carbon inclusion mechanism at Europe's borders to prevent the risk
of carbon leakage.
b) Guideline I 2: Taking part, now, in developing and adopting
disruptive technologies with the aim of reducing and possibly
eliminating residual emissions
 Furthering research and development into low carbon or non-fossil fuel manufacturing
processes   (mineral   products,   primary   metallurgy,   certain   chemical   processes   and
fluorinated gases), e.g. low carbon hydraulic cement binder, reduced hydrogen use in the
steel and chemical industries, iron ore electrolysis for the steel industry, inert anodes for
aluminium production.
 Supporting such innovations directly by, for example, sharing innovation risks or
guaranteeing usage opportunities.
 Supporting the development of means of production in France for key low carbon transition
technologies (e.g. production of batteries or industrial heat pumps).
 Support the development of pilot and possibly commercial Carbon Capture and Storage
(CCS) and Carbon Capture and Use (CCU) units with the use of CO  as a feedstock in the
2
manufacture of synthetic fuels or incorporated into long-life materials (e.g. construction
materials). Combined with a biomass energy production facility, carbon storage generates
negative emissions, which is to be strongly supported when resources are used efficiently
and the whole sector is sustainable. Supporting research and public policies for the
supervision of potential risks associated with these technologies, e.g. preventing potential
carbon “leaks” into the atmosphere connected to carbon capture and storage units. The
development of these units should not lead to the continued use of fossil fuels, but should
aim at capturing residual emissions from industrial processes or emissions associated with
the combustion of biomass.
 Ensuring consistent carbon accounting so that these new technologies are suitably taken
into account, making sure to distinguish between fossil carbon and biogenic carbon.
 Reinforce the current policy of encouraging the replacement of fluorinated gases by
appropriate tax incentives (see Pillar 10 of the Climate Plan). These gases are used
primarily as refrigerants, and certain categories of gases are particularly harmful to the
climate. Particular attention needs to be paid to limiting refrigerant leaks.
 Strengthen monitoring and controls, in particular as regards the reporting obligations of
actors in the fluorinated gas industry and obligations related to imports of HFCs. Ensure
that appropriate follow-up and sanctions are given.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 101/176c) Guideline I 3: Providing a framework incentivising management
of demand for energy and materials, focusing on carbon-free
energy and the circular economy
 Providing a framework incentivising management of demand for energy and materials, in
particular by bolstering eco-design and making it more widespread, optimising product life
span, reducing packaging, and improving and modernising equipment.
 Encouraging carbon conservation in businesses through greenhouse gas accounting and
energy audits, “material” accounting and encouraging energy efficiency through energy
saving certificates. In particular, the SNBC baseline scenario targets between 10% and
30% energy efficiency gains for the sector in 2030, depending on the sector, and between
20% and 40% in 2050.
 Developing the circular economy, waste and residual heat repurposing, and in particular:
◦ Concerning the circular economy: eco-designing products; limiting resource wastage
during the production phase; developing product-service systems; optimising the
amount of recycled materials used in products (through financial incentives) and their
recyclability and repairability; developing material accounting similar to greenhouse gas
accounting.
◦ Concerning energy recovery from waste (cf. chapter 4.2.vii. “Waste”): developing
industrial waste sorting and repurposing, while respecting the waste treatment
hierarchy: prioritising repurposing waste materials, then moving onto energy recovery.
Concerning energy recovery: developing heat production and renewable gas from
waste and reusing it in industrial processes.
 Concerning waste heat (via heat pumps in particular): implementing incentives allowing for
major development of its use on industrial sites (internally, via heat pumps in particular)
and via heat networks (external) (cf. chapter 4.2.vi. “Energy production”). In 2030, the
baseline scenario forecasts the reuse of 10TWh of heat from annual discharges of over
100°C.
 Increasing the price signal of carbon at the European and international level, and
promoting broader development of global carbon pricing. Deciding on carbon pricing tools
in a way that makes consumers aware of the price and truly influences their consumption
choices (see also chapter 4.1.ii. “Economic policy”).
 Replacing fossil fuels with lower emission energy, via:
◦ a strong electrification of the industrial sector (the baseline scenario envisages in
particular an electrification rate increasing from 38% to 41% between 2015 and 2030,
and more than 70% of the sector's final consumption by 2050);
◦ Replacing coal  with biomass, solid recovered fuels (SRF), or gas and biogas in
industrial sectors that technically cannot do without fuels (industrial processes for which
no electrical solution would be possible);
◦ Highly efficient use of biomass and renewable energies, favouring local/regional/easily
transportable resources (see the National Biomass Mobilisation Strategy)
◦ Improving heat recovery from combustion processes.
d) Areas of concern
 Particular attention needs to be paid to the risk of trapping investments in inefficient
solutions (the “ratchet effect”), as the current price of carbon does not allow for a sufficient
price signal to avoid them.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 102/176 The first task in protecting industry competitiveness is to convince our trading partners to
establish equivalent regulations allowing for the Paris Agreement objectives to be achieved
(see guideline E-C 1 of chapter 4.1.i. “Carbon footprint”). In the medium term, when a
majority of the world's countries have implemented binding rules for emission reduction,
technologies that have been developed using low carbon instruments will put European and
French pilot companies in an advantageous position.
 Transitioning from being a demonstrator to national industrial-scale production needs to
take place (cf. chapter 4.1.iii. “Research and innovation policy”) by, if necessary, setting up
support for this transition, primarily to prevent research financed in France and Europe
from only having means of production in non-EU countries.
 Effective cross-sector use and mobilisation of carbon-free energy and bio-based materials
must be pursued by prioritising solutions with environmental co-benefits and that allow for a
reduction in negative environmental effects.
 Making sure to identify the environmental impacts of new low carbon sectors and disruptive
technologies.

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 103/176vi. Energy production
A.Overview
The energy industry emitted up to 54 MtCO eq in 2017, i.e. 11.7% of national emissions. 74% of
2
the sector’s emissions are subject to the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) (2017 figure).
These emissions fell significantly between 1990 and 2017 (-30.6% over this period).

adjusted for climatic variations.107
Carbon dioxide (CO ), whose primary sources are electricity generation and oil refineries, is the
2    
main gas emitted by the energy production sector. It accounted for 96.9% of greenhouse gas
emissions in 2017, followed by methane, primarily from the gas fuels sector (2.2% of emissions)
and other greenhouse gases (0.9% of emissions) such as nitrous oxide.
Comment: Energy use from all sectors is the main source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in
France. In 2017 it accounted for 75.6% of emissions.
107 Carbon budget provisionally adjusted in 2018 following the changes in greenhouse gas emissions accounting and in conformity
with the implementing decree no. 2015-1491 of 18 November 2015 relative to national carbon budgets and the national low carbon
strategy. This will be definitively adjusted in 2020.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 104/176 Distribution by source of GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and fugitive emissions) in
France, 2017.
Source: CITEPA
a) Emissions related to electricity generation 
Between 2011 and 2016, net electricity generation was around 550 TWh in mainland France; after
a very slight decrease (-0.4%) in 2017, it increased by 3.7% in 2018 to reach 549 TWh. The
energy mix by 2050 is moving towards greater electrification of certain uses and therefore an
increase in electricity production. Major development of the quantity of renewable energies is also
planned.
Due to the structure of the electricity mix (large share of nuclear and renewable energies),
electricity production in metropolitan France is historically low in carbon. As a result, the CO
2
emissions in relation to electricity production, which RTE108 measures and publishes in real time,
have only exceptionally exceeded 110 g/kWh between 2013 and 2016, with a few peaks at over
120 g/kWh in 2013 and 2016. However, this observation is less true for 2017, an exceptionally
more carbon-intensive year due to the unavailability of part of the nuclear fleet, where the annual
average was above 65 g/kWh for the first time since 2012. The upward trend observed since 2014
was interrupted in 2018 with a 28% drop in CO  emissions in one year due to a particularly mild
2
winter. In 2018, 93% of production was carbon-free (nuclear, hydro, solar, wind and renewable
thermal electricity), with the remaining carbon part emitted by fossil fuel thermal installations (coal,
gas and fuel oil) used in particular as a back-up.
Structural phenomena have recently caused a decrease in these emissions, and they are
expected to further decrease due to the closure of fuel oil and coal power stations, plus the
development of renewable energies and energy efficiency efforts. Furthermore, the climate plan
provides for the closure of remaining coal-fired power stations by 2022, or their development
towards less carbonised solutions. The energy-climate law of 2019 makes this commitment
operational. Additionally, the commitment to no longer developing fossil fuel power stations will
further contribute to the decline in the sector's emissions.
108 In the scope of mainland France
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 105/176Emissions from electricity generation also vary considerably due to situational phenomena (mild
or harsh winters affecting consumption, rainfall affecting availability of water power and
unavailability of nuclear reactors) determining how much backup thermal power stations are used.
Finally, the amount that French fossil fuel production facilities use is also determined by the
interconnection of the European market, which contributes to security of supply.
b) Emissions related to district heating
Emissions from district heating mostly depend on the energy resource supplying the heating
networks. In 2017, fossil fuels provided 43% of the energy distributed by France’s 761 heating and
cooling networks109, with 37% natural gas, 5% coal and 1% fuel oil.
c) Emissions related to refineries
Between 1990 and 2017, emissions directly linked to oil refineries in France decreased by 37.3%.
However, this decrease is primarily due to the closure of four French refineries and a decrease in
the net production of finished products in France, compensated for by higher import numbers
given the strong demand for diesel, which cannot be satisfied without costly transformation of
production facilities. Therefore it is not necessarily significant from a climate change mitigation
perspective.
d) Other emissions from energy production
Fugitive emissions from fuels, such as methane, were reduced by 63% between 1990 and 2017 in
France. One the one hand, this decrease can be explained by the national ongoing termination of
coal mining activities since 2004, and on the other by a major reduction in the number of coal
processing sites. Emissions from solid mineral fuel (SMF) processing, among others, have
increased by 27% since 1990 in France.
e) Particularities of Non-Interconnected Areas
The Non-Interconnected Areas (NIAs)110, due to their geographical isolation, have specific energy
mixes that are not comparable to the mainland metropolitan mix, in particular due to the absence
of nuclear energy, which generates higher electricity production costs and makes their networks
more sensitive to rapid variations in consumption. In addition, their electricity mix is still very
carbon intensive - even though some regions have a high proportion of renewable energy.
Article 203 of the energy transition for green growth act provides that the local authorities
concerned shall co-develop their own Multi-Annual Energy Plan with the State, in which objectives
are defined, particularly with regard to the development of renewable energies and demand
management. These plans are currently being revised.
Furthermore, in accordance with article 56 of the Grenelle I Act, the overseas departments and
regions, the overseas local councils governed by article 74 of the Constitution and New Caledonia
aim for energy autonomy by 2030, with an intermediate target of 30 per cent renewable energy in
final energy consumption by 2020 for Mayotte and at least 50 per cent for the others. They also
aim to develop energy storage and network management technologies, develop a programme to
control consumption, adopt thermal regulations, mobilise the relevant competitiveness clusters on
109 Source: 2018 national survey of heating and cooling networks
110 Non-interconnected areas refer to the French islands whose geographical remoteness prevents them from being connected to the
continental electricity grid.   They include Corsica, Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, Réunion, Mayotte, Saint-Pierre-et-
Miquelon, Wallis and Futuna and the islands of Ponant and Chausey. Of these, Corsica, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique,
Reunion, Saint Pierre and Miquelon and the Wallis and Futuna Islands are subject to a separate Multi-Annual Energy Plan (PPE)
(Article L141-5 of the Energy Code). The islands of Ponant and Chausey are included in the metropolitan PPE.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 106/176the energy challenges of overseas France and ensure equal access to electricity for all citizens.
f) Main objectives of the sector
The energy transition for green growth act in 2015, amended by the energy-climate law in 2019,
has set the following objectives for the energy production sector:
  By 2020 : achieving a 23% share of renewable energies in gross final energy consumption
  In 2030 : achieving a share of “at least 33%” renewable energies in gross final energy
consumption. This target is broken down by energy vector (40% electricity generation; 38%
end-use heating consumption; 15% end-use fuel consumption, and 10% end-use gas
consumption)
  Between 2012 and 2030 : multiply the amount of heating and cooling from renewable
sources in heat networks by five;
  By 2035 : 50% of electricity generation from nuclear111.
B. Strategy
The strategy aims to:
 Reduce emissions by 33% by 2030 compared to 2015.
 Virtually carbon-free energy production by 2050 (with residual pollutants being fossil fuels
for air and sea transport and residual leaks — methane leaks in particular). This will
manifest itself as:
◦ major efforts with regard to energy efficiency and increased consumer energy sobriety;
◦ expanded use of renewable energies and heat recovery112;
◦ the long-term limitation of the use of internal combustion engines to essential uses only,
in view of their limited efficiency;
◦ particular attention needs to be paid to limiting methane and cooling fluid leaks.
 Generating negative annual emissions, particularly - if the conditions can be met - via
pairing carbon capture, use, and storage (CCUS) technologies with centralised biomass
combustion facilities (biogas or solid biomass), leading to negative annual emissions of ~10
MtCO eq by 2050 (see Appendix 5. “CCUS”).
2
Limiting dependence on fossil fuels will be achieved in particular by:
 a ban from 2018 on all new hydrocarbon exploration in France, whether for gas, oil or coal,
in order to put an end to the search for new resources, as well as the non-renewal of
hydrocarbon exploitation permits on French territory beyond 2040 and the phasing out of
existing concessions by that date
 phasing out coal in power generation (from 2022) and in heat production.
111 The Government has taken note of the studies carried out by RTE which show that reducing the share of nuclear power to 50% by
2025, as provided for in the energy transition for green growth act, raises major implementation difficulties with regard to our
climate commitments. Despite the Government’s proactive development of renewable energies, and given low short-term maturity
of storage solutions, France would be forced to build up to twenty new gas facilities over the next seven years in order to ensure
security of supply during peak consumption, leading to a major, sustainable increase in France’s greenhouse gas emissions. The
50% reduction target for nuclear is confirmed for 2035 in the energy-climate law, which as a date is more compatible with our
climate commitments.
112 according to objectives set in mainland France’s and Non-Interconnected Areas’ PPE (Multiannual Energy Plan), incorporating
corresponding recommendations from its strategic environmental assessment.

a) Guideline E 1: Decarbonising and diversifying the energy mix,
specifically   via   the   development   of   renewable   energies
(carbon-free heat, biomass, and carbon-free electricity)
 Pursuing and bolstering measures favouring the development of renewable energies and
energy recovery (heating, cooling and electricity).
 Ensuring that thermal production methods shift towards solutions with renewable origins, in
cases where this shift would be desirable from an economic and environmental point of
view.
 Pursuing the identification of waste heat sources near a heat network, implementing
recovery and connection, and identifying the needs and potential of heating and cooling
networks in regional plans and policies.
 Pursuing   intense   development   of   the   use   of   biomass   resources,   under   optimal
environmental and economic conditions, while respecting biodiversity, favouring material
uses and ensuring sector efficiency — including in waste-to-energy processes (see the
National Biomass Mobilisation Strategy113: crop residues, livestock effluents, waste —
particularly from the forestry sector, and other residues), prioritising regional or local uses
and taking into account the effects of climate change, including on water resources.
 Developing the biomass-based liquid and gas products and fuels refining sector and
establishing incentives to fully achieve its economic viability as the sectors become
relevant.

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 108/176 To develop optimised anaerobic digestion and pyro-gasification processes (technically,
particularly in terms of gas quality and leakage reduction, and economically in terms of cost
control) at the R&D and pilot project levels114. Ensure accurate monitoring of atmospheric
emissions in relation to materials entering the facilities.
b) Guideline E 2: Managing demand through energy efficiency
and sobriety and smoothing out the electricity demand curve
by tempering seasonal and daily consumption peaks
 Drastically lowering the French economy’s energy intensity by implementing measures in
all sectors and adopting the most efficient available technologies in the relevant fields. It is
especially important to properly articulate public policies regarding the supply and demand
of energy so that they encourage resource optimisation and the pursuit of better returns.
 Curbing demand and, more specifically, ensuring a better match between supply and
demand (flexibility and particularly load management for electro-intensive industries).
 Promoting research and innovation in energy efficiency (daily and seasonal energy
storage, industrial production lines, waste-to-energy unit, engine efficiency, thermal
insulation115).
 Encouraging moderate use of and behaviour regarding energy consumption (developing
smart devices, deferring off-peak consumption, educating citizens on good consumption
practices etc.)
c) Guideline E 3: specifying options to better instruct long-term
structuring choices, particularly regarding the future of gas
and heat networks
 Closely studying renovation options for existing building stock, see chapter 4.2.ii. “Building
sector”.
 Specify the amount of biomass that can be converted into energy by 2050 as part of the
revision of the National Biomass Mobilisation Strategy (for the record, the SNBC baseline
scenario envisages a range of between 400 and 450 TWh).
 Comparing various resource allocation scenarios as well as “power-to-gas” scenarios to
determine the consequences with regard to the use of renewable heat and gas by 2050.
Producing analysis factors (technical-economic scenarios specifically) in order to shed light
on the energy infrastructure’s technical balance, its resilience, and implications in terms of
supply/demand balance and energy prices.
d) Areas of concern
 Taking into account the negative effects of certain energy types, particularly on air quality
(thermal power stations, wood burning power stations, biofuels), on soil and water
preservation and land pressure (biofuels, biomass, solar), and biodiversity preservation
(hydroelectricity, wind power etc.). See mainland France’s PPE for specific environmental
114 A thermal process that involves heating waste or biomass to a very high temperature (between 900°C and 1,200°C) in the
presence of a small amount of oxygen in order to extract solid, liquid or gaseous substances. With the exception of a small amount
of the material’s mineral content and a certain quantity of unconverted fixed carbon, which is the solid residue, the entirety of the
material is converted into synthesis gas (“syngas”, a mixture of CO, H2, and traces of CH4 when the reaction takes place at
atmospheric pressure). Syngas can then be converted into methane via a methanation process. Applied to solid biomass
(particularly compost materials or other resources with no other usage opportunities), this technology could allow for the
production of a large amount of renewable gas. The likelihood of obtaining yields that would be productive on an industrial scale
remains to be verified.

replace food crops;
 Anticipating the effects of global warming on the water resources required for cooling
thermal power stations and nuclear power stations;
 Examining and anticipating, within the framework of the Multi-Annual Energy Plan, the
potential additional flexibility and storage requirements brought on by the development of
carbon-free energies;
 Ensuring the availability of rare metal resources for the technologies necessary for the
energy transition such as the electric vehicle (batteries) and certain renewable energy
sources (solar), the absence of tension with other low-carbon sources that also need rare
metals, and the proper management of waste generated by energy production, in particular
from nuclear energy.
 Ensuring, within the framework of the French National Biomass Mobilisation Strategy, that
there is no tension between the user sectors, with priority being given, in the event of a
conflict of use, to the uses with the longest lifespans and the greatest potential for
substitution.

 separate collection becomes the general, mandatory standard for bio-waste (2024) and
textiles (2025). The construction waste sector must also get on board. Like all Member
States, France has a National Waste Management Plan, the latest version of which is
currently being finalised (to be submitted to the National Commission for Public Debate in
2019). This plan seeks to implement the European waste management hierarchy:
prevention, reuse, recycling, other recovery and disposal.
The "waste" policy is also reflected in fiscal provisions such as the increase in the TGAP storage
and incineration: the 2019 finance law has set a multi-year trajectory in order to reach a rate of
65€ per ton and thus make waste recycling and recovery operations more competitive compared
to landfill.
Structural objectives were set by the energy transition for green growth act (LTECV) adopted in
2015:
 reducing by 50% the quantity of non-hazardous non-inert waste going to landfill by 2025
compared to 2010;
 recovering 55% of non-hazardous non-inert waste, particularly organic waste, in 2020 and
65% in 2025, notably by standardising bio-waste sorting at source;
116 Carbon budget provisionally adjusted in 2019 following the changes in greenhouse gas emissions accounting and in conformity
with the implementing decree no. 2015-1491 of 18 November 2015 relative to national carbon budgets and the national low carbon
strategy. This will be definitively adjusted in 2020.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 111/176 gradually decoupling economic growth from the consumption of raw materials and begin a
transition towards a circular economy (defined in the law);
 carrying out waste-to-energy processes for waste that cannot be recycled under current
technical conditions, and which results from separate collection or sorting carried out in a
facility designed for this purpose,
A new period begins with the circular economy roadmap (2017 and 2018), then the anti-waste law
for a circular economy (2020), aimed at better production (eco-design, inclusion of recycled
materials), better consumption (development of reuse and repair, extension of product life), better
management of our waste (optimisation of waste sorting, development of recycling and recovery)
and mobilisation of all stakeholders. The following main objectives can be cited at this stage:
 Reducing consumption of resources related to French consumption: by 2030, a 30%
reduction in the consumption of resources in relation to GDP compared to 2010;
 By 2025, reducing the amount of non-hazardous waste sent to landfill by 50% compared to
2010 (LTECV objective);
 Aiming for 100% of plastics being recycled by 2025;
 Prohibit the destruction of unsold non-food products, promote reuse via a quantitative
objective set for EPR channels, develop new EPR channels and reform the governance of
EPR and the eco-design of products subject to EPR, etc.
The adoption of the anti-waste law for a circular economy at the beginning of 2020, will be
combined in 2020 with the translation of European Directives adopted in 2018, part of which will be
done by an order. The anti-waste law for a circular economy is based on 4 main pillars:
 Put an end to the different forms of waste in order to preserve natural resources;
 Strengthen consumer information so that consumers can make informed choices;
 Mobilising industry to change production methods;
 Improving the collection and sorting of waste and fighting illegal dumping.
A summary of the project can be found in Appendix 11.
B. Strategy
The strategy aims to reduce the sector's emissions by 37% by 2030 compared to 2015 and by
66% by 2050. The 2050 target is ambitious: the sector’s total decarbonisation is in fact not feasible
by this deadline. Residual emissions, according to current knowledge, will primarily come from
wastewater treatment, incineration (especially of hazardous and hospital waste) and the storage of
certain kinds of waste (final waste). While the waste sector weighs relatively little in terms of
greenhouse gas emissions compared to the sectors with the highest emissions, promoting the use
of more durable objects and the recycling of sorted materials is a powerful vector for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions in sectors with high emissions, such as the glass or aluminium sector,
but also materials used in the building sector and public works.
A transition to a carbon-free world also requires a reduction in the use of plastics, starting with
single-use plastics, and the anti-waste law for a circular economy extends the scope of the bans
already pronounced so far.

scope; AME and AMS 2018 Scenarios
For this sector, the strategy is mostly identical to that of the circular economy roadmap.
a) Guideline D 1: Encouraging all stakeholders to reduce their
waste
 Promote the circular economy, in particular through actions to support and raise the
awareness of all stakeholders to the challenges of waste reduction (e.g. through national
mobilisation campaigns, territorial programmes and challenges, exemplary public services,
the introduction of incentive pricing for waste management, etc.);
 Reinforce the second-hand and repair sectors (cf. Circular economy roadmap: measure 6:
"Adapt professional skills from 2019 onwards to improve production at national and
territorial level" and measure 8: "Strengthen stakeholders’ offer for reuse, repair and the
economy of functionality"), by highlighting the place of the social and solidarity economy
within these activities (through the development of deposit systems, the development of
networking tools, the support of solidarity entrepreneurship and the establishment, within
eco-organisations, of reuse and reemployment funds, as the anti-waste law for a circular
economy provides for today;
 See guideline A 5 of chapter 4.2.iii “Agriculture: reducing loss and waste throughout the
food supply chain” (cf. measures 14 and 15 of the circular economy roadmap).
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 113/176b) Guideline D 2: Encourage producers to prevent the generation
of waste right from the product design phase
 See guideline I 3 of chapter 4.2.v. Industry: providing a framework incentivising
management of demand for energy and materials, focusing on carbon-free energy and the
circular economy (eco-design, product life span, circular economy, Extended Producer
Responsibility sectors etc.).
 Encouraging product packaging restrictions and loose products.
 Examining and setting up Extended Producer Responsibility sectors for building materials
in order to optimize treating the significant volumes of waste that will be generated by
renovation works provided for in the strategy (see chapter 4.2.ii. “Building sector”).
c) Guideline D 3: Improving waste collection and management by
further developing repurposing, and improving the efficiency of
treatment processes
 Developing waste repurposing, primarily by shifting further towards material repurposing
(reuse, recycling or organic recovery) and then to waste-to-energy processes:
◦ Developing material repurposing, particularly by encouraging improved waste sorting at
source and increasing the use of recycled materials in products.
◦ Developing organic recovery, particularly by extending the collection of organic waste,
including agricultural and forestry biomass residues.
◦ Pursuing and encouraging the development of waste characterisation and classification
techniques that are more specific to waste composition and the development of new
material and energy uses within the industry.
◦ Implementing waste-to-energy processes for waste refusals using waste collected
separately for recycling as refuse-derived fuel (RDF).
◦ Developing   the   cogeneration   associated   with   incineration117  and   coincineration
plants118.
◦ Developing at the R&D level more optimised anaerobic digestion (dry processes
specifically, in order to allow for broader use of biological waste), gasification119 and
composting processes.
◦ see also chapter 4.2.v. “Industry” (recycling, etc.).
 Reducing   diffuse   emissions   from   non-hazardous   waste   storage   facilities   through
establishing efficient biogas capture, coupled if possible with biogas reuse.
 Optimising the energy consumption of wastewater collection and treatment facilities and
reducing their diffuse emissions:
◦ when renovating wastewater treatment facilities or setting up new facilities, study the
advisability of introducing a stage of anaerobic digestion of the sludge produced.
◦ Developing heat recovery from wastewater treatment.
◦ Developing at the R&D level more optimised tertiary wastewater treatment processes
(nitrification/denitrification) in order to limit nitrous oxide emissions.
117 Facility primarily intended to reduce or destroy waste via incineration, i.e. via as close to total combustion as possible.
118 Facility whose primary objective is to produce energy or material products. This facility uses waste as a regular fuel or carries out
thermal processing of waste in order to dispose of it.
119 A thermal process that involves heating waste or biomass to a very high temperature (between 900°C and 1,200°C) in the
presence of a small amount of oxygen in order to extract solid, liquid or gaseous substances. With the exception of a small amount
of the material’s mineral content and a certain quantity of unconverted fixed carbon, which is the solid residue, the entirety of the
material is converted into synthesis gas (“syngas”, a mixture of CO, H2, and traces of CH4 when the reaction takes place at
atmospheric pressure). Syngas can then be converted into methane via a methanation process. Applied to solid biomass
(particularly compost materials or other resources with no other usage opportunities), this technology could allow for the
production of a large amount of renewable gas.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 114/176◦ Conducting scientific studies with the aim of quantifying greenhouse gas emissions
emitted by private sanitation systems on the one hand and on the other, quantifying the
climatic, sanitary, environmental and economic benefits of replacing them with less
emitting facilities. Encouraging experimentation in the private sanitation field, with the
aim being to promote the development of new solutions that take greenhouse gas
emissions into account.
◦ Where appropriate, e.g. in coastal areas, developing the reuse of treated wastewater,
under the required sanitary and environmental conditions, ensuring a broader
perspective on the management of water resources and a viable economic model.
d) Areas of concern
 Renovating buildings will produce very large volumes of waste, including minerals, bio-
based materials (that can be repurposed via recycling, use in construction, interior design
and furnishing), and/or fuels (reusable).
 Particular attention needs to be paid to managing methane emissions from the organic
recovery of waste through composting.
C. Monitoring and indicators
a) Main indicator of guideline D 1
 Volume of waste produced per year, per capita (households and economic players)
b) Main indicator of guideline D 2
 Measuring material footprint (material consumption expressed in raw material equivalents)
c) Main indicators of guideline D 3
 Share of waste recycled (material and organic recovery)
 Share of waste incinerated, distinguishing the share leading to energy recovery
 Capture rate in non-hazardous waste storage facilities and reuse rate of captured biogas
 Number of wastewater treatment plants and non-hazardous waste storage facilities in
France set up for biomethane injection, and their respective maximum capacities (in GW)
d) Result indicator
 Waste sector greenhouse gas emissions
e) Contextual indicators
 Population
 GDP per capita
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 115/176CHAPTER 5: STRATEGY REVISION AND MONITORING
5.1. Strategy monitoring
The monitoring of the National Low Carbon Strategy is based on a set of indicators made up of
(see full list of SNBC indicators in Appendix 2):
 result indicators directly comparable to the national objectives (carbon footprint, national
and sectoral emissions, sectoral energy consumption, etc.) and illustrating the results of
the strategy as a whole.
 context indicators (socio-economic, climatic, environmental and technological) to help put
the results into perspective.
 pilot indicators relating to the implementation of each cross-cutting and sectoral guidelines.
 additional environmental indicators put forward in the framework of the strategic
environmental assessment (cf. chapter 2.ii and Appendix 2 of the SNBC accompanying
report).
 qualitative indicators of the level of integration of the strategy's guidelines in public policies.
The list of monitoring indicators proposed in appendix 2 was defined in close consultation with the
stakeholders participating in the Strategy's Information and Orientation Committee (CIO) (see
chapter 2.4  A strategy resulting from a collective work and appendix 3), based on existing
statistical tools.   Its purpose is to set out a stable and sustainable set of indicators. The pilot
indicators may nevertheless evolve with future revisions of the strategy to remain in line with its
guidelines. This list of indicators may also be replaced during monitoring by adding newly created
relevant indicators.
The indicators are public (see first publication of the SNBC indicators:  https://www  .ecologique- 
solidaire.gouv.fr/suivi-strategie-nationale-bas-carbone). For each selected indicator, the publication
presents the most recent data or estimates available at the time of monitoring. As much as
possible, the published data series begin in 1990, or failing that, at the earliest date available,
making it therefore possible to understand the historical evolution of each indicator. Their
presentation format, based on the one adopted in consultation with the Committee of Experts on
Energy Transition and the CIO members for the first publication of the indicators, may evolve
towards a more ergonomic and accessible digital tool.
The results indicators are updated every year following publication of the greenhouse gas
emission inventories. This annual monitoring makes it possible to progressively assess compliance
with the carbon budget for the current period.
A thorough monitoring of all the indicators is performed every two years, starting from the adoption
of the strategy and its future revisions. Before publication, the biannual monitoring report is
presented to the High Council for Climate (HCC) for opinion and then, after taking the High
Council’s comments on board, to CIO member stakeholders.
5.2. Strategy evaluation
A.Retrospective evaluation
Every five years, during the fourth year after the strategy’s enactment, monitoring of all the
indicators is concluded with an evaluation of the National Low Carbon Strategy’s implementation,
based, according to the data available (first 3 years of the current period), on:
 compliance with indicative annual brackets of the carbon budget, including at sector level,
 respect for courses set by the strategy's baseline scenario, including at sector level (if they
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 116/176exist),
 the degree to which guidelines have been included in public policies, assessed, in
particular, with regard to measures provided for in the baseline scenario and the level of
ambition expected by the strategy,
 analysis of deviations from the target scenario, in particular any delays observed in certain
sectors, in order to better identify the main obstacles and the most effective levers.
The evaluation report is presented for advice to the High Council for Climate and then, after taking
into account its comments, to the CIO member stakeholders. It is made available to the public.
This evaluation allows for the identification of possible deviations from the target course and
objectives, as well as analysis of the causes for these deviations. This provides useful feedback
for the realistic assessment of a possible revision to the strategy and its baseline scenario (see
paragraph 5.3).
Once revision of the baseline scenario (see paragraph 5.3) has been initiated, during the last year
of the period, the evaluation is completed by integrating the latest inventory data and the initial
results from the prospective scenario, which therefore allows for an initial analysis of compliance
with the carbon budget for the whole of the current period as well as compliance with the
subsequent budgets.
Once revised, this is presented in the strategy report.
B. The HCC’s opinion regarding compliance with carbon budgets that are already set
and the implementation of the current strategy
Article L-222-1 D of the French Environmental Code stipulates that the High Council for Climate
issues an opinion on compliance with carbon budgets that are already set (the balance between
the one ending and the expected compliance with the two subsequent budgets) and on the
implementation of the current low carbon strategy one year at the latest before the publication
deadline for the revised strategy. This opinion is sent to the permanent committees for energy and
the environment of the National Assembly and the Senate. The Government provides an answer to
the High Council for Climate’s opinion before Parliament. The revised strategy takes this opinion
into account120 (see paragraph 5.3 and Appendix 3).
Furthermore, the HCC reports annually on compliance with the greenhouse gas emissions
reduction trajectory, with respect to carbon budgets, and the proper implementation of operational
and concrete actions to reduce GHG emissions and develop carbon sinks (Art. D. 132-2 of the
French Environmental Code). This report is submitted to the Prime Minister and transmitted to
Parliament and the Economic, Social and Environmental Council (cf. appendix 3). The
Government's response to this report is presented to Parliament and the Economic, Social and
Environmental Council within six months of its submission.
C. Prospective evaluation
During revision of the strategy and its baseline scenario (see paragraph 5.3), an estimate of
compliance with France's future objectives and commitments is carried out. Article L-222-1 D of
the French Environmental Code stipulates that the government publishes a report - entitled the
strategy accompanying report - no later than six months before the deadline for publication of the
revised strategy. The report specifies how the carbon budget and low carbon strategy projects
incorporate objectives mentioned in article L. 100-4 of the French Energy Code, as well as
France’s European and international commitments. The report assesses the environmental, social,
and economic impacts of carbon budgets for coming periods, and of the new low carbon strategy,
120 In the context of this review, this advice was provided by the Expert Committee for Energy Transition, whose main tasks relating to
the SNBC were taken over by the HCC from May 2019.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 117/176particularly regarding the competitiveness of economic activities that are subject to international
competition and the development of new local activities and growth. This report is made public.
The High Council for the Climate issues an opinion on the national low-carbon strategy and carbon
budgets as well as on this accompanying report. It assesses the consistency of the low-carbon
strategy in relation to France's national policies and European and international commitments, in
particular the Paris climate agreement and the objective of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050,
while taking into account the socio-economic impacts of the transition for households and
businesses, sovereignty issues and environmental impacts.
5.3. Strategy revision
Every five years, the low carbon strategy undergoes complete revision. It has four stages:
 as of the next review, the adoption of the law provided for in Article L. 100-1 A of the French
Energy Code (which determines, before 1 July 2023, and then every five years, the
objectives and sets the priorities for action of the national energy policy to respond to the
ecological and climatic emergency)
 the revision of the strategy's baseline scenario, which takes into account in particular the
law provided for in Article L. 100-1 A of the French Energy Code, the results of the
retrospective assessment, the opinion of the High Council for Climate, the results of
available macro-economic analyses, the international context, any new objectives and
commitments made by France at the national, European and international levels, the
guidelines set out in the plans and programmes adopted since the beginning of the current
period, the most up-to-date scientific data, the latest technological advances and the
sociological studies available on the acceptability of the transition. Close collaboration
between stakeholders (see chapter 2.4 “A strategy resulting from collective work” and
appendix 3) backs up this revision via the pursuit of consensus on the underlying
hypotheses of the scenario. The results of the scenario make it possible to assess
compliance with carbon budgets that are already set for coming periods to define the
subsequent carbon budget and to identify a feasible and realistic way for France to reach
its long-term objective.
 The revision of the strategy and of its guidelines is a stage in which stakeholders are also
strongly involved (see chapter 2.4 “A strategy resulting from collective work” and appendix
3). The revision takes into account the assumptions and results of the baseline scenario,
the results of the retrospective assessment, the opinion of the High Council for Climate and
the results of the socio-macroeconomic study.
 Conducting formal consultations (see chapter 2.4 “A strategy resulting from collective work”
and appendix 3).
Article L. 222-1 D of the French Environmental Code also details the subsequent revision stages,
namely:
 submitting the revised strategy and newly defined carbon budget to the National Council for
Ecological Transition and the High Council for Climate for opinion,
 enacting the decree setting the low carbon strategy and carbon budgets,
 presenting these decisions, the complete carbon budget quantitative assessment and the
analysis of results achieved over the last period to Parliament.
It should be noted that on the Government's initiative and after informing the standing committees
of the National Assembly and Senate responsible for energy and the environment and the National
Council for Ecological Transition, the low-carbon strategy may be subject to a simplified revision
that does not modify the general economy at times different from those mentioned in Article L.
222-1 C.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 118/176 APPENDIX 1: LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CONTEXT
This appendix indicates the main legislative and regulatory articles relating to the National Low
Carbon Strategy.
1. Content of the National Low Carbon Strategy
  Article L. 22  2-1 B o f  the French Environmental Code 
I. – The national low carbon development strategy, known as the “low carbon strategy”, set by
decree, defines the course for policies mitigating greenhouse gas emissions under economically
sustainable conditions in the medium and long term in order to achieve the objectives defined by
law provided for in Article L. 100-1 A of the French Energy Code [which determines, before 1st July
2023, and then every five years, the objectives and sets the priorities for action of the national
energy policy to respond to the ecological and climatic emergency121] It takes into account the
particularities of the agricultural sector, aims to target the most effective measures considering the
low mitigation potential of certain sectors, specifically enteric methane emissions naturally
produced by ruminants and ensures that national mitigation efforts are not substituted by an
increase in the carbon content of imports. This strategy complements the national climate
adaptation plan provided for in article 42 of planning law no. 2009-967 of 3 August 2009 relating to
the implementation of the Grenelle Environment Forum.
II. – The decree setting the low carbon strategy defines the carbon budget for each of the periods
mentioned in article L. 222-1 A by major sectors, in particular those in which France has made
European or international commitments, as well as by business sector and greenhouse gas
category. Breakdown by period takes into account the cumulative effect of the emissions in
question, with regard to the specific characteristics of each type of gas, in particular with regard to
how long they stay in the upper atmosphere. This breakdown takes into account the particularities
of the agricultural sector and changes in the soils’ natural carbon storage capacities.
It also breaks down carbon budgets into brackets indicative of annual emissions.
In accordance with the provisions of the energy-climate law, the following two points apply from 1
January 2022, i.e. for the next revision of the SNBC:
For each of the periods mentioned in the same Article L. 222-1 A, it also defines an indicative
ceiling for greenhouse gas emissions generated by transport links to or from France and not
accounted for in the carbon budgets mentioned in Article L. 222-1 A, referred to as the "carbon
budget specific to international transport".
For each of the periods mentioned in the same Article L. 222-1 A, it also indicates an indicative
ceiling on greenhouse gas emissions called "France's carbon footprint". This ceiling is calculated
by adding to the carbon budgets mentioned in the same Article L. 222-1 A the emissions generated
by the production and transport to France of imported goods and services and by subtracting
those generated by the production of exported goods and services.”
The low carbon strategy defines the cross-disciplinary or sector-wide guidelines and provisions
established in order to comply with carbon budgets. It incorporates guidelines regarding the
greenhouse gas content of imports, exports and their balance throughout all activity sectors. It
defines a long-term economic framework, in particular by recommending a shadow price of carbon
and its use in public decision-making processes.
  Article L. 100-1 A of the French Energy Code  122 
II. - The following is compatible with the objectives of the law provided for in I of the same article:

Code;
2. Scope of the National Low Carbon Strategy
A.Adoption obligations
  Article L. 22  2-1 B o f  the French Environmental Code 
III. – The State, local authorities and their respective public institutions take the low carbon
strategy into account in their planning and programming documents that have a significant impact
on greenhouse gas emissions.
Within the framework of the low carbon strategy, the amount of financial support for public
projects  will systematically - and among other criteria - include the criterion stipulating
contribution towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The principles and methods for
the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions from public projects are defined by decree (see
below).
 Decree no. 2017-725 from 3 May 2017 on the principles and methods for the calculation of
greenhouse gas emissions from public projects
◦ Those concerned: public entities and private individuals responsible for implementing
or financing public projects.
◦ Subject: taking a contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions into
account in the financing of public projects and determining the principles and methods
for   the   calculation   of   greenhouse   gas   emissions   from   public   projects.  
Entry into force: the decree applies to public project financing decisions made from 1
October 2017.
◦ Note: the decree applies to public projects subject to an impact study pursuant to
article L. 122-1 of the French Environmental Code and to public projects involving the
construction or renovation of buildings.
◦ (...) So as to allow public project financiers to take the contribution to the reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions into account in a project for which they have consented to
financing, this decree sets out the methods that public project promoters can use to
highlight their contribution to the reduction of GHG emissions.
  Article L. 144-1 of the French Environmental Code 
Ministers for energy and research approve and publish a national strategy for energy research
(...). The national energy research strategy takes into account the energy and climate policy
guidelines defined by the low carbon strategy mentioned in Article L. 222-1 B of the French

The territorial climate-air-energy plan describes methods for the articulation of its objectives with
those of the regional model provided for in Article L. 222-1 as well as in articles L. 4433-7 and L.
4251-1 of the French Local and Regional Authority Code.
If these models do not already take the national low carbon strategy mentioned in Article L. 222-1
B into account, the  territorial climate-air-energy  plan also describes how to articulate its
objectives with this strategy.
B. Compatibility link
  Article L. 141-1 of the French Energy Code 
The Multi-Annual Energy Plan, set by decree, establishes priorities for public authorities for the
management of all forms of energy in continental mainland France, in order to achieve the
objectives defined in articles L. 100-1, L. 100-2 and L. 100-4 of this code. It is compatible with the
greenhouse gas emission reduction objectives set in the carbon budget mentioned in Article L.
222-1 A of the French Environmental Code, as well as in the low carbon strategy mentioned in
Article L. 222-1 B of the same code.

3. Carbon budgets
A.Definition
  Article L.  222-1 A of the French Environmental Code
For the 2015-2018 period, then for each consecutive five-year period, a national ceiling for
greenhouse gas emissions known as the “carbon budget” is set by decree.
B. Nature of the emissions taken into account and carbon accounting
  Article L.  222-1 E of the French Environmental Code
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 126/176The nature of the greenhouse gas emissions to be taken into account within a carbon budget and
the low carbon strategy, as well as the provisions for the implementation of carbon accounting and
the calculation of the balance of a carbon budget are specified by regulations. The assessment
methodologies for energy-specific greenhouse gas emission factors are set by purpose,
distinguishing allocation methods for balances and assessment methods for action plans and the
quantification of consequences related to a change in energy consumption or production.
  Article D. 221-1 A of the French Environmental Code 
I. Greenhouse gas emissions included as part of carbon budgets established pursuant to article L.
222-1 A are those that France notifies the European Commission of, and that are within the
framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
II. – Emissions in Metropolitan France, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Réunion, Saint
Martin and Mayotte are included, as well as emissions associated with transport between these
areas. Emissions from international air and sea transport links are excluded.
III. – When the carbon budgets are initially determined for the 2015-2018, 2019-2023, and 2024-
2028 periods, emissions associated with land use and forestry are excluded from their scope; they
are only included in the scope established for the 2029-2033 period. When the carbon budget is
determined for the 2029-2033 period, the carbon budgets for the 2019-2023 and 2024-2028
periods are revised so as to take emissions from these periods into account.
C. Compliance with carbon budgets
  Article D. 221-1 B of the French Environmental Code 
I. – Compliance with carbon budgets is assessed on the basis of annual inventories submitted to
the European Commission or within the framework of the latest United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change. For the last year of each period, recourse will be made to the
approximated inventories that France communicates to the European Commission pursuant to
article 8 of Regulation (EU) No. 525/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21
May 2013 on a mechanism for monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and for
reporting other information at national and Union level relevant to climate change.
D. Changes in inventory methodologies and carbon budget adjustment
  Article D. 221-1 B of the French Environmental Code 
II. – In the event of a change in greenhouse gas emissions accounts leading to a more than 1%
adjustment to emissions for the reference years specified by decree, the balance of the carbon
budget is adjusted to ensure the consistency of the chosen methodology with the one that
overrules in its compliance assessment, while maintaining the same sector-level reductions as
relative values compared to 2005.
4. Revision of the National Low Carbon Strategy and enacting
future carbon budgets
A.Revision of the strategy in its entirety and enactment of a new carbon budget
  Article L. 222-1 C of the French Environmental Code 
For the 2029-2033 period, the carbon budget and the concomitant update of the low carbon
strategy are published by 1 January of the ninth year preceding the beginning of the period at the
latest.
For the 2034-2038 period and those after, the carbon budget and the concomitant update of the
low carbon strategy are published within twelve months following the adoption of the law provided
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 127/176under Article L.. 100-1 A of the French Energy Code.
B. Simplified revision of the strategy
  Article L. 222-1 D of the French Environmental Code 
V. – At the Government’s initiative and after enquiry by the permanent committees for energy and
the environment of the National Assembly and the Senate and the National Council for Ecological
Transition mentioned in article L. 133-1 of this code, the low carbon strategy may be subject to
simplified revision without modification of its fundamental contents for deadlines differing from
those mentioned in article L. 222-1 C. The terms and conditions of this simplified revision are
specified by decree.
5. Public participation in the review
  Article L. 100-1 A of the French Energy Code 
III. - By derogation from IV of Article L. 121-8 of the French Environmental Code, the Multi-Annual
Energy Plan mentioned in Article L. 141-1 of this Code and the low carbon strategy mentioned in
Article L.  222-1 B of the French Environmental Code are subject to appropriate prior consultation,
the terms and conditions of which are defined by regulation. This consultation may not be
organised at the same time as the examination by Parliament of the draft or proposed law
provided for in I of this article.
6. Opinions and consultations prior to publication
  Article L. 222-1 D of the French Environmental Code 
“I. – At most one year prior to the publication deadline of each period mentioned in the second
paragraph of Article L. 222-1 C of the present code, the High Council for Climate mentioned in

8.   The   High   Council   for   Climate’s   other   assignments
associated with the SNBC
  Article L. 132-4 of the French Environmental Code 
The High Council for Climate shall report annually on, inter alia:
"1° Compliance with the greenhouse gas emission reduction trajectory with regard to the carbon
budgets defined in application of article L. 222 1 A of this code and the low carbon strategy
mentioned in article L. 222 1 B;
2° The implementation and effectiveness of the policies and measures decided by the State and
local authorities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, develop carbon sinks, reduce the carbon
footprint and develop adaptation to climate change, including budgetary and fiscal provisions;
3° The socio-economic impact, particularly on training and employment, and the environmental
impact, including for biodiversity, of these various public policies.
In this report, the High Council puts France's commitments and actions into perspective in relation
to those of other countries. It makes recommendations and proposals to improve France's action,
the contributions from the different sectors of economic activity under the carbon budgets and the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions linked to international aviation and maritime transport.
This report is submitted to the Prime Minister and transmitted to Parliament and the Economic,
Social and Environmental Council.
The Government shall present to the Parliament and the Economic, Social and Environmental
Council, within six months of the submission of this report, the measures already implemented and
those planned in response to the recommendations and proposals of this report. It shall present
an explanation for each of the objectives not achieved and the means implemented to achieve
them.
The High Council shall issue an opinion on the national low-carbon strategy and carbon budgets
as well as on the report mentioned in II of Article L. 222-1 D. It assesses the consistency of the
low-carbon strategy with France's national policies and European and international commitments,
in particular the Paris Climate Agreement and the objective of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050,
while taking into account the socio-economic impacts of the transition for households and
businesses, sovereignty issues and environmental impacts.
  Article L. 132-5 of the French Environmental Code 
The High Council for the Climate may take up a matter on its own initiative or be referred to it by
the Government, the President of the National Assembly, the President of the Senate or the

of its competence, on a bill, a legislative proposal or a question relating to its field of expertise. In
this opinion, the High Council for the Climate examines the compatibility of the proposal or project
with the carbon budgets of the national low-carbon strategy.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 129/176APPENDIX 2: STRATEGY INDICATORS
1. Indicators for the inclusion of guidelines in public policies
During strategy monitoring, each of the SNBC’s 45 guidelines are associated with:
• an indicator of the degree to which recommendations have been integrated into public
policies, according to the following key:
The policies in place are consistent with the recommendation and aid the transition’s 
***
initiation.
The policies in place are close to the recommendation, but do not yet allow for the 
**
transition’s initiation at the desired pace.
The policies in place are still far from the recommendation and need to be significantly

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 138/176APPENDIX 3: A STRATEGY RESULTING FROM COLLECTIVE WORK, ADDENDUM TO
CHAPTER 2.4
The development of the baseline scenario and the definition of the national low carbon strategy’s
guidelines were carried out in close collaboration with stakeholders in order to fully take on board
all issues involved and facilitate the strategy's approval by as many people as possible. Based on
initial inter-ministerial work, to ensure an all-encompassing vision of climate policy from the
beginning, representatives from civil society (stakeholders) and the general public were asked
several times to participate and formulate proposals, as well as to give their opinions. This iterative
process concluded with the official submission prior to the adoption of the decree by the following
bodies: the Environmental Authority, the Expert Committee on Energy Transition, the High Council
for Climate123, the Corsican Assembly, the Overseas Collectivities concerned by the strategy and
the National Standards Evaluation Council before a final public consultation conducted from 20th
January to 19 February 2020.
1. Consultations and opinions on the project under preparation
A.Consultation with stakeholders
The baseline scenario and the strategy guidelines were co-designed as a result of regular
discussions with stakeholders.
These exchanges were first made via the SNBC's Information and Orientation Committee (CIO),
made up of a broad panel of about 120 stakeholders who are members of the National Council for
Ecological Transition (including representatives of each college of civil society: employee and
employer representatives, consumer representatives, environmental NGOs, local authorities and
parliamentarians), and met jointly with the PPE Monitoring Committee.  The CIO has met 6 times
since June 2017 at each key stage of the strategy review process (such as the validation of the
baseline scenario assumptions). The inter-ministerial services concerned by the strategy took part,
ensuring a strategy that was owned and integrated by each Ministry involved in its implementation.
In addition, working groups composed of CIO members and sectoral experts, including
representatives of specialised professional federations, research institutes and academics, met on
average four times.  The breakdown of these groups was as follows:
 Five sectoral groups: transport, building sector, agriculture, forestry and industry/waste
 Two cross-cutting groups: economics and other cross-cutting chapters.
In particular, they provided their expertise on the definition of the assumptions of the baseline
scenario (focusing in particular on understanding carbon neutrality at the level of each sector,
suggesting additional measures, comparing with existing scenarios and seeking the broadest
possible consensus on the assumptions adopted for the baseline scenario), on the definition of the
SNBC's strategic guidelines and on the selection of the associated indicators. In addition, 24
workshops were organised between October 2017 and January 2018 on all the themes specifically
addressed by the PPE.
B. Public participation in drawing up the strategy
a) Consultation prior to SNBC revision
The French people were called upon to participate in the revision of the national low carbon
strategy by answering an online questionnaire between 13 November and 17 December 2017.
Isabelle Jarry, head of the Commission Nationale du Débat Public (CNDP - national public debate
commission) and member of the Commission Particulière du Débat Public (special commission for
123 The High Council for Climate taking over the Committee of Experts for Energy Transition’s assignments relating to the SNBC took
place on 14 May 2019 during the SNBC's consultation period, explaining that the two bodies had given their opinions during the
revision of this strategy.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 139/176public debate) for the revision of the Multi-Annual Energy Plan, made sure this consultation
occurred. Over 13,000 responses were received. The output method for citizens’ contributions
consists of a compilation (available in both a long version and a summary version) and a selection
of noteworthy elements (also available in both a long version and a summary version), available at
the   following   link:  https://www.ecologique-solidaire.gouv.fr/revision-strategie-nationale-bas-
carbone-contributions-des-citoyens.
A vast majority of the proposals received during the consultation correspond to policies that are
already in progress or in place. This is rather reassuring with regard to policies being in keeping
with citizens’ expectations.
However, other proposals point to subjects that are not yet identified as priorities. These elements
often comprise recommendations for action. As an example, one recommendation suggests better
regulating advertising so as to inform and guide consumer choices. Some also point to areas of
concern with regard to making the energy and climate transition more efficient, consensual,
inclusive and beneficial overall. In particular, participants pointed out a need for greater trust in
products, services and transition professionals in provided information (certifications etc.) and in
public policies, through more open and transparent information.
It is important to note that this questionnaire was not a poll: interest in desired guidelines was
more important than response rate.
The online summary outlines the contributions, focusing on those that appear most likely to
effectively guide the content of the low carbon strategy.
The consultation’s results were presented and sent to CIO members and working groups. They
were also made part of the public debate on the revision of the Multi-Annual Energy Plan (see
paragraph below).
b) Public debate for reviewing the PPE
A broad public debate on the revision of the Multi-Annual Energy Plan took place from 19 March to
30 June 2018 (see  https://ppe.debatpublic.fr).  Subjects discussed related to climate change
mitigation policy, particularly sector-level energy demand management driven by the SNBC.
The minutes of the debate are available at the following link: https://ppe.debatpublic.fr/compte-
 rendu-  bilan-du-deba   t.
It most notably features recommendations from the Commission Particulière du Débat Public
dealing with matters that were the subject of recurrent comments during the debate. It appears
that a number of recommendations, whilst aimed at the Multi-Annual Energy Plan, can also be
applied to the National Low Carbon Strategy and allowed for upgrades to its content. As examples,
recommendations regarding the clarity of the document were taken into account: the legal
framework has been clarified in a dedicated appendix detailing the legislative and regulatory
provisions relating to the content and scope of the strategy, carbon budgets and the revision
procedure for the strategy. The recommendation to “Provide a specific overview of the Strategic
Environmental Assessment” has been fully taken into account, and this is represented by the
publication of a non-technical summary of the Strategic Environmental Assessment. The
Commission Particulière du Débat Public also gave a recommendation to “show with improved
clarity the link between various programme documents, the SNBC and PPE in particular”. The
national low carbon strategy’s articulation with other national and regional plans and programmes
is presented in the publicly available accompanying report.
The report of the public PPE debate also highlights important concerns with regard to citizens’
place in the ecological and energy transition. Consumer information and social innovation with the
purpose of behavioural change are concerns that were highlighted in the public debate. These
topics are also addressed within the context of the revised SNBC, particularly in a segment
dedicated to “Citizens’ education, awareness and assimilation of issues and solutions”. The SNBC
also identifies individual and collective behaviours, of which consumer sobriety habits are one of
the major levers for achieving carbon neutrality alongside energy efficiency, decarbonising energy
sectors, bolstering carbon sinks, and the use of bio-based products. Finally, the “Research and
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 140/176Innovation Policy” chapter promotes citizen involvement so that future innovations are social as
well as technological.
C. The Opinion of the Expert Committee on Energy Transition
Pursuant to Article L. 222-1 D of the French Environmental Code in its version prior to the
promulgation of the energy-climate law, the Expert Committee for Energy Transition issues an
opinion, no later than six months before the deadline for publication of the revised strategy (i.e. no
later than the end of 2018), on compliance with the carbon budgets already set and on the
implementation of the current strategy. This opinion is sent to the permanent committees for
energy and the environment of the National Assembly and the Senate.
This opinion, dated December 24, 2018124, after comparing observed emissions in relation to
carbon budgets and analysing the explanations for the discrepancies, particularly in the transport,
building and agriculture sectors, indicates some outlooks for future work on the SNBC, such as:
 Make the SNBC a portfolio of public actions available to guide the transition at different
territorial levels and in different sectors of the economy;
 Conduct an accurate assessment of the success and failure factors of the transition;
 Rely more systematically on international examples;
 To be able to question any policies implemented. It should be noted that the High Council
for Climate (HCC), set up by the President of the Republic on 27 November 2018, replaced
the Committee of Experts for Energy Transition on 14 May 2019 in its missions to assess
French climate action and the National Low Carbon Strategy. In this capacity, the High
Council for Climate was responsible for evaluating the revision of this Strategy before its
publication (see next paragraph).
2. Consultations and opinions on the draft strategy at the end
of the process
A.Formal consultations
At the end of the revision process, the draft strategy, published in December 2018, was subject to
formal consultation by the following bodies:
 the Environmental Authority, which issued its opinion on 6th March 2019, and which125:
◦ advocates an upward reclassification of the "stakes" of the issue of technological risks
and biodiversity in the environmental assessment report;
◦ stresses the need for mechanisms and methodologies to ensure the link between the
SNBC and plans, programmes and projects on a regional level;
◦ recommends strengthening the principles of the carbon footprint and greenhouse gas
offsetting;
◦ recommends that the State should be obliged to compensate for exceeding "carbon
budgets";
◦ identifies a lack of detailed analysis concerning the impact of increased mobilisation of
biomass and the issue of the availability of mineral resources necessary for the energy
transition;

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 141/176◦ identifies an overall lack of detailed measures to implement the guidelines planned for
the different sectors and to quantify the associated means, for example on social
compensation for the cost of carbon or on the means to promote a modal shift in
transport;
 the National Council on Energy Transition issued its opinion on 18th April 2019, which
mainly highlighted126:
◦ the need to ensure the assumptions of the baseline scenario are in line with recent
government decisions, in particular those on carbon taxation (including those following
the "major debate");
◦ the need to meet targets in terms of exceeding the first carbon budgets and the need
for robust monitoring;
◦ coherence between the SNBC and the PPE, and between the SNBC and territorial
planning tools and strategies such as SRADDETs and PCAETs;
◦ the economic and social consequences of the SNBC guidelines and the need for
support measures;
◦ that everybody adopt the objective of carbon neutrality;
 the  High Council for Climate, whose annual report "Acting in line with ambitions",
submitted to the Prime Minister on 25th June 2019 and which serves as an opinion on the
SNBC projects and carbon budgets, recommends in particular that127:
◦ the short-term effects of freezing the carbon component should be taken into account
and additional measures to offset its effects on greenhouse gas emissions should be
defined;
◦ the 2019-2023 carbon budget should be restored to its level set in the SNBC adopted in
2015;
◦ emissions from international aviation and maritime transport should be linked to the
carbon budgets and the objective of carbon neutrality;
◦ the measures to reduce the carbon footprint of consumption should be completed;
◦ the non-use of international credits in achieving carbon neutrality should be clarified
and the objectives by sector and by gas should be better explained;
 the National Council for the Evaluation of Standards (favourable opinion of 11th July
2019)128;
 the Corsican Assembly, whose opinion of 26th July 2019 recommends, in particular,
that129:
◦ the links between the SNBC and the plans and programmes specific to non-
interconnected areas, and in particular Corsica should be made clear;
◦ the scope of the data presented in the strategic chapters should be clarified:
Continental France, Metropolitan France, Non-interconnected areas, Corsica, etc.);
◦ the specific energy objectives for Interconnected Areas should be recalled;
◦ the elements concerning continental France only should be made clear in the
document.
 the Overseas territories, including the opinions of:
◦ the territorial authority of Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon (favourable opinion of 29th July
2019)130;

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 143/176APPENDIX 4: ADDENDUM TO CHAPTER 4.2.I CARBON FOOTPRINT
The national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions accounts for all greenhouse gases emitted
throughout the national territory in question. National inventories therefore include greenhouse gas
emissions associated with the production of all goods and services nationally, whether intended for
domestic demand or export. The inventories also account for GHG emissions emitted directly by
households when travelling in cars or for heating their homes (fuel oil and gas).
The calculation of a country's carbon footprint accounts for greenhouse gas emissions associated
with the consumption of that country’s population. The carbon footprint therefore excludes
greenhouse gas emissions associated with exported domestic products, but includes greenhouse
gas emissions resulting from foreign production of imported goods and services, including
transport. The footprint also accounts for direct emissions from households.
The two approaches, which are the national emissions method and the consumption emissions
method (called carbon footprint), each have their benefits and are therefore complementary:
 the national emissions method emphasizes production location. This approach is the
oldest and the one that prevails in international agreements. It is used for the development
of   official  national  greenhouse  gas  inventories.   It   also  corresponds  to  the  legal
responsibility of States (those with the capacity to regulate national production methods)
that have made related commitments. It is also the method used in French carbon budgets.
 The  consumption-based emissions method  – or “carbon footprint” – emphasizes
consumption location. This more recent approach accounts for practical implications with
regard to people's standard of living and lifestyle. It therefore reflects consumer
responsibility. It is useful to know that its calculation uses GHG emissions data and
economic statistics for all countries. The multiplication of data sources is therefore a source
of uncertainty. Moreover, unlike the development of national inventories, which are very
much governed by the IPCC guidelines, there are no standards or norms for calculating the
carbon footprint.
While national inventories constitute universally recognised measurement methods, the national
emissions indicator should not be taken as an objective in and of itself, justifying any means
possible for its improvement. That fact is that certain actions could easily improve this indicator
while having detrimental effects on both the economy and the climate. This is particularly the case
with “carbon leakage”. In particular, the relocation of emissive production certainly makes it
possible to reduce the emissions of the country concerned, but at the price of a globally negative
impact for the climate when the production conditions in the countries where the activities are
moved to are less favourable from the point of view of greenhouse gases.
The two approaches are therefore complementary: the national low-carbon strategy aims to
reduce both territorial emissions and the carbon footprint.
Incentives to reduce national emissions must be designed, calibrated and managed in such a way
as to prevent offshoring and carbon leakage.
France's action is not limited to reducing the country's emissions, even though this is a priority task
and the subject of ambitious commitments made in relation to the rest of the world. It is also
important to give consumers (businesses, organisations and households) the information and
means necessary to take responsibility for climate change via their consumption of goods and
services. Consideration of carbon footprints must also take place at sector level. Lastly, this
requires specific action at the international level, especially to reduce emissions resulting from
international transport and to encourage France's trading partners to reduce their national
emissions.
The calculations and methodology for the carbon footprint are formulated by the environmental
information division of the Data and Statistical Studies Department of the Ministry for an Ecological
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 144/176and Inclusive Transition.
Due to the unavailability of sources for the most recent years, the carbon footprint is the result of:
 a detailed calculation for 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014;
 an estimate for 2015 and 2018.
The carbon footprint calculation covers CO , CH  and N O, which account for 96% of the GHG
2 4 2
emissions taken into account for the Kyoto Protocol. The footprint is calculated for all components
of aggregate demand (the consumption of households, public services, and non-profit institutions
serving households and the gross fixed capital formation).
The footprint is calculated using a standardised input-output analysis method adapted to the
environment and promoted by Eurostat and the OECD. It is based on the combination of
symmetric   input-output   tables   (Symmetric   IOTs)   of   national   accounts   with   the   physical
environmental accounts of greenhouse gas emissions broken down by branch (Naméa – Air)
according to the NAF (nomenclature d'activités françaises - French classification of activities).
Namea Air and the symmetric IOT accounts are broken down into 64 branches/products. IOTs
distinguish, for their various components (intermediate consumption, aggregate demand),
imported elements from those resulting from domestic production. This separation allows for the
calculation of emissions associated with imports by integrating the available information specific to
the groups of countries from which France imports, in proportion to their relative importance with
regard to each of the 64 economic activities considered (sources: Customs). The origin of the
imports of these groups of countries is not taken into account: when France imports goods from
the EU, the goods are considered as being entirely produced within the EU (they can in fact be
produced in the EU but made up of intermediate goods from outside the EU).
Direct household greenhouse gas emissions come from Citepa calculations presented in the
“Namea – Air” format.
Greenhouse gas emissions from domestic production due to production for domestic demand
are   calculated   using   an   input/output   calculation   combining   national   accounting   statistics
(symmetric input-output of the French economy which distinguishing between imports and exports)
and French greenhouse gas emission accounts (Namea – Air).
Greenhouse gas emissions associated with imports  are calculated using the above
input/output calculation applied to EU-28 economic and environmental data. The production
conditions of exporting countries are estimated based on geographical area: EU-28, Asia, North
America, South America, Africa, Japan, Oceania. Greenhouse gas emissions from non-EU-28
countries are calculated by adjusting emission intensities (greenhouse gases/GDP or greenhouse
gases/kWh) of the various exporting areas compared to those of the EU-28:
 CO  emissions from electricity generation in exporting countries from outside the EU-28 are
2
adjusted using a coefficient measuring the difference between the CO /kWh intensity of the
2
EU-28 and that of the geographical area in question;
 CO  emissions from production (excluding electricity generation) in exporting countries
2
from outside the EU-28 are adjusted using a coefficient measuring the difference between
the CO /GDP intensity (excluding CO resulting from electricity generation) of the EU-28
2 2 
and that of the geographical area in question;
 CH  and N O emissions from agricultural production in exporting countries from outside the
4 2
EU-28 are adjusted using a coefficient measuring the difference between the CH   or
4
N O/agricultural GDP intensity of the EU-28 and that of the geographical area in question;
2
 CH  and N O emissions from production (excluding agricultural production) in exporting
4 2
countries from outside the EU-28 are adjusted using a coefficient measuring the difference
between the CH  or N O/GDP intensity (excluding greenhouse gases from agriculture) of
4 2
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 145/176the EU-28 and that of the geographical area in question.
The years 2015 to 2018 have been estimated.
The estimates are based on the latest detailed calculation. For direct household emissions, the
data are taken from the NAMEA-AIR inventory (or failing that, for the last year, the value evolves in
accordance with changes in the national inventory).   For emissions from domestic production, the
calculation is based on final demand adjusted according to its relative evolution during the year in
question. The structure of the economy and the GHG intensity of the sectors are those of the last
available calculation. For emissions associated with imports, the calculation is performed taking
into account the relative evolution of imports in the year under consideration. The structure of the
economy and the GHG intensity of the sectors are also those of the last available calculation.

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 146/176APPENDIX 5: CARBON CAPTURE, USE, AND STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES.
Carbon neutrality calls for the production of “negative emissions” in order to compensate for
residual emissions. These negative emissions can come from carbon sinks (forests, hedgerows,
soils, wood products) or carbon capture and storage (CCS) CO 136 emissions, in particular from
2  
CO  resulting from biomass combustion (this is known as BECCS, “bio-energy with CCS”),
2
As an alternative to storage, use (or reuse) processes for captured CO  could also act as a lever
2
for mitigation if they allow fossil fuels to be replaced or if they store CO  in products with a long life
2
span (such as building materials), while providing economic opportunities for the industries
concerned. They are therefore a priority area of research (see chapter 4.1.iii. “Research and
innovation policy”).
1. CCS and carbon neutrality
In the baseline scenario, it is thought that around 5 MtCO  in industry per year could be avoided by
2
2050, and that about 10 MtCO  of negative emissions could be produced annually thanks to the
2
BECCS. Following  the adaptation of the European CCS Directive in 2009, the legislative
framework is ready.
The use of BECCS will require an adequately centralised use of biomass (in fixed facilities and
therefore excluding transport), whereas bio-energy today is more often used in small facilities in a
more scattered way (for example individual heating).
Rolling out these technologies will allow for proper integration with the regions’ economies, ideally
reusing existing infrastructure and underground storage, offshore if necessary.
Uncertainties regarding these technologies, their acceptability and the availability and reliability of
storage mean that their development must be carefully considered and based on the definition of a
viable economic model combined with good long-term risk management. That being said, it is
most likely that it is an essential option for the future, as it allows for the generation of continuous
negative emissions over the very long term (with forest storage eventually reaching an optimum
level, draining carbon sinks in a few decades/centuries). Direct capture of CO   from the
2
atmosphere is also an option, but it is still in the early stages of research and development.
2. CCS in the energy sector
With regard to carbon neutrality, the use of fossil fuels for energy is only foreseen within the
framework of this strategy until 2050. In this context, the installation of CCS technologies in plants
using fossil fuels should be limited in volume in France. This being so, some developing countries
are still planning for the development of their gas and even coal power plants, potentially making
this technology attractive for export if socio-economic conditions allow.
BECCS technologies could however be used nationally in conjunction with biomass combustion
plants (biogas or solid biomass). This could potentially lead to an annual generation of 10 MtCO
2
in negative emissions. Negative emissions because, unlike the CCS used in conjunction with fossil
fuels, BECCS stores carbon that has been drawn via photosynthesis from the atmosphere in the
subsoil.
136 and even the capturing of atmospheric CO2
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 147/1763. CCS in the industrial sector
Likewise, in the industry sector, the use of CCS technologies should be considered as soon as the
environmental and economic conditions are met to allow it, for concentrated CO  emissions (from
2
biomass energy combustion and industrial processes).
As an alternative to storage, use (or reuse) of captured CO  (in new energy carriers, anaerobic
2
digestion (combining CO  and H ) and in manufactured products, construction products, etc.) may
2 2
be considered.
4. The storage challenge
France is home to 3 primary sedimentary basins in which terrestrial storage (on-shore) would be
possible in saline aquifers (the Paris, Aquitaine, and Southeast and Provence Basins) or in
depleted oil production fields (the Paris and Aquitaine Basins). The BRGM (the French geological
and mining research bureau) estimated France’s potential at around 1 to 1.5 GtCO  upon initial
2
examination. The shared locations of point sources of emissions and potential storage areas in
mainland France constitutes a satisfactory factor, even though some transport will remain
necessary. That being said, the geological CO  storage potential in France is still not particularly
2
well known on land, and unknown at sea (continental shelves). The latter, however, seems more
feasible and more socially acceptable than terrestrial storage (location of injection wells,
monitoring storage permanence etc.). Storage sites could for instance be located on the Atlantic
coast and in the Mediterranean. Storage in former oil fields in the North Sea would also be
possible, on which several projects involving, in particular, French industry sectors, are currently
being studied.

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 148/176APPENDIX 6: ADDENDUM TO CHAPTER 4.2.IV. FOREST-WOOD
The major strategies/programmes for sustainable forest management with which this strategy is
articulated through objectives and guidelines, are:
 the National Bioeconomy Strategy (Stratégie nationale bioéconomie) and its action
plan, which brings all public policies concerned with biomass together under the same roof
in order to place the renewable carbon and living economies at the centre of our economy,
by replacing fossil and mining products with bio-based products;
 the National Forestry and Wood Programme (PNFB – Programme national de la forêt
et du bois), which provides a framework for forestry policy for the 2016-2026 period,
aiming especially to bolster the role of forests in fighting climate change and setting a
usage target of an additional +12Mm3 of marketed wood. The PNFB will be organised
locally in the form of Regional Forestry and Wood Programmes;
 the National Biodiversity Strategy (Stratégie nationale pour la biodiversité), a major
component for forestry and an integral part of the vision proposed for this sector by the
SNBC. It is fundamentally out of the question that this vision be entirely focused on carbon.
 the  Multi-Annual Energy Plan (PPE), which, among other things, has set ten-year
objectives for biomass-based heat production and electricity generation capacity;
 the National Biomass Mobilisation Strategy (Stratégie nationale de mobilisation de la
biomasse), which establishes estimates for the potential of different types of biomass and
sets out major guidelines for their use, in particular in order to achieve PPE objectives
while remaining in line with the PNFB’s objective regarding forest biomass;
 the Interministerial Forest and Wood Action Plan (Plan d’action interministériel forêt
bois), which aims to revive the forestry sector. It has three main pillars: mobilising and
sustainably renewing forest resources, developing end markets and supporting innovation
and investment by improving the environmental performance of the sector and its
development in the territories.
 The Low Carbon Label, which sets up an innovative and transparent framework offering
financing prospects for local projects  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.      Three
methods concern the forest, relating to the conversion of coppice to stumped woodland
(coppicewoods),   afforestation   and   the   reconstitution   of   degraded   forest   stands
(reforestation).
 the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan. Within the time frame proposed by the
SNBC (mid-century), it is absolutely essential that climate change adaptation be taken into
account, in order to be able to put sustainable forest management at centre stage;
 The  2025 Forest and Timber Research and Innovation Plan, which describes the
sector’s main priorities in terms of research and development: increasing the use of high
value-added timber, in particular, hardwood; increasing the sector’s performance; providing
for its adaptation etc.
A.Details on the strategy’s implementation
In accordance with article 13-2-a of EU Regulation 2018/841 of 30th May 2018, France is
authorised to offset total emissions exceeding total absorption levels within the land sector
provided that it has included either existing or planned measures in its national low carbon strategy
that ensure the conservation or bolstering, as applicable, of forest-based carbon sinks and
reservoirs.
a) Implementing the overall strategy
Advancing forest management relies on a case-by-case diagnosis of existing stands, taking
into account local circumstances and potential, as well as on  research, development and
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 149/176innovation. It takes into account all economic, social, and environmental issues concerned,
including preserving carbon in soils, aboveground and underground biomass, litter composed of
deadwood and harvested wood products, maintaining other ecosystem services, respecting
landscapes, preserving biodiversity, protecting against natural hazards, dealing with citizens'
expectations and seeking to create economic value and employment.
This can manifest itself as several actions: introducing species and/or plants from origins better
adapted to climate change, diversifying species and forestry routes within wooded areas, reducing
forest rotation times in risk situations, thinning high forests for the production of quality timber,
natural regeneration, maintaining small patches of old trees to preserve biodiversity associated
with senescence in trees, improving coppice forest or coppices with standards by fencing off and
selecting natural seedlings, restoring forests that are in decline or at forestry deadlock (of low
economic potential) through planting and improving spontaneous afforestation resulting from
abandoned agricultural land. These forestry actions full under improved forest management
strategies (IFM, Improved Forest Management) that aim to ensure the long-term bolstering and
resilience of forest carbon sinks and stocks.
The production  and harvesting of wood is growing thanks  to measures bolstering  the
implementation of more sustainable and dynamic forest management methods by forest owners,
as well as through measures discouraging the consumption of fossil or mineral materials with high
environmental footprints, and conversely promoting the use of bio-based products in all areas of
the economy. This quantitative increase in production and harvesting goes hand in hand with a
qualitative improvement of the use of wood for products with long life spans and high substitution
potential, while reducing material and energy losses at all processing stages, as well as improving
the collection and recycling rates of end-of-life wood products.
The whole forestry sector is encouraged to take the same path, at every step of the way.
Silviculture and wood production are being gradually but sharply redirected towards high added
value and high environmental value markets by public policies and professional strategies.
Encouraged procedures and uses are:
 Usage of materials: under-valued sections of the production chain, particularly hardwoods,
construction and bio-based chemicals.
 Usage of energy: some large facilities, eventually allowing for the capture and reuse of CO
2
(CCU) or its long-term storage (CCS), but specifically medium to small facilities spread
throughout the regions (heat production, cogeneration, advanced biofuels and gasification)
operating using small woods, poor quality woods and some forestry remnants, joint
products resulting from harvesting and sawing, wood processing and wood waste
upcycling.
Afforestation is not carried out in conflict with agricultural production. The priority is to support and
improve afforested areas occurring spontaneously on land that is in decline. Afforestation potential
will also be looked into for certain types of land that would not have become spontaneously
afforested under normal circumstances, such as degraded land, as will the renaturalization of
artificialised land such as wasteland, brownfield land and artificially grass-covered land.

consumption of forestry machinery, limiting fossil fuel-dependent transport and developing
renewable energies within wood industries.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 153/176APPENDIX 7: OFFSETTING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
In some cases, a greenhouse gas emitter (a State, community, company, individual etc.) can offset
their emissions by acquiring “carbon credits”, which usually equal one tonne of CO  equivalent
2
each. These credits are generated by projects that avoid emissions (e.g. paying farmers to reduce
their fertilizer use) or that sequester carbon (e.g. planting trees). The purchaser of a carbon credit
can therefore consider that, due to their decision to offset their emissions, global emissions will
decrease by one tonne of CO eq, which takes the form of the carbon credit and therefore allows
2
them to offset one tonne of CO eq from their actual emissions. This system is of interest if
2
purchasing a credit costs less than the actual reduction of emissions. This is therefore an
economically efficient way to globally reduce emissions.
However, this offsetting approach only has an effect on global emissions if the reduction of
emissions (avoided or sequestered) represented by the credit would not have existed in the
absence of credit’s purchase: this is the additionality principle, which is essential to guaranteeing
the real-world implications of offsetting. In the opposite situation, the reduction in global emissions
would have occurred even if the acquirer had not made the decision to offset their emissions. This
decision therefore has no effect on emissions at a global level and thus the acquirer is in fact not
offsetting their emissions.
To ensure credit additionality, it is essential that a sound mechanism be implemented to monitor
credit issuance. Additionally, it should be ensured that projects generating credits do not have
negative impacts on the environment (on biodiversity, for example).
1. The Paris Agreement and Kyoto Protocol
Article 6 of the Paris Agreement states that signatory countries may voluntarily cooperate in the
implementation of their nationally determined contributions, which can help to optimize emission
reduction costs. In practice, a State for which reducing domestic emissions is costly may want to
offset its emissions with reductions made in another State, at a lower cost. Given that greenhouse
gas emissions have the same effect on the planet’s climate regardless of where they come from,
these mechanisms have the same climate ambitions as the Paris Agreement’s.
Article 6 provides for two mechanisms to this end in particular:
 exchanging “mitigation outcomes”, i.e. avoided or sequestered emissions, between
signatory countries so as to honour their international commitments (Article 6.2);
 a centralised mechanism with UN governance for projects generating carbon credits,
while promoting the sustainable development of the project’s host country. Projects
may be led by private organisations and the credits generated may be used by
signatory countries to honour their commitments under the Paris Agreement (Article
6.4).
The texts specifying the implementation methods for the mechanism provided for in article 6.4 are
still being negotiated, but this mechanism should be similar in principle to the mechanisms for
projects provided for by the Kyoto Protocol: the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in
developing countries and Joint Implementation (JI) in developed countries. These mechanisms
have enabled the development of emission reduction projects and the generation of plentiful
carbon credits internationally. That being said, doubts exist regarding the reality of the additionality
of some credits. This decreased demand and led to a collapse in prices and supply in recent
years.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 154/1762. Sharing the effort between Member States of the European
Union
In order to reach its emission reduction targets (-20% by 2020 and at least -40% by 2030
compared to 1990), the European Union has set up a Community Carbon Marketplace, which on
the one hand limits emissions from energy production and industry, and on the other, sets out a
regulation providing for the sharing of reduction efforts necessary in sectors not covered by the
carbon marketplace among Member States (known as the Effort Sharing Regulation - ESR).
This regulation not only sets a target for 2030, but also defines a carbon budget for each country
that cannot be exceeded until 2030, taking the form of emissions allowances issued by the
countries in question every 5 years. There is room for some flexibility in order to allow for the
optimisation of costs while complying with the European Union’s total carbon budget, such as
exchanging emissions allowances between Member States. A State may therefore choose to
offset a share of its emissions using reduced or avoided emissions in another State.
Under this regulation, France must reduce emissions that are not covered by the carbon
marketplace by 14% by 2020, and by 37% by 2030, compared to 2005. The current course for
emissions guarantees that the 2020 target will be met and the national low carbon strategy will put
France well on its way to meeting the 2030 target, notably via the use of carbon budgets. It in fact
even shows that greater than required reductions will be achieved by 2030, even though it does
not provide for the use of the extra measures permitted by the European regulation.
3. Voluntary emissions offsetting
Independent of States' international or European obligations, some economic players may
voluntarily choose to use carbon credits to offset their emissions. For example, a company may
wish to undergo an offsetting process for purposes of image. Private standards have therefore
been created to oversee emissions reduction projects and to assure potential buyers that the
generated credits are in fact additional.
In actual fact, very few projects have been launched in France. In response to growing demand
from French companies for local carbon offsetting, the Ministry for an Ecological and Inclusive
Transition introduced a new tool, the "low-carbon label"137138, in November 2018 to direct funding
towards emission reduction projects in France and to guarantee the additionality of recognised
carbon credits. These credits can only be used for voluntary compensation and therefore cannot
be used to meet the European and international obligations of France or other stakeholders (in
particular, they cannot be used for CORSIA, see below). However, certified projects will reduce
national greenhouse gas emissions and therefore contribute to attaining the SNBC's objectives.
4. The CORSIA mechanism for international aviation
The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has set a zero growth objective for
greenhouse gas emissions from 2020 for the international civil aviation sector, which currently
emits around 900 MtCO eq/year (almost two times France’s total emissions). To this end, airlines
2
will have to purchase carbon credits through the CORSIA mechanism in order to offset emissions
surpassing the 2020 target. At the end of 2019, over 70 countries had expressed their willingness
to participate in the voluntary phase beginning in 2021, which represents 80% of global emissions
from the aviation sector.
A first set of carbon credit programmes eligible for CORSIA will be determined in the course of
2020, on the basis of a call for applications launched in June 2019, where programmes must
comply with eligibility criteria established in March 2019 (such as additionality, transparency or the
137 Decree no. 2018-1043 of 28 November 2018 creating a "Low Carbon" label
138 Order of 28 November 2018 defining the reference system for the "Low Carbon" label

Net biological growth or carbon pump: increase in a reservoir allowing the absorption and
storage of carbon. Within the framework of the SNBC, we use this term to describe forest growth.
Net biological growth constitutes part of a carbon sink.
Adaptation: a process for adjusting to the current climate or changes thereto, as well as to
concomitant effects. Within human systems, this means minimising detrimental effects and
exploiting beneficial effects. Within natural systems, human intervention can facilitate adaptation to
forecast changes in the climate and its concomitant effects.139
The additionality of an emission-offsetting project: assurance that the greenhouse gas
emission reductions generated by a project would not have occurred in the absence of the
offsetting mechanism.
Organic farming: method of agricultural production excluding the use of synthetic substances,
such as pesticides, synthetic medicines or fertilisers, genetically modified organisms and
preservation by irradiation.140
Agro-ecology: a set of agricultural practices based on the functionalities offered by ecosystems
and aimed at making optimal use of the possibilities offered by agro-systems.141
Agroforestry: an agricultural production method that combines the growth of trees with other
crops or animals on the same plot, with the aim of inciting beneficial effects.142
Life-Cycle Analysis (LCA): the evaluation of the direct or indirect effects of a product, service,
company or process on the environment, from the extraction of the raw materials used in its
composition to its disposal or recycling143. The results of an LCA vary greatly depending on the
limitations of the system within which the study is conducted. The technique’s objective is the
relative comparison of two similar means leading to a product’s manufacture.144
Land take: the process of changing the use of natural or agricultural land through development
actions towards artificial land (buildings, roads, car parks, gardens, building sites, etc.). Land take
is most notably due to urban sprawl. It causes a loss of natural and agricultural resources, the
fragmentation and compartmentalisation of natural habitats, which is inhospitable for many species
and leads to the destruction of natural habitat networks and often to soil sealing.145
Mitigation: human intervention with the aim of reducing sources of greenhouse gases or
improving greenhouse gas (GHG) sinks146.
Energy audit: a systematic procedure to acquire adequate knowledge of the energy consumption
characteristics of a building or a group of buildings, an industrial or commercial activity or
installation or private or public services, to identify and quantify the energy savings that can be
achieved in a cost-effective way, and to report the results147;
Self-consumption: the act of consuming one's own electricity production. This goes hand in hand
with the notion of self-production, which is the production of one's own consumption.
Bioeconomy: includes all activities related to the production, use and processing of biomass as a
renewable source of plant or animal origin. They are intended to meet society's food, material and

Biofuel: liquid or gas fuel used for transport and produced from biomass.149
Biomass: biodegradable elements of agricultural products, waste and residues, including plant
and animal products from both land and sea, biodegradable elements from forestry and related
industries and the biodegradable elements of industrial and household waste.150
Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS): the use of carbon dioxide capture and
storage (CCS) technology for bio-energy conversion processes. Depending on total life cycle
emissions, including all consequent marginal effects (resulting from indirect land use change
(ILUC) and other processes), it would be possible to achieve a net decrease in atmospheric
carbon dioxide (CO ) using BECCS.151

Carbon budget: short- and medium-term objectives set by the national low carbon strategy, these
represent ceilings for greenhouse gas emissions that cannot be exceeded over five-year periods
(expressed in MtCO eq, annual average).
2
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS): process that involves extracting (trapping or capturing)
relatively pure carbon dioxide (CO ) gas streams from industrial and energy emission sources,
2
then processing it, compressing it and transporting it to a storage site in order to isolate it from the
atmosphere for a long period of time.152
Waste heat: heat generated as the by-product of a process, and which is not necessarily
recovered.
Land use change (LUC): change in land cover between one of the six IPCC land categories
(forest, grassland, arable land, wetlands, settled land and other land), plus a seventh category
comprising seasonal crops, including crop plantations (shrubs).153
Short supply chains: supply chains along which there is a minimum of intermediaries between
the producer and the consumer.
Cogeneration: simultaneous production of electricity and useful heat.154
Emissions offsetting: a set of financial or technical measures enabling the partial or total
offsetting of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from a specific activity, and that could not be
avoided or limited, into the atmosphere.
Composante carbone (“carbon factor”): a share included in French domestic consumption
taxes on energy products under carbon taxing procedures. It was set at €7/MTCO eq in 2014 and
2
stood at €44,6€/tCO eq in 2018.
2
Total decarbonisation: elimination of all greenhouse gas emissions.
Near-total decarbonisation: maximum reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the residual
emissions, which are unavoidable according to the current state of knowledge, being mainly due to
agriculture, and to a lesser extent to industrial processes, waste, domestic air transport and gas
leaks (biogas, hydrogen, fluorinated gases).
Energy Performance Certificate (DPE): indicates a housing unit or building’s energy efficiency
ratings by assessing energy consumption and its impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.

Circular economy: the organisation of economic and social activities using means of production,
consumption and trade based on ecodesign, repair, reuse and recycling with the aim of reducing
the amount of resources used and damage to the environment.156
Product-service systems: business models that provide the use of products and services as
opposed to their possession.157
Load management: the act of temporarily and voluntarily reducing the electrical load of a site
compared to its normal consumption.
Energy efficiency:  improving processes, technologies and products in order to reduce their
energy consumption and increase their efficiency. The aim is to achieve the same results while
consuming less energy.
Electromobility: mobility provided by means of transport for which the propulsion energy used is
exclusively electric.
Fugitive emissions: emissions resulting from gas leaks, including leaks of fluorinated refrigerant
gases in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems and leaks from natural gas transmission and
distribution pipelines.
Irreducible emissions: greenhouse gas emissions that are considered unavoidable according to
current knowledge. In the SNBC and its baseline scenario, an analogy can be drawn between
residual and irreducible emissions by 2050. By this time, anthropogenic carbon sinks will be able
to balance out emissions that are currently considered irreducible, without margin, which would
include the removal of all other emissions that can be considered as such.
National emissions: emissions from a given nation (France, in this case).
Carbon footprint (or consumption emissions): direct emissions from the French population and
indirect emissions relating to the production and transportation of the goods and services that it
consumes, whether produced in France or abroad.
Final energy: directly consumable energy (electricity, fuel, etc.) after the processing of natural
resources and the resultant losses.
Primary energy: energy found in natural resources (coal, crude oil, natural gas, uranium,
renewable sources etc.) before being subject to any form of processing.158
Equivalent CO  (written as CO eq): a unit used for comparing the time integral of greenhouse
2 2
gas radiative forcing with carbon dioxide
Externality: externality results from human activity when the party in charge of the activity in
question does not take full account of the effects of the activity on the production possibility and
consumption of other parties, and when there is no form of compensation for these effects.
Negative externality is referred to as external cost and positive externality is referred to as external
benefit.159
Factor 4 (Facteur 4): a French expression referring to a 75% reduction target for greenhouse gas
emissions in 2050 compared to 1990.

Nitrogen fertilisation: the use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers in agriculture, gardening or
forestry. Optimising nitrogen fertilisation by introducing only the requisite amount of nitrogen for
plant development would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from surplus nitrogen in soils without
reducing crop yield.
Carbon leakage: the transfer of greenhouse gas emissions by a company to another country with
less strict environmental regulations through offshoring.
Geothermal energy: the use of thermal energy stored in the Earth.
Carbon intensity: the amount of carbon dioxide (CO ) emitted per unit of another variable, such
2
as gross domestic product (GDP), the amount of delivered energy used, or transport.161
Legumes: a plant or the seed of a plant in the bean family. Legumes are of ecological and
economic interest in agriculture.  Legumes are particularly rich in protein (20 to 40% on dry seeds,
depending on the species), fibre and micro-nutrients. Legumes can be used in animal and human
food as a partial substitute for animal protein. They naturally fertilize the soil.162
Clean Development Mechanism: a mechanism defined by the Kyoto Protocol that provides for
emissions reduction projects, whether by reducing existing emissions or sequestering greenhouse
gases.
Anaerobic digestion: a process by which waste and organic matter is broken down by
fermentation into biogas, which is primarily made up of methane and carbon dioxide. It is not a
total decomposition and leaves the "digestate" that has become a waste or by-product, very rich in
nitrogen, which can be recovered as an amendment.163
Carbon neutrality: balance, on national territory, between anthropogenic emissions by sources
and anthropogenic absorptions by sinks of greenhouse gases, as mentioned in Article 4 of the
Paris Agreement ratified on 5 October 2016. The accounting of these emissions and removals is
carried out according to the same methods as those applicable to the national greenhouse gas
inventories notified to the European Commission and under the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, without taking into account international carbon offset credits164
Anthropogenic removals are the quantities of greenhouse gases absorbed by anthropogenic
ecosystems, i.e. natural environments managed by man (forests, grasslands, agricultural soils,
wetlands, etc.) and some industrial processes (carbon capture and storage or reuse)165. Carbon
neutrality corresponds to an emission factor of at least 6.
Illegal gold panning in forests: artisanal exploitation of gold alluvium to extract gold particles
made illegally in the forest.
Thermal sieve: term used to describe energy-intensive housing due to poor insulation and/or
energy efficiency.
Heat pump: a thermodynamic system that takes heat from a given medium at a low temperature
level and transfers it to another medium at a higher temperature level.
Global warming potential: an indicator measuring radiative forcing following the emission of a
mass unit of a given substance, using a given time frame relative to that of the reference
substance, carbon dioxide (CO ). It therefore represents the combined effect of these substances’
2
various residence times in the atmosphere and their radiative forcing capacity.166

synthetic methane following the combination of hydrogen and CO .
2
Fuel poverty:  situation in which a household is unable to guarantee a certain degree of
consumption of local energy services (heating in particular) or faces disproportionate expenses in
order to do so.167
Carbon sinks: a natural or artificial system used to capture and store a significant amount of
carbon dioxide (CO ) in order to limit the concentration thereof in the atmosphere.168 The forest
2
sector carbon sink includes the forest ecosystem and wood products.
Greenhouse gas emission allowance: unit of account allowing for the emission of a specific
amount of greenhouse gases based on a cap-and-trade system such as the European Union
Emission Trading Scheme.
Reconnu Garant de l’Environnement – RGE (recognised as environmentally friendly): a
label issued by a specialised body to guarantee the quality of the work of a craftsman or company
in the building sector when carrying out work to improve the energy performance of a dwelling.
Waste refusals: waste that during the waste treatment cycle is removed from said cycle because
it did not comply with the sorting centre’s specifications.
Modal shift: replacing a means of passenger or freight transport (generally road) with another that
is more environmentally friendly.169
Heat network: a communal system for several users or households that distributes heat from one
or more centralised heat production facilities.
Climate resilience: the resilience of a socio-ecological system in the face of external stresses or
dangerous events, allowing said system to respond or reorganize itself to maintain its essential
function, identity and structure, while maintaining its ability to adapt, learn and evolve.170
Extended Producer Responsibility: a  principle laid down at European level by Directive
75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975: “In accordance with the "polluter pays" principle, the cost of
disposing of waste [...] shall be borne by the holder who has waste handled by a waste collector or
by an undertaking [...], and/or the previous holders or the producer of the product from which the
waste came.” Article L. 541-10 of the French Environmental Code specifies stakeholder
responsibilities within the context of an EPR sector.171
Scope: the scope of greenhouse gas emissions to be taken into account during an inventory or
balance. Scope 1 corresponds to the direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by the
activity of an organisation or territory. Scope 2 takes into account GHG emissions associated with
the production of electricity, heat or steam that is imported and consumed by the organisation or
territory for its activities. Scope 3 refers to all other indirect emissions (other than indirect
emissions associated with Scope 2 energy) that are a consequence of the activities of the
organisation or territory but that stem from GHG sources controlled by other entities or located in
other jurisdictions (e.g., emissions from the production of purchased products or services,
emissions from transport and waste treatment, emissions from upstream freight transport, etc.).
Carbon sequestration: trapping (i.e. holding a potentially harmful substance within a reservoir)
carbon-containing substances, CO in particular, within terrestrial or marine reservoirs. This
2 
trapping can be biological in nature when it contributes to the direct elimination of CO  in the
2
atmosphere through land use change, afforestation, reforestation, revegetation, carbon storage in
landfills and agricultural practices that increase the carbon content of soils (cropland management,

storage (CCS) in some scientific publications.172
Energy sobriety: reduction of energy consumption through changes in behaviour.
Material or energy substitution: the use of biomass in place of other fossil fuel-based products,
therefore allowing for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The way this relates to the
national greenhouse gas emissions inventory by sector, is that substitution means reduced
emissions in other sectors, i.e. the industrial sector (cement, steel, aluminum, plastic) for material
substitution, and the energy production and residential/tertiary sectors for fossil fuel substitution.
LULUCF (Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry): a sector included in the greenhouse gas
inventory that groups together greenhouse gas emissions and removals resulting from human
activities directly related to land use, land use change (LUC) and forestry, excluding agricultural
emissions. See also Agriculture, forestry and other land uses (AFOLU).173
Shadow price of carbon: reference value defined at national level. This is most notably used for
the socio-economic evaluation of public investment choices. It is also intended to serve as a
reference  point   in  determining public policies,   such  as explicit   carbon  pricing  and  the
establishment of standards intended to guide private investment and change behaviours.
Waste-to-energy: using and processing waste in order to generate energy. This can be done via
incineration for the production of heat or electricity or via the anaerobic digestion of organic matter.
Material repurposing: recovery of some part of a waste material, whether for reuse, shifting its
primary use or recycling.
Non-interconnected areas: areas or regions that are not connected to the mainland metropolitan
electricity grid. This includes the DROMs and Corsica, as well as the Ponant Isles (Sein, Yeu, and
Ouessant).

National low carbon strategy - March 2020 166/176APPENDIX 10: CARBON SINKS
This appendix is a list of the strategic elements of the SNBC related to carbon sinks.
Achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 involves striking a balance between greenhouse gas
emissions and absorptions on the national territory.
Indeed, by 2050, by mobilising as much as possible the potential of each available lever to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, without, however, making technological bets, a certain level of
emissions seems incompressible, particularly in the non-energy sectors (agriculture in particular).
Achieving carbon neutrality therefore involves compensating for these emissions with carbon
sinks, such as:
 human-managed ecosystems (forests, farmland, etc.),
 products and materials from the bio-economy based on plant matter (wood, straw, etc.),
 industrial processes (carbon capture, use, and storage - see appendix 5. “CCUS”).
While ecosystems, commonly referred to as the "land sector", can store carbon, they can also
conversely release it, for example through land take or the conversion of permanent grassland to
ploughed land.
Therefore, in order to preserve and increase the sink of the land sector, the levers that can be
mobilised are: the fight against land take, especially land with the highest carbon stocks (e.g.
wetlands), agricultural practices that are conducive to strengthening the carbon stock of
agricultural soils (especially in arable areas where stocks are the lowest today174, such as
intermediate crops or agroforestry), improving forest management and boosting bio-based chains.
From a climate point of view, forestry management should aim to both adapt forests to climate
change and optimize climate change mitigation by taking the best account possible of the short-,
medium- and long-term effects. To do this we must first improve and strengthen the “carbon pump”
and subsequently increase wood harvesting while optimising the storage and substitution effects
of forests.
Carbon Capture, Use, and Storage (CCUS) technologies could contribute to the sinks via
anthropogenic capture and sequestration, depending on the potential available (see appendix 5.
“CCUS”).
1. Evolution of carbon sinks in the AMS scenario
In the scenario underlying the SNBC (AMS scenario - cf. chapter 2.2), the estimated total sink in
the land sector (forest and agricultural land) at optimal and sustainable performance, added to an
estimated capture and storage sink, would only allow us to balance these residual non-energy
emissions and the residual emissions from fossil fuels retained for part of the transport sector
(national air and international transport).
174 See INRA study “stocker du carbone dans les sols français – quel potentiel au regard de l'objectif 4 pour 1000 et à quel coût ?”
(“Storing carbon in French soils - what potential with regard to objective 4 per 1000 and at what cost?”) - July 2019
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 167/176Sinks and greenhouse gas emissions in France in 2050 according to the baseline scenario
The optimised mobilisation of carbon sinks is therefore an essential lever for achieving carbon
neutrality by 2050.
A.Sinks in the land sector
The forest contributes to the underlying SNBC scenario (AMS scenario) as a carbon sink in the
forest ecosystem, as a carbon sink in wood products, and through substitution effects through the
production of materials and energy that can substitute for more GHG-emitting materials and
energy.
In the “With Additional Measures” (AMS) scenario, intelligent and sustainable forest management
will allow us to progressively increase the carbon pump effect while improving forest resilience to
climate risks and better conserving biodiversity. The forest area will increase through afforestation.
Harvests will grow progressively from 48 Mm³ in 2015 to 65 Mm³ in 2030 and 83 Mm³ in 2050,
which will require significant efforts to reverse current trends, notably in private forests. Using
wood from forest land as a building material is highly recommended in comparison to using it for
energy purposes. The production of wood products with long lifespans (particularly for use in
construction) will triple between 2015 and 2050, which will increase the carbon sink of wood
products. Downstream, better collection of wood products at the end of their lifespan will allow us
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 168/176to increase the production of this type of biomass. Finally, the sink in the forest/wood sector will be
maintained despite the current decrease in the forest sink caused by an increase in harvests. This
will be achieved through the wood product sink and new forests.
The AMS scenario also assumes a slowing down of land take until "zero net land take" is reached
in 2050, and a very slight decrease in grasslands over time due to the increase in the share of
livestock reared outdoors.
Finally, agricultural land also contributes to the development of the French carbon sink, although
this contribution is only partially quantified in the current national inventory. The additional potential
could be better quantified thanks to the INRA study "Storing carbon in French soils - what potential
with regard to objective 4 per 1000 and at what cost? " of July 2019. The AMS scenario foresees
an improvement in practices on this lever, such as the development of agroforestry, simplified
ploughing techniques associated with more systematic soil cover via intermediate crops and
longer rotations.
The graph below shows the evolution of the sink of the land sector as a whole, encompassing
forest land as well as other land (crops, grasslands,  artificial  land...). Thanks to forest
management, an assumption of zero net land take in 2050 and taking into account the carbon
stored in agricultural land, this net sink increases between 2030 and 2050, after having changed
little between 2015 and 2030.

B.Carbon capture and storage technologies
Carbon capture and storage technologies (CCS) are also used, albeit prudently, in the baseline
scenario. In 2050, they will allow us to avoid around 6 MtCO /year in industry and to save around
2
ten MtCO  of emissions annually with energy production installations using biomass (BECCS).
2
That said, BECCS remains the only lever (alongside direct CO  capture from the atmosphere, but
2
it is at a very early stage of development) that may allow us to generate negative emissions in the
very long term (the forest storage eventually attaining an equilibrium in the very long term).
2. Strategic guidelines relating to the carbon sink
The following guidance is a selection from the policy chapters and is specific to or explicitly
mentions carbon sinks.  
A.Cross-sectoral guidelines
a) Economic policy chapter - Guideline ECO 1: send the right
signals to investors, particularly on carbon prices, and give
them a clear long-term view of climate policies
 [...]
 Take better account [...] of negative externalities such as pressure on surfaces and land take.
Negative externalities can be taken into account both through market signals and, if necessary,
through other economic (e.g. road-pricing) or regulatory instruments.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 170/176b) Research and Innovation chapter - Guideline R&I: develop low
carbon  innovations  using  basic  and  applied  research  and
facilitate their rapid dissemination
[...]
Increase public funding for R&D and calls for projects targeting the key levers of the transition
([...] sinks and technologies to store and use carbon).
c) Urban planning and development chapter - Guideline URB 1:
Containing land take and reducing carbon emissions caused
by urbanisation
Land take is a high-stake issue for attaining carbon neutrality. While the medium-term objective is
to continue to develop within the existing urban envelope175 without consuming new natural,
agricultural and forest areas, the long-term objective is to stop the net land take. The work
launched as part of the implementation of action 10 of the Government's biodiversity plan will
make it possible to define the time scale for achieving the "zero net land take" objective and the
means proposed to communities to achieve it.  The results will be incorporated into the next review
of the SNBC.
 Make the existing urban framework176 more dynamic by strengthening urban hubs and
rural villages, and revitalising areas that have lost their attraction. Develop regional
cooperation.
 Develop highly dense urban forms structured around transport routes, services, businesses
and jobs. Encourage different functions on a same plot of land to avoid urban sprawling.
Encourage households, businesses and artisans to move back into town centres.
Encourage the reselling of empty buildings and bring them up to standard to limit new
construction. Implement strong property policies to manage property prices and preserve
diversified uses.
 Optimize land use by industrial spaces, transport infrastructures and large infrastructures
(logistics, ports, airports etc.) that cannot be located in urban areas, and diversify their
uses. Promote shops in city centres before developing shops on the outskirts and optimise
the footprint of existing large commercial activity zones located outside city centres in line
with Action 12 of the biodiversity plan to modernise the regulatory framework and
governance relating to commercial development. Incorporate measures in the planning
documents encouraging the development of renewable energy, particularly in areas where
their impact on the landscape, soil quality, the functioning of the ecosystems and
biodiversity is limited.
 Stop the urban sprawl and degradation of agricultural, natural and forest areas and
encourage mixed uses: tourism, leisure, production, water regulation and purification,
preservation of biodiversity, etc. Limit or even stop the wetlands drying up. Promote the
inclusion of the preservation of soil ecosystem services in SRADDETs, including carbon
storage, by integrating them into the goals of preserving ecological continuity.
 In line with the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (PNACC)177: promote urban
forms that are resilient to the effects of climate change (reduce urban heat islands, limit the
effects of extreme climate events etc.); disseminate knowledge and feedback on nature-
based solutions.
175 Continuity of the urbanised space formed by the built fabric, the streets, public spaces, sports facilities and empty spaces in the
urban fabric
176 Rank towns and their areas of influence together
177 PNACC: Plan National d’Adaptation au Changement Climatique / National Climate Change Adaptation Plan
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 171/176 Limit excavation and soil sealing for urbanisation needs and promote the preservation of
the open land. Encourage companies to develop a chapter in their CSR (Corporate Social
Responsibility) reports on economising artificial and sealed soil surfaces.
Areas of concern:
 Urban intensity178 can lead to a feeling of overpopulation and can cause environmental
impacts (noise, air quality degradation, transport congestion etc.). It must therefore be
supported by research on improving the living environment and quality architectural design
(quality   landscaped  green  spaces,   innovation   in  housing  design,   maintenance  of
biodiversity, etc.).
 Limiting land take can boost property and land prices in attractive areas where services are
concentrated. The risk is then that poorer households are forced to move to the urban
fringes with bad public transport links or to areas more exposed to environmental
nuisances. Urban intensification should thus be accompanied by policies that foster social
diversity.
d) Employment, skills, qualifications and occupational training
chapter - Guideline PRO 1: Encourage better integration of the
low   carbon   transition   challenges   by   industrial   sectors,
businesses and territories in order to facilitate occupational
transitions   and   conversions   and   developing   future
employment.
 […]
 Supporting the renewal of the skills needed for the energy and climate transition in all sectors
of activity, particularly in the economic sectors most affected by the low-carbon transition in
their "core business", in particular [...] sectors linked to the development of the bio-economy
(agricultural sector, forest-land sector), The challenge is to support the widespread greening of
skills and the development of new professions, in a context of adaptation to climate change,
respect for biodiversity and contribution to the green economy (production of renewable
energies, bio-based materials, etc.).
A.Sectoral Guidelines
a) Building   sector   chapter   -   Guideline   B   2:   encourage   the
renovation of the whole existing residential housing stock and
tertiary   sector   buildings   to   attain   an   average   BBC   (low
consumption building) level throughout the stock
 [...]
 Develop use of the least carbonised renovation and insulation products and reimburse
materials contributing to the storage of atmospheric carbon in buildings.
b) Building sector chapter - Guideline B 3: improving the energy
and carbon performance levels of new buildings in future
environmental regulations
 […]
 Future regulations on new buildings must lead to an improvement of carbon reservoirs via
the storage of atmospheric carbon within building materials.
178 Densification bringing qualitative improvements in living space
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 172/176c) Agriculture chapter - Guideline A 3: developing low carbon
energy production and the bioeconomy in order to contribute
to  the  overall   reduction   of   CO   emissions  in   France  and
2
bolstering the added value of the agricultural sector
 Developing [...] the bioeconomy, such as the production of bio-based materials or
chemicals for their ability to replace materials of non-renewable origin179.
d) Agriculture chapter - Guideline A 4: ceasing carbon destocking
from agricultural soils and reversing the trend, in line with the
“4p1000, soils for food security and the climate” initiative
 Preserving permanent pastures
 Widely developing agroforestry, which will generate an additional income source for the
sector, as well as an additional source of biomass
 Increasing the input of crop residues and high quality organic matter into soils
 Developing agro-ecological crop practices that are favourable to carbon sequestration, in
particular by combining a reduced amount of tillage, permanent cover and longer crop
rotations, as well as developing grass buffer strips
 Preserving agricultural wetlands ;
Areas of concern:
 Soil carbon stocks should be either preserved or increased, while monitoring soil fertility
which is often but not always connected
 Increasing carbon in soil often implies a need for additional nitrogen, which must be taken
into account with the actions taken
 Most of the time, a saturation effect on soil sequestration dynamics takes place after a few
decades
 Gains are reversible (natural disasters, changes in land use or changes in climatic
conditions that could lead to heightened soil CO  emissions)
2
 Producing biomass allowing for soil carbon inputs depends on the crops’ ability to adapt to
climate change, and on water needs and availability in particular.
e) Agriculture chapter - Guideline A 6: improving inventory and
monitoring methodologies
 Developing inventory methodologies allowing for better analysis of good practices,
technical progress and innovations
 Encouraging the development of monitoring and evaluation methodologies for private or
public promotion of environmental services or progress made.
Areas of concern:
 Current inventory methodologies sometimes come with a great deal of uncertainty ([...]soil
carbon, [...]). This should not hinder action in anticipation of improvement, and should
favour actions with co-benefits.
f) Forest-Land chapter - Guideline F 1: ensuring the long-term
preservation and strengthening of forestry sector carbon sinks
179 As part of the bioeconomy strategy.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 173/176and stocks and their resistance to climatic stress
 Improving the “carbon pump” and reducing the risk of damage from natural hazards
(storms, fires, droughts, phytosanitary attacks etc.), via improved forestry management
with a particular focus on adapting forests to deal with climate change. Forestry
management must also aim to preserve forest soil carbon stocks. Research and
development work in this area is necessary.
 Developing afforestation while considering the ecological implications of newly forested
land (biodiversity preservation, landscape concerns etc.).
 Preserving forested areas by reducing clearing.
 Improving the observation and statistical monitoring of forest soil carbon content.
g) Forest-Land chapter - Guideline F 2: maximising the effects of
substitution and carbon storage in wood products by altering
supply and demand
 Harvesting more wood (increasing marketed wood by 12Mm³ per year by 2026, and
continuing this increase180 with +0.8Mm³ per year from 2036) via forest management and
wood mobilisation incentives while ensuring that biodiversity is preserved.
 Prioritising uses of wood that have a longer life span and high substitution potential
(expanded use of wood in construction). Developing the eco-design of wooden buildings.
 Bolstering the carbon efficiency of the use of wood resources (improving energy efficiency
for wood energy and improving the carbon footprint of wood products).
 Developing the reuse, recycling and waste-to-energy use of end-of-life wood products.
h) Forest-Land   chapter   -   Guideline   F   3:   evaluating   the
implementation   of   active   policies   and   frequently   adjusting
them accordingly to guarantee that the expected results and
co-benefits materialize
 Taking part in an “ongoing” evaluation partnership starting in 2019, serving to monitor and
control the economic, environmental and social effects of increased wood removal. Having
the forest/wood sector work closely with the Plateforme de la Biodiversité pour la Forêt
(PBF - “Forest Biodiversity Platform”) for its management.
i) Industry chapter - Guideline I 2: Taking part, now, in developing
and adopting disruptive technologies with the aim of reducing
and possibly eliminating residual emissions
 […]
 Supporting the development of pilot and potentially commercial carbon capture and storage
(CCS) and carbon capture and use (CCU) units, with the use of CO  as a raw material in
2
fuel or chemical production. Combined with a biomass energy production facility, carbon
storage generates negative emissions, which is to be strongly supported when resources
are used efficiently and the whole sector is sustainable. Supporting research and public
policies for the supervision of potential risks associated with these technologies, e.g.
preventing potential carbon “leaks” into the atmosphere connected to carbon capture and
storage units.
180 This is a progressive dynamic management scenario. This increase will continue at the same rate until 2035 (as in the study IGN-
FCBA (2016), Disponibilités forestières pour l'énergie et les matériaux à l'horizon 2035 - “Forestry resources for energy and
materials by 2035”) then will increase in moderation until 2050.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 174/176 Ensuring consistent carbon accounting so that these new technologies are suitably taken
into account, making sure to distinguish between fossil carbon and biogenic carbon.
National low carbon strategy - March 2020 175/176APPENDIX 11: THE ANTI-WASTE LAW FOR A CIRCULAR ECONOMY
The anti-waste law for a circular economy, which has been voted on at the beginning of 2020, is
based on 4 main guidelines:
 Putting an end to the various forms of waste in order to preserve natural resources,
in particular by banning the destruction of non-food products, the obligation to donate
unsold food products, the development of bulk sales, the end of overpackaging of fruit and
vegetables as of 2022 and that of disposable tableware for on-site catering as of 2023, the
creation of new channels with extended producer responsibility, etc.
 Strengthening consumer  information  so that consumers can make informed
choices, in particular by creating a repairability index and a durability index for certain
equipment, a stronger framework for advertising, creating maps of repair and reuse
services, etc.
 Mobilising economic players to transform production and distribution methods, in
particular by rolling out a deposit system from 2023, a bonus-malus system on eco-
contribution, strong restrictions on the free distribution of plastic bottles, the use of plastics
that break down into small pieces or microplastics, etc.
 Improving waste collection and sorting and fighting against illegal dumping, in
particular by progressively standardising sorting instructions and selective collection bins
throughout the territory, by making sorting rules simpler, extending the collection of used
products in stores, the sharp increase in the number of collection points for building waste
with free collection when this waste is sorted, standardising bio-waste sorting for better
recovery, strengthening the tools of elected officials in the fight against illegal dumping...
All of the measures contained in this bill therefore aim to bring about concrete changes whose
effects will be observable in the short term, but also a more structural, in-depth change in the way
of conceiving the modes of production, consumption and management and recovery of products,
equipment and waste. This is therefore a first major and cross-cutting step in the legislative
implementation of the SNBC.
