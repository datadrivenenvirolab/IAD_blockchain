Summary
The Paris Agreement encourages Parties to formulate and communicate long-term low 
greenhouse gas emission development strategies. This document enfolds Iceland’s 
first communication on its long-term strategy (LTS), to be updated when further 
analysis and policy documents are published on the matter. 
Iceland is committed to reducing its overall greenhouse gas emissions and reaching
climate neutrality no later than 2040 and become fossil fuel free in 2050, which should 
set Iceland on a path to net negative emissions. The goal of net zero emissions no later 
than 2040 was enacted into the Climate Act in June 2021, based on the Government 
Agreement from 2017.
Iceland has submitted an updated nationally determined contribution under the Paris 
Agreement, enhancing its commitment to at least 55% net greenhouse gas emissions 
reduction by 2030 compared to 1990, to be achieved by acting jointly with the European 
Union and its Member States and Norway.
In this document the foundation and various milestones that have been reached 
on the path to climate neutrality are described. Key documents and policies are 
introduced, such as Iceland’s Climate Action Plan for emissions reduction of 40% 
by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, which was published in 2020, and Iceland’s Energy 
Policy to 2050 that is based on the vision for sustainable energy future and aims 
towards a fossil fuel free future, where all energy production is of renewable origin 
in 2050. Insight is given into context and framing of overarching climate targets and 
commitments. 
Iceland’s emissions profile is in many ways unique and carbon sequestration in soil 
and vegetation will be a key measure to achieve climate neutrality. Thus, Iceland’s 
approach to land use measures is of special importance. Iceland is working on 
extensive improvements in measurements and accounting of emissions and carbon 
sequestration to improve the knowledge base and minimise uncertainty in the LULUCF 
sector. 
Icelandic authorities are supportive of innovation when it comes to new technology, 
such as exploring possibilities for carbon capture and storage. Attention is also being 
paid to adaptation planning to develop synergies between adaptation measures and 
mitigation measures. Iceland is currently developing a national adaptation plan based 
on Iceland’s first adaptation strategy, adopted in September 2021.
6On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
For a society to reach the goal of climate neutrality all hands must be on deck and 
new strategies and measures need to be put in place to reach the target. It requires 
engagement of different groups of stakeholders and cooperation across governmental 
actors, industry partners, non-governmental organisations and municipalities. This 
includes public participation in building a robust strategy to ensure a just transition 
to a circular, competitive, climate neutral future.
In this document, a quick introduction is given to a stakeholder engagement study 
that took place in 2021 on pathways to a climate neutral Iceland in 2040. Scenarios 
on several pathways were modelled by a team of researchers based on the views and 
opinions expressed by participants in a stakeholder survey. 
The transition to a climate neutral society requires strong commitment, planning and 
investment on all fronts. A climate neutral society will require reducing all emissions, 
keeping in mind their different sources and the variety of solutions applicable to each 
sector. Therefore it is likely that the way forward will be a combined set of different 
sectoral strategies and measures. The strategy needs to be flexible and to allow for 
new innovative solutions that might be found on the path to climate neutrality. The 
next step is to further the discussion on how to reach climate neutrality, e.g. using the 
results from the stakeholder study. 
A just path to climate neutrality should involve all sectors, different stakeholders and 
the general public in the discussion and the decision making. 
7On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
1. Introduction
The primary goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit the increase in the global average 
temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts 
to limit the temperature increase to 1,5°C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris 
Agreement further stipulates that, to attain these objectives, it will be necessary 
‘to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals 
by sinks of greenhouse gases’, that is net zero emissions, in the second half of 
this century. Recent scientific reports have further evidenced the importance of 
immediate and long-term climate action.1
The Paris Agreement encourages Parties to formulate and communicate long-term 
low greenhouse gas emission development strategies. This document is Iceland’s first 
communication on its long-term climate strategy. Iceland is committed to reducing its 
overall greenhouse gas emissions and reaching climate neutrality no later than 2040 
and become fossil fuel free in 2050, which should set Iceland on a path to net negative 
emissions. The goal of net zero emissions no later than 2040 was enacted into the 
Climate Act in June 2021, based on the Government Agreement from 2017. 
Foundation has been laid for the long-term strategy and various milestones have 
been reached on the path towards the long-term goal of climate neutrality. A key 
document is Iceland’s Climate Action Plan for emissions reduction of 40% by 2030, 
compared to 2005 levels, which was published in 2020. Carbon sequestration in soil 
and vegetation will be a key measure to achieve climate neutrality both in Iceland 
and globally, but also in technical solutions such as carbon sequestration, utilisation 
and mineralisation. Thus, Iceland’s approach to land use measures is of special 
importance because of the country’s unique land use emissions profile.
Iceland’s Energy Policy to 20502 is based on the vision for sustainable energy and 
aims towards a fossil fuel free future, where all energy production is of renewable 
origin in 2050.
The success of the transition to a climate neutral society ultimately depends on the 
harmonious cooperation of many different actors. The challenge for the Government 
is to get a grip on this complexity, starting with a clarification of the supervision, 
roles and responsibilities of the national Government, local governments, private

and public parties, and citizens. It will also involve a search for new methods of 
cooperation, both between the various levels of government and between the 
Government and civil society parties.
Analyses of how policy, instruments and measures promote a low-emission pathway 
up to 2050 are extremely important, bearing in mind the goal of climate neutrality 
no later than 2040. The first steps towards an analysis of measures and instruments 
have been taken and show that there are multiple pathways for achieving Iceland’s 
climate neutral target for 2040. 
The task ahead is to integrate these various policies and action plans towards the 
further reaching common goal of climate neutrality. The main objective will be 
to develop a sound scientific basis for a framework for a long-term low emission 
development pathway in relevant sectors in Iceland, in line with its goals. The work 
ahead will outline pathways towards a low emission society and choices that can be 
made to promote a low emission pathway.
Stakeholder engagement and public consultation will be playing a pivotal role. 
Therefore, the long-term strategy communicated in this document should be seen 
as an initial step, to be revisited regularly. 
An overview of the main milestones that have been reached since 2017 on Iceland’s 
path towards climate neutrality in 2040 are shown in the timeline below.

2. Climate Neutral Iceland 2040
The global goal of a climate neutral future is the only option in terms of constructing 
a viable, forward-looking and prosperous society, leaving no one behind.
Iceland is committed to reducing its overall greenhouse gas emissions and in June 
2021 the goal on climate neutrality no later than 2040 was enacted into the Climate 
Act, based on the Government Agreement from 2017.
More than one path can be taken towards a climate neutral future and there is more 
than one way to imagine a climate neutral society. A key aspect is the implementation 
and adoption of various measures to curb emissions. Climate neutrality will not be 
achieved only by a rapid decrease in emissions; increased carbon sequestration is 
necessary. A just transition, to a climate neutral society can only be achieved with 
all of society reaping the benefits.
Emissions from all major sectors, including energy, industry, transport, buildings and 
agriculture, land use and forestry will have to be reduced. In order to achieve climate 
neutrality, it is paramount to reduce emissions rapidly, but it is also clear that 
nature-based solutions with improved land use, increased ecosystem restoration 
and forestry will play an important role. Carbon sequestration in soil and vegetation 
will be a key measure to achieve climate neutrality both in Iceland and globally, but 
also through technical solutions such as carbon capture and storage, utilisation and 
mineralisation. 
2.1 Context and framing
2.1.1 National circumstances
Iceland is a constitutional republic with a multi-party parliamentary system of 
government. The Constitution was adopted on 17 June 1944, when the Republic was 
established. Legislative power is vested in Parliament (Althingi) and the president, 
in that bills of legislation are passed by Parliament and submitted to the president 
for confirmation by his or her signature. Upon such confirmation, the bill in question 
acquires the force of law. The Government must be supported by a majority of 
Parliament in order to remain in power. The president is the head of state and is 
elected for a term of four years by a direct vote of the electorate. 
16On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
Iceland is located in the North Atlantic between Norway, Scotland and Greenland. 
It is the second-largest island in Europe and the third largest in the Atlantic Ocean, 
with a land area of some 103 thousand square kilometres, a coastline of 4,970 
kilometres and a 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone extending over 758 
thousand square kilometres in the surrounding waters. 
Figure 1. Geographic location of Iceland.
Iceland is situated just south of the Arctic Circle. The mean temperature is 
considerably higher than might be expected at this latitude. Relatively mild winters 
and cool summers characterize Iceland’s oceanic climate. The average monthly 
temperature varies from -3 to +3 °C in January and from +8 to +15°C in July. Storms and 
rain are frequent, with annual precipitation ranging from 400 to 4000 mm on average 
annually, depending on location. The mild climate stems from the Gulf Stream and 
17On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
attendant warm ocean currents from the Gulf of Mexico. The weather is also affected 
by polar currents from East Greenland that travel southeast towards the coastline 
of the northern and eastern part of Iceland.
The population of Iceland was around 364 thousand on 1 January 2020. With 3 inhabitants 
per square kilometre, Iceland is the least densely populated country in Europe. In 2000–
2015, annual average population growth was 1.1%. Around 64% of the population (almost 
235 thousand) live in the capital city of Reykjavík and its surrounding municipalities. 
Figure 2 shows Iceland’s population 1990-2020 and three scenarios for population 
growth until 2050. The low estimate predicts that the population will reach almost 
390 thousand in 2050, the medium estimate predicts 431 thousand and the high 
estimate predicts that the population will reach almost 480 thousand in 2050.3

2.1.2 Overarching climate targets and commitments 
Iceland’s climate commitments relate to both the national targets on the path to a 
climate neutral society, defined in the Climate Act, and international commitments 
of reducing greenhouse gas emissions jointly with the European Union (EU) and its 
Member states and Norway in accordance with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. 
In October 2019 the EU, Iceland and Norway formally agreed to cooperate on reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions to reach the target of the Paris Agreement. 
The agreement was set out in Joint Committee Decision No 269/2019, and stated that 
Iceland and Norway would be part of a collective delivery by European countries 
to reach a target of 40% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared 
to 1990 levels and apply the key pieces of EU climate legislation accordingly. The 
agreement entails that a) Iceland will continue participation in the EU Emissions 
Trading Scheme and b) a target for emissions outside the EU-ETS will be set by the 
same methodology as applied to EU Member States. The target for Iceland within 
the collective delivery has been set at 29%. The intention to deliver the target in 
cooperation with the EU is stated in Iceland’s first NDC.
In February 2021, Iceland submitted an updated nationally determined contribution 
under the Paris Agreement, enhancing its commitment to at least 55% net greenhouse 
gas emissions reduction by 2030 compared to 1990, to be achieved by acting jointly 
with the EU and its Member States and Norway. A target for emissions outside the EU 
ETS will be set by the same methodology as applied to EU Member States. The target 
for Iceland within the collective delivery of 55% has not been set. 
The EU’s climate policy is based on three pieces of legislation: 1) the Emissions 
Trading System (EU ETS), which is included in the EEA Agreement, 2) the Effort Sharing 
Regulation for emissions that fall outside the EU ETS, and 3) the Land Use, Land Use 
Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation. 
Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) No 2018/842
Under this regulation Iceland is committed to a reduction of 29% in non-ETS emissions 
in the period 2021-2030, relative to 2005. The target for the commitment period will be 
divided into annual targets, expressed in annual emissions allocation (AEA). 
Annual greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets from non-ETS activities for 
Iceland for the period from 2021 to 2030 were set in 2020 by using the latest available 
greenhouse gas inventory data for 2005, 2016, 2017, and 2018 and after the European 
Commission’s implementing act referred to in Article 4 of Regulation 2018/842 was 
adopted.
19On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
LULUCF Regulation, No 2018/841
LULUCF stands for land use, land use change and forestry and covers emissions 
by sources and removals by sinks in the land sector. Credits obtained under this 
Regulation can be used to reach the target for the non-ETS sector in accordance with 
the ESR up to a certain limit. The limit for Iceland is 0.2 million credits from LULUCF.
Commitments and greenhouse gas emissions and accounting rules in the LULUCF 
sector for the period after 2020 are laid down by Regulation 2018/841, adopted into 
the EEA Agreement in accordance with the Decision of the EEA Joint Committee No 
269/2019. 
According to Article 4 of the Regulation, Iceland, making use of the provided 
flexibilities, shall ensure that the amount of greenhouse gas emissions accounted 
according to the accounting rules laid down in the Regulation does not exceed the 
amount of greenhouse gas removals accounted in accordance with the LULUCF 
Regulation. 
The European Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) 
As a party to the EEA Agreement, Iceland participates in the European Emission 
Trading Scheme (ETS) which covers greenhouse gas emissions from stationary 
installations and aviation operators. Emissions that fall outside of the ETS, and 
relevant climate-related regulations, do not fall under the provisions of the EEA 
Agreement. Under the revised EU ETS Directive, there are no differentiated caps by 
country as there is one single EU ETS cap that covers the EU Member States and the 
three participating non-EU Member States, the EFTA-states Norway, Iceland and 
Liechtenstein. 
For allowances allocated to the EU ETS sectors, annual caps were set for the third 
trading period from 2013 to 2020; these decrease by 1.74% annually, starting from 
the average level of allowances issued by Member States for the second trading 
period (2008 to 2012). The annual caps imply interim targets for emissions reduction 
in sectors covered by the EU ETS for each year until 2020. Within the cap, companies 
receive or buy emission allowances, which they can trade with one another as 
needed. For the fourth trading period (2021 to 2030) the cap on emissions continues 
to decrease annually at an increased annual linear reduction rate of 2.2% annually. 
Operators can also buy limited amounts of international credits from emission-
saving projects around the world. The limit on the total number of allowances 
available ensures that they have a value. After each year a company must surrender 
enough allowances to cover all its emissions, otherwise heavy fines are imposed. If a 
company reduces its emissions, it can keep the spare allowances to cover its future 
needs or else sell them to another company that is short of allowances.

2.1.3 Iceland’s emissions profile – historical perspective
Iceland’s emissions profile is in many ways unusual. Almost all heating and electric-
ity generation is provided for by renewables; hydro- and geothermal energy. The 
biggest source of emissions (not counting LULUCF) is industrial processes, mainly 
from aluminium and ferrosilicon production, that fall under the EU ETS. In 2019 38% 
of Iceland’s emissions, without LULUCF, fell under the EU EST. Other sectors with 
the highest share of emissions were road transport, agriculture, fisheries and waste 
management (see Figure 3).
Detailed information on Iceland’s greenhouse gas emissions and removal is available 
in Iceland’s submitted 2021 National Inventory Report (NIR)4. Iceland’s total green-
house gas emissions in 2019 were 4,722 kt. carbon dioxide equivalents (COe) without 
2
LULUCF, and 13,794 kt. COe with LULUCF.

21On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
Total greenhouse gas emissions, excluding LULUCF, increased by approximately a 
third since 1990, mostly due to the expansion of the metal production industry. 
Emissions from the energy sector were dominated by fuel combustion in road 
transport and fishing, whereas the emissions due to electricity production and 
district heating were relatively small and almost exclusively linked to CO emissions 
2
from geothermal power plants. Annual emissions have seen an overall decline 
since 1990 from commercial fishing, with CO emissions reducing by approximately 
2
a quarter over the time series. Emissions from both domestic flights and navigation 
have also declined since 1990.
Energy: Iceland ranks first among OECD countries in the per capita consumption of 
primary energy. However, the proportion of domestic renewable energy in the total 
energy budget is approximately 85%, which is a much higher share than in most 
other countries, with close to 100% of the energy demand covered by hydrothermal-, 
geothermal- and wind energy. The cool climate and sparse population call for high 
energy use and transport. Together with road transport, fisheries also dominate 
emissions in the energy sector.
Industrial Processes: Emissions from industrial processes and product use in Iceland 
fall mostly under the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS), where the main sources 
are aluminium and ferroalloy production. The availability of renewable energy like 
hydropower in Iceland allows the metal industry to lower emissions of CO per ton of 
2
metal produced compared to the use of fossil fuels for energy generation. About 15% 
of emissions in this sector are in the form of fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases). 
22On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
Agriculture: Emissions are dominated by agricultural soils and enteric fermentation 
across the time series. Approximately 60% of emissions from enteric fermentation 
are from cattle, whereas the second and third most significant livestock categories 
are sheep and horses.
Waste: Emissions from waste increased from 1990 to 2007 due to solid waste 
disposal and increased composting, and then decreased to reach similar levels of 
1990. Emissions from waste are dominated by solid waste disposal and wastewater 
treatment activities.
LULUCF: Overall, the LULUCF sector results in net emissions which are greater that all 
other sectors combined. This is primarily due to emissions from grassland, wetlands 
and cropland. LULUCF emissions have remained relatively constant since 1990.

Estimates of LULUCF emissions are subject to great uncertainty, higher than for any 
other sector of emissions. The uncertainty applies both to the assessment of emis-
sions and sequestration. 
Emissions from land use, changed land use and forestry in Iceland are proportionally 
high in total emissions compared to other countries. It will be important to elabo-
rate on this aspect in relation to climate neutrality when more knowledge becomes 
available. In order to address this uncertainty, extensive work is being undertaken 
(see section 3.2). 
2.1.4 Scope
Setting a goal of reaching climate neutrality requires a concise description of key 
parameters: sectors, gases, benchmarks, accounting rules, timeframe etc. Designing 
the path to reach the goal of net zero emissions within a few decades is bound to be 
a huge undertaking for almost any country, and it will require ambitious and effective 
measures to reach that goal. However, It is important that the parameters associated 
with the goal are clearly defined and transparent. 
Iceland’s goal of climate neutrality extends to the seven greenhouse gases consistent 
with the Paris Agreement. To achieve net zero emissions, it is considered necessary 
to significantly reduce all of them. 
They are as follows: 
•  Carbon dioxide - CO 
2
•  Methane - CH 
4
•  Nitrous oxide - NO 
2
•  Hydrofluorocarbons - HFCs 
•  Perfluorocarbons - PFCs 
•  Sulphur hexafluoride - SF 
6
•  Nitrogen trifluoride - NF
3
24On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
In national emissions accounting, emissions and sequestration are divided into the 
following sectors according to their source. All the sectors fall under Iceland’s goal 
of climate neutrality: 
1.  Energy 
2.  Industrial processes and chemical / product use (IPPU) 
3.  Agriculture
4.  Waste 
5.  Land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF)
As stated above, it is important to elaborate on the high proportion of LULUCF 
emissions in total emissions in Iceland and the significant uncertainty of their 
estimate in defining the path towards net zero emissions.

3. Iceland’s Climate 
Policies and measures
Iceland’s mitigation measures seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while 
ensuring sustainable growth and a just transition and providing synergies with other 
environmental goals, such as improving air quality, a circular economy, and protecting 
biodiversity.
The Climate Action Plan is Iceland’s main instrument to reach its commitments under 
the Paris Agreement, specifically its emissions reduction goals for 2030. The plan is 
also intended to help reach the Government’s ambitious aim to make Iceland climate 
neutral no later than 2040. 
A road to climate neutrality relies on an array of crosscutting policies, such as 
Iceland’s recent Waste Management Plan and Waste Prevention Program which 
promote a circular economy.5 The transition is already underway with the 
participation of different stakeholders and growing public awareness.
3.1 Iceland’s Climate Action Plan
The Icelandic Government presented a new Climate Action Plan in September 2018. 
The Action Plan was a watershed, as it was the first long-term comprehensive 
plan that was fully funded, with substantial increase in government funding of 
key measures in climate mitigation. An updated version of the Climate Action 
Plan was presented in June 2020, containing new and elaborated measures and 
increased funding. The updated Action Plan also contained significantly improved 
analysis to estimate the individual and collective mitigation gains of the measures 
presented. All in all, the Climate Action Plan now contains 50 measures aimed at 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon sequestration. The updated 
Action Plan reflected comments and suggestions received, and the conclusions of 
a consultation process with stakeholders and civil society. Emphasis is placed on 
implementing measures immediately; in 2021 all but 3 measures have already been 
set in motion.
Emphasis is placed on a rapid clean energy transition in transport and increased 
efforts in the LULUCF sector, where Iceland has great mitigation potential in 
5 Iceland’s Waste management Plan and Waste Prevention Program. 2021. https://www.stjornarradid.is/
library/02-Rit--skyrslur-og-skrar/Stefna%20um%20me%C3%B0h%C3%B6ndlun%20%C3%BArgangs%202021- 27
2032%20090621.pdfOn the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
afforestation, revegetation and wetland reclamation. There is special emphasis on 
measures in these two fields, rationalised by the fact that Iceland has significant 
mitigation potential in these fields and by economic findings showing that measures 
in these fields are cost efficient. Iceland has already achieved an almost complete 
energy transformation from fossil fuels to renewables in electricity production and 
heating and now there are technological options for electrification of transport, 
of which Iceland is well placed to take advantage, with an ample supply of 
electricity from renewables. Iceland has great potential for carbon sequestration by 
afforestation and revegetation, and possibilities to stop legacy emissions inter alia 
from drained wetlands. 
The Climate Action Plan addresses all major sources and sinks, and outlines climate 
mitigation measures in transport, fisheries, energy, industry, chemicals, agriculture, 
waste management and LULUCF. Part of the plan’s approach to emissions from 
industry involves compliance with the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol 
to phase down the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) which Iceland 
ratified in 2021.
According to analysis, measures in the updated version of the Climate Action Plan 
will lead to a decrease of emissions in 2030 by more than one million tons of CO 
2
equivalents compared to 2005 in sectors that fall under the EU Effort Sharing 
Regulation –(ESR): transport, agriculture, fisheries, waste management etc. This 
means that Iceland should meet its current climate commitments for a 29% reduction 
in ESR emissions from 2005 levels, as analysis indicates that Iceland should be able 
to reduce emissions in these sectors by 35% by implementing the actions outlined in 
the Plan. In addition to this, actions currently in preparation are estimated to result 
in an additional cut in emissions of 5-11%, for a total decrease of 40-46%. 
28On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
With the 2020 Climate Action Plan Iceland expects to achieve a substantial reduction  
in greenhouse gas emissions — still greater reduction is aimed at through additional  
measures currently in preparation.

Figure 5. Iceland’s historical greenhouse gas emissions that fall under the Effort Sharing Regulation to 2018, and 
projected emissions in 2030 without the Action Plan, with the Action Plan and measures currently in preparation.
Because climate change respects neither borders nor emissions accounting, it is 
important to address greenhouse gas emissions regardless of their sources and 
nature of commitments. The Action Plan takes this into consideration and aims 
to address all significant sources and sinks. Figure 7 shows the expected success 
of the measures and how they relate to Iceland’s commitments. For instance, 
under land use, carbon sequestration and wetlands restoration will lead to greatly 
increased benefits, more than 500% compared to 2005 levels. These measures play 
an important role in achieving Iceland’s goal of climate neutrality no later than 2040.

In addition, many parties at national level other than the Government have taken 
initiatives in combating climate change: municipalities, private sector companies and 
other actors. These initiatives are expected to result in a reduction in greenhouse 
gas emissions in Iceland’s emissions accounting. Supporting such initiatives is 
important as government actions alone will not suffice to successfully counter 
climate change. 
The Action Plan takes into account the UN Sustainable Development Goals, which 
were universally adopted in September 2015, and require the participation and 
cooperation of numerous and diverse stakeholders. As technology advances rapidly, 
new and more cost effective ways to reduce emissions can be expected to emerge. 
The Climate Action Plan must therefore be in continuous development.
The Action Plan will be assessed in terms of its impact on different income groups 
and analysed in terms of costs and benefits, including the macroeconomic impacts 
of measures. It is important to ensure that climate action supports efforts towards 
a just transition.

The Climate Act ensures regular follow-up on the Government’s climate effort. 
According to the Climate Act the Government shall, in consultation with stakeholders, 
review and update the Climate Action Plan every fourth year, based on international 
commitments and the Government’s goals. Climate measures shall be developed and 
put in motion by an inter-ministerial committee. The committee shall also prepare 
a yearly progress report on the status of implementation of the climate plan and 
its measures, emissions development and whether or not the development is in 
accordance with the Climate Plan. 
3.2 Land use measures
LULUCF is a cornerstone in Iceland’s climate mitigation policy and a key element of 
Iceland’s Climate Action Plan6. The LULUCF sector is a key to Iceland’s climate neutrality 
2040 goal, and in 2019 the Icelandic Government published a LULUCF mitigation plan7 
outlining specific LULUCF policies and measures to be taken in the period up to 2022. 
Iceland’s climate measures emphasise the reduction of emissions and the increase 
of carbon sequestration in land use by the restoration of woodlands and wetlands, 
revegetation, and afforestation. These measures play a role in Iceland meeting the 2030 
commitments, but also an important role in achieving Iceland’s goal of climate neutrality 
by 2040.
Iceland is working on extensive improvements in measurements and accounting 
of emissions and carbon sequestration in the LULUCF sector. In September 2021 an 
improvement plan on measures to be taken to improve Iceland’s greenhouse gas 
inventory was published.  Improved scientific knowledge and accounting should provide 
more accurate estimates and improve the knowledge base for estimating the effect 
of different policies and measures and thereby provide a better basis for long-term 
projections.
3.3 Carbon capture and storage
In March 2021, a legislation that transposes the EU Directive 2009/31/EC of carbon 
capture and storage into Icelandic legislation, was passed by the parliament of Iceland, 
Alþingi.  In June 2019 the Government and heads of heavy industry operators in Iceland 
signed a declaration of intent to explore possibilities for carbon capture and storage 
of industrial emissions based on the collaborative research project CarbFix that is led

in Iceland aims to enable the use of the CCS opportunities in order to reach climate 
neutrality.
3.4 Energy Policy to 2050
In the beginning of October 2020, the Icelandic Government presented a new Energy 
Policy to 20508 based on the vision for a sustainable energy future. Amongst other 
things, the vision states that in 2050 all energy production will be of renewable origin. 
Energy use should be sustainable in a way that benefits society and the public in general. 
Iceland should be leading in sustainable energy production and clean energy transition. 
Consensus should be achieved on the balance between nature protection and utilisation 
of energy resources.
Iceland’s Energy Policy to 2050 main aims are:
•  Energy needs are fulfilled
•  Infrastructure is solid and shock-resistant 
•  More diverse energy system 
•  Iceland is independent of fossil fuels; clean energy transition on land, at 
sea and in the air
•  Improved energy efficiency and energy loss minimized 
•  Resource streams are multi-use
•  Nature conservation is taken into account in energy utilization
•  Environmental impact is minimized 
•  Sustainable utilization of energy resources
•  The nation benefits from energy resources
•  Energy market is active and competitive
•  Equal access to energy throughout the country

3.5 A transition to a circular economy
Iceland’s Waste Prevention Program (2016-2027) and Waste Management Plan (2021-
2032) are important mechanisms on the road to climate neutrality. One of the five 
core goals of the Waste Prevention Program is to cut greenhouse gas emissions with 
ongoing and pipelined focus areas with clear mitigation co-benefits, e.g. food waste, 
textile sustainability, and sustainable construction. Moreover, a pillar of the Waste 
Management Plan is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from waste and to work 
towards a climate neutral Iceland.
Iceland has already seen a significant reduction in emissions from waste management 
through a decrease in the use of landfills, increased recycling and rise in the use of 
methane from landfills.
3.6 Climate change adaptation
Building the climate resilience of societies and ecosystems is a part of the big picture 
vision for a climate neutral Iceland not later than 2040. Iceland emphasises nature-
based solutions which help build climate resilience for communities and ecosystems 
vulnerable to for instance climate-induced natural hazards.
Iceland is currently developing its first national adaptation plan based on a white 
paper on climate change adaptation and Iceland’s first adaptation strategy.9 One 
of Iceland’s policy aims and an objective for its adaptation planning is to develop 
synergies between adaptation measures and mitigation measures. Figure 8 captures 
the potential for such synergies with mitigation measures on the right side of the 
x-axis and adaptation measures on the top part of the y-axis, creating an area in the 
top right corner representing exceptionally beneficial measures with either mitigation 
or adaptation co-benefits. Iceland has identified nature-based solutions as one of the 
main opportunities to facilitate such synergies. Thus, a part of Iceland’s long-term goal 
for net zero emissions is the strategic implementation of adaptation measures with 
mitigation co-benefits.

3.7 National consultation processes
Public consultation is a key element in decision and policy making in Iceland and is 
conducted in numerous ways. To increase transparency and opportunities for the public 
and stakeholders to participate in policy making, regulatory work or public decision 
making, the Government uses an online consultation portal. Additionally, various other 
types of consultation processes are used such as informal and formal meetings with key 
stakeholders, brainstorming sessions, participation of stakeholders in committee work, 
direct invitation to comment during different work phases etc. 
For instance, the recently added provisions to the Climate Act, legally formalising 
Iceland’s goal for climate neutrality, were welcomed in stakeholder submissions to the 
consultation portal along with useful discussions and suggestions for its implementation. 
36On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
In 2020, Iceland’s Climate Council published a discussion paper on the Government’s 
intent to aim for net zero emissions. The Climate Council was established in 2018 and 
was given a legal basis with an amendment to the Icelandic Climate Act in 2019. The 
Council members are various stakeholders from different economic sectors, civil society, 
and academia and the Council has the status of an independent body whose role is 
to hold authorities accountable and provide advice on policy objectives and specific 
measures related to climate change. According to the Climate Act, the Climate Council 
shall inter alia review, at the stage of preparation, the Government’s climate-related 
plans, and thus it represents an important formalised avenue for policy consultation. 
Another platform for discussions on Iceland’s goal for climate neutrality is Green by 
Iceland, established in 2019 by the Government and the Icelandic business sector for 
cooperation on climate issues and green solutions.  
In addition to the above consultation processes, Iceland’s path to climate neutrality 
has been informed by a stakeholder engagement study, which was initiated by the 
Government and carried out by a team of researchers. A random sample of Icelandic 
individuals were invited to participate in a survey and group workshops on climate 
change and mitigation in order to inform system dynamic modelling for the visualisation 
of different ways for Iceland to reach net zero emissions. The objective and outputs 
of the study are further elaborated in section 4, but the Government aims to further 
expand participation of different stakeholders in the strategic work in order to create 
a common vision describing the different measures needed and their implications for 
Iceland. 
3.8 Public expenditure for domestic
climate action
Iceland’s climate funding includes direct contributions to climate action, expenditure for 
changed travel habits, tax incentives and additional funding. 
In 2018, the Government issued a funded Climate Action Plan that marked a turning point 
in combatting climate change in Iceland. These fiscal measures set a new high for climate-
related spending and which was further increased along with the updated Climate Action 
Plan in 2020. Based on the Government’s fiscal plan for 2022-2026, direct contributions for 
climate action will be 2-2.6 billion ISK annually in the period 2022-2026. Moreover, climate 
funding will be increased annually by 1 billion ISK in the period 2022-2031, in order to 
finance Iceland’s enhanced goals on climate change mitigation. Expenditure for changed 
travel habits and tax incentives are additional to the aforementioned spending. 10

37On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
Specifically, additional spending is foreseen in the fields of nature-based solutions, 
agriculture, energy transition and sustainable transport. 
Funding has been significantly increased to improve scientific knowledge and minimise 
uncertainty and to strengthen Iceland’s national inventory and reporting system of 
emissions and carbon sequestration. 
3.8.1 Policies and measures for related research, development and 
innovation 
The Government aims to support strategic programming for climate-related research and 
innovation to underpin and catalyse climate action in Iceland. Specifically, support has 
been focused on basic research on climate-related processes to insure a strong scientific 
foundation for decision making on mitigation and adaptation measures. This research 
funding targets improvements of accounting of emissions and sequestration in the LULUCF 
sector, inter alia in alignment with Iceland’s Science and Technology Strategy.11 Funds are 
also allocated through strategic funding via the Climate Fund, Societal Challenges Fund 
Program with grants for projects on sustainable development and climate change, as well 
as the Energy Fund, which focuses on measures to cut emissions from fossil fuels.12 
Iceland has developed and funded an improvement plan on measures to be taken 
to improve Iceland’s greenhouse gas inventory. Improved scientific knowledge and 
accounting should provide more accurate estimates and improve the knowledge base for 
estimating the effect of different policies and measures.
The Climate Fund, established by law in 2012 and operationalised in 2019, primarily 
supports projects in the field of green technology innovation that aim at strengthening 
research and development related to the introduction of new climate-friendly technology 
solutions and design and public education related to the impact of climate change.13

38On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
The Ministry for The Environment and Natural Resources has supported specific topics 
in order to enhance research in particular gaps in local climate knowledge. For instance, 
by the establishment of a research fund to support scientific research on the interplay of 
land use and climate. Research in this area is a prerequisite for Iceland to achieve its goals 
in tackling climate change, and to make it possible to systematically protect and restore 
ecosystems.14
3.9 Contribution to a low-emission 
development pathway in other countries
A significant amount of Iceland’s ODA is focused on climate action with 20% of total 
support in 2019 directly aimed at mitigation measures and 34.1% at adaptation measures.  
As a part of its renewed NDCs, Iceland increased its year-on-year funding for climate 
related development programs and projects by 45% in 2021. Iceland plans to increase its 
overall climate funding by another 10% next year. 
Along with the other Nordics, Iceland is committed to building back better and greener 
and is aligning development policies and programmes with international climate and 
environment objectives, including supporting OECD DACs work on aligning to the Paris 
Agreement.
This is reflected in Iceland’s position and advocacy at the UN, the World Bank, and the 
OECD. At the World Bank, Iceland, together with the Nordic Baltic Constituency, has for 
example advocated strongly against financing coal and other fossil fuel projects. 
Climate action is an integrated part of Iceland bilateral development cooperation, 
which includes clean-cooking initiatives, locally harvested school meals and integrating 
renewable energy solutions in its bilateral development cooperation programmes in 
education, health and water and sanitation such as electrifying schools and health-care 
facilities in partner districts in Malawi and Uganda. 
Through long-established fellowship programs, project financing, and technical assistance 
Icelandic will continue sharing climate-related expertise in the field of geothermal and 
renewable energy, sustainable use of marine resources and waters, soil conservation, and 
measures to enhance the measures of societies to mitigate and adapt to climate change.15

4. Stakeholder-generated  
Scenarios for Climate Neutrality
In this section scenarios based on a stakeholder engagement study on pathways to
a climate neutral Iceland in 2040 are showcased. The specific delineations of the 
scenarios do not reflect government decisions but are modelled projections by a 
team of researchers based on views and opinions expressed by the participants in 
the stakeholder engagement. Still, the scenarios figure a field of potential pathways 
towards net zero emissions, bearing in mind that the path will likely be some kind of 
combination of many measures. 
In 2017, the Icelandic Government agreed on a climate neutral Iceland no later than 
2040 and implemented the goal into the Climate Act in 2021. Different options exist 
regarding what a climate neutral Icelandic society could look like, and so do the 
corollary trajectories towards that goal. To craft a robust long-term strategy towards 
net zero emissions, identifying and comparing different trajectories is necessary.
When identifying how a climate neutral Iceland could be structured and realised, 
widespread stakeholder engagement is important to ensure that diverse viewpoints 
are represented. 
The advantages of such engagement include:
•  The creation of a common vision of the future and what it entails
•  A common vision of different measures required and their implications
•  Understanding of diverse viewpoints
•  Empowerment of participants to contribute to a climate neutral future
•  Increased likelihood of support for necessary action

4.1 Scenarios from stakeholder engagement
In 2021, a study was carried out by the University of Iceland and the University of 
Reykjavik, on behalf of the Government of Iceland. The scope of the project was to 
initiate a dialogue on how to reach climate neutrality and what this would mean 
in Icelandic context. The study is a part of a longer participatory process towards 
the goal of net zero emissions no later than 2040. A special minister-appointed 
working group was established to advise on the work of the Universities on the 
project on climate neutrality, including specialists from numerous Ministries and 
key stakeholders. 
Firstly, a randomly selected group of people was invited to participate in a survey 
and a consequent workshop. Covid-19 put its mark on the process with meetings 
being held online. Participants discussed various topics and moderators elaborated 
discussions. Following this, the researchers were able to identify two major themes 
in the discussions: 1) a focus on technological versus natural solutions and 2) climate 
neutrality would be confined to a society similar to the one we know now, versus a 
society where systemic changes have occurred, such as a significant changes in meat 
consumption, travel habits and consumer habits.

42On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
Following the discussion and its analysis, a team of modulators at the University of 
Iceland and the University of Reykjavik analysed different scenarios based on the 
solutions provided by the public. 
4.1.1 Scenario A – Technological solutions
Scenario A is characterised by climate neutrality which has been reached through 
technological solutions without systems change.
The Icelandic society described in Scenario A is an open, industrial and high-
tech society that relies on energy-intensive industries, large-scale fishing and 
tourism. Sustainable use of renewable energy resources is the foundation for 
continued reliance on energy-intensive industries and electrification of transport. 
Both economic growth and population growth is high. This is rooted in high levels 
of consumerism, which translates into high levels of waste and high travel demand 
with a preference for private transport solutions. Agriculture takes place around the 
country, where farm size has increased. Diet preferences are for animal products.
Technological solutions have enabled reaching net zero emissions. The energy system 
largely runs on domestic renewable energy. Transport on land relies on electricity, 
hydrogen or synfuels, but aviation and marine transport have only partially switched 
to low-carbon solutions. However, the fishing industry has switched to hydrogen 
or synfuels. Emissions from energy-intensive industries are captured and either 
mineralised or used to produce synfuels. All organic waste is composted and/or 
gasified. Better manure management is practiced in agriculture where wet manure 
is used to produce methane. Less emphasis is given to carbon sequestration and 
wetland reclamation and is practiced only to complete the road to climate neutrality.
4.1.2 Scenario B – Nature-based solutions
Scenario B is characterised by climate neutrality which has been reached through 
nature-based solutions without systems change.
The Icelandic society described in Scenario B is an open, industrial society that relies 
on energy-intensive industries, large-scale fishing and tourism. Sustainable use of 
renewable energy resources is the foundation for continued reliance on energy-
intensive industries and electrification of light-duty transport. Both economic 
growth and population growth is high. This is rooted in high levels of consumerism, 
which translates into high levels of waste and high travel demand with a preference 
for private transport solutions. Agriculture takes place around the country, where 
farm size has increased. Diet preferences are for animal products. 
43On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
Nature-based solutions have secured climate neutrality, including a significant effort 
in carbon sequestration through revegetation and reforestation. Greenhouse gas 
emissions have also been mitigated by wetland reclamation. All organic waste is 
composted and/or gasified. Transport on land relies on electricity or biofuels, but 
aviation and marine transport have only partially switched to low-carbon solutions. 
Electricity and biofuels are used in fisheries, agriculture uses fertilisers more 
effectively and has changed composition of feed for livestock with increased use of 
seaweed as feed for cattle to reduce methane production from enteric fermentation.
4.1.3 Scenario C – Technological solutions and systems change 
Scenario C is characterised by climate neutrality which has been reached through 
technological solutions and systems change.
The Icelandic society described in scenario C is a sustainable, high-tech society 
that is diverse, circular and climate aware. Sustainable use of renewable energy 
resources supports green industrial development and electrification of transport. 
The economy relies on diverse green industries replacing 50% of aluminium smelters, 
including low-carbon industries such as data centres and high-tech horticulture. 
Fishing and tourism continue to be important parts of the economy. Both population 
growth and economic growth is moderately high. Scenario C is rooted in moderate 
levels of private consumption with increased emphasis on increased durability and 
greener solutions. This translates into moderate levels of waste, reduced travel 
demand with increased emphasis on public transport and active transport modes. 
Diet preferences have changed with increased demand for plant-based diets. 
Agriculture with focus on livestock takes place around the country, but demand 
and thus production levels are moderate of sheep- and cattle-based products. As a 
result, the numbers of sheep and cattle in the country have declined.
Both systems change, as described above, and technological solutions have enabled 
reaching net zero emissions. The energy system largely runs on domestic renewable 
energy. Transport on land relies on electricity, hydrogen or synfuels but aviation and 
marine transport have only partially switched to low-carbon solutions. The fishing 
industry has switched to low-carbon fuels such as electricity, hydrogen or synfuels, 
in addition to increased use of fishing gear that is lighter and thus less energy 
intensive. Emissions from remaining energy-intensive industries is captured and 
either mineralised or used to produce synfuels. Livestock has declined in agriculture, 
and manure management has improved. All organic waste is composted and/or 
gasified. Less emphasis is given to carbon sequestration and wetland reclamation 
and is practiced only to complete the road to climate neutrality.
44On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
4.1.4 Scenario D – Nature-based solutions and system change 
Scenario D is characterised by climate neutrality that has been reached through 
nature-based solutions and systems change.
The Icelandic society described in scenario D is a sustainable society that is 
diverse, circular and aware, with an increased sense of community focusing on local 
solutions. Sustainable use of renewable energy resources supports green industrial 
development, where aluminium smelters have been replaced, and electrification of 
transport. The economy relies on diverse smaller scale green industries, smaller 
scale fisheries, smaller farms and tourism. Both economic growth and population 
growth are comparatively low. This is rooted in, lower levels of private consumption 
with increased emphasis on increased durability and greener solutions derived or 
produced locally. Waste levels have drastically declined, including food waste.
Travel demand has declined with significantly increased emphasis on public 
transport and active transport modes. Diet preferences have significantly changed 
with increased demand for plant-based diets based on domestic/local production. 
Agriculture has been transformed with smaller farms and significantly reduced 
emphasis on raising livestock due to changes in diet preferences. As a result, the 
numbers of sheep and cattle in the country have significantly declined.
Nature-based solutions and systems change as described above have secured 
climate neutrality, including a significant effort in carbon sequestration through 
revegetation and reforestation. Greenhouse gas emissions have also been mitigated 
by wetland reclamation. Levels of waste have significantly declined, but all organic 
45On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
waste is composted and/or gasified. Transport demand has declined with a 
significant overall increase in public transport. Transport on land relies on electricity 
or biofuels, but aviation and marine transport have only partially switched to low-
carbon solutions. The fishing industry has switched to low-carbon biofuels and 
electricity, in addition to a significant increase in use of fishing gear that is lighter 
and thus less energy intensive. Stock size of sheep and cattle has significantly 
declined, fertilisers are used more effectively, and seaweed is used for feed for 
cattle to reduce methane production from enteric fermentation. 
4.1.5 Scenario E – Combines technological and nature-based 
solutions and system changes
Scenario E combines technological and nature-based solutions and systems changes 
from scenarios A, B and C in a relatively moderate way.
Scenario E is an open, industrial and high-tech society that relies on energy-
intensive industries, large-scale fishing and tourism. Carbon neutrality has been 
reached by a combination of technological and nature-based solutions, with some 
systems changes. Both population growth and economic growth is moderately high. 
Travel demand has increased, but with increased emphasis on public transport and 
active transport modes. Diet preferences have moved towards more plant-based 
diets.
Transport on land relies on electricity, hydrogen or synfuels, but aviation and marine 
transport have only partially switched to low-carbon solutions. However, the fishing 
industry has switched to hydrogen or synfuels. Emissions from energy-intensive 
industries are captured and either mineralised or used to produce synfuels. All 
organic waste is composted and/or gasified. Carbon sequestration and wetland 
reclamation are used alongside technological solutions to complete the road to 
carbon neutrality.
4.1.6 Scenario emission paths in different LULUCF contexts
All the scenarios aim for climate neutrality no later than 2040 and all the scenarios 
succeed in reaching net zero emissions no later than 2040. However, to reach net zero 
emissions, reforestation, revegetation, and wetland reclamation (called LULUCF-
based mitigation) are actively used at different levels for the different scenarios. The 
required use of land for LULUCF-based mitigation depends on the effectiveness of 
the other solutions and changes embedded in the scenarios. The less effective, the 
more land required. The amount of land required to reach climate neutrality in 2040 
46On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
thereby reflects indirectly the effectiveness of the other mitigation measures and 
systems changes at play in the different scenarios. 
Iceland’s path towards climate neutrality can differ quite significantly based on 
which measures will be taken. Figures 10-12 all show five different paths reflecting 
the stakeholder-generated policy extremes in the directions of technology, nature 
and systems change, in terms of their projected development of greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
Figure 10 shows the different paths without LULUCF emission or sequestration. 
Moreover, the figure shows that the goal of climate neutrality will not be reached 
without using removals of carbon from the atmosphere to compensate for emissions 
that are unlikely to be eliminated.

While Figure 10 does not capture emissions or sequestration from LULUCF, figures 11 
and 12 show how measures for revegetation and wetland restoration can influence 
net emissions. Both figures show different paths based on a significant additional 
increase in land use mitigation measures. Figure 11 shows the development of net 
emissions in each of the stakeholder-generated scenarios to 2040 including LULUCF 
sequestration.

Only including LULUCF sequestration in the projection, that is, without LULUCF 
emissions, leads to significant net negative emissions in 2040 in all stakeholder-
generated scenarios. However, in Figure 12 where LULUCF emissions are also depicted, 
all scenarios hit or come very close to net zero emissions around 2040, except scenario 
B (nature-based solutions without systems change) which is still projected far away.

The difference between figures 11 and 12, reflecting calculations including LULUCF 
sequestration without and with LULUCF emissions, underscores the large proportion 
of greenhouse gas emissions from land, a unique feature of Iceland’s emissions profile. 
The high proportion of LULUCF emissions in total emission and great uncertainty 
of their estimate must be considered when defining the path towards climate 
neutral Iceland 2040. To address this uncertainty, Iceland is working on extensive 
improvements to improve accounting of emissions and carbon sequestration in the 
LULUCF sector.

50On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
5. Path to Climate Neutrality
The Icelandic Government is committed to the task of creating a climate neutral 
society with net zero emissions and to fulfil Iceland’s international obligations. 
Iceland has submitted an updated nationally determined contribution under the 
Paris Agreement, enhancing its commitment to at least 55% net greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction by 2030 compared to 1990, to be achieved by acting jointly with 
the EU and its Member States and Norway.
Reaching the goal of net zero emissions is not a straightforward task and new 
strategies and measures need to be put in place to reach the target. The transition 
to a climate neutral society requires strong commitment, investment on all fronts 
and planning. It is important to continue the collection of data and best practices 
to continue the political debate on the way forward. A carbon neutral society will 
require reducing all emissions, keeping in mind their different sources and the 
variety of solutions applicable to each sector. Therefore it is likely that the way 
forward will be a combined set of different sectoral strategies and measures. The 
strategy needs to be flexible and to allow for new innovative solutions that might be 
found on the path to climate neutrality. 
Going forward, the creation and systematic reconsideration of a credible strategy 
for a climate neutral Iceland no later than 2040 relies on the engagement of different 
groups of stakeholders and cooperation across governmental actors, industry 
partners, non-governmental organisations and municipalities. This includes public 
participation in building the strategy to ensure a just transition to a circular, 
competitive, climate neutral future.
The regularly updated Climate Action Plan will continue to be Iceland’s primary 
policy mechanism to coordinate the implementation of the mitigation measures 
which are at the heart of a goal for climate neutral Iceland no later than 2040. To 
support reaching the goal, further data and analysis is needed. 
The uncertainty regarding LULUCF emissions is an ongoing challenge for discussions 
and decision-making on net zero emissions policy in Iceland. Furthermore, the 
depiction of scenarios in section 4 in different LULUCF contexts, shows the unique 
significance of how LULUCF targets are defined and framed for the country. Part of 
51On the Path to Climate Neutrality  October 2021
the enhanced support for basic and applied research on climate change in Iceland 
is specifically directed at studies regarding the interplay of land use and climate.
The next step is to further the discussion on how to reach climate neutrality, e.g. 
using the results from the stakeholder study. A just path to climate neutrality should 
involve all sectors, different stakeholders and the general public in the discussion 
and the decision making. 
Iceland intends to update its communication of a long-term strategy when further 
analysis and policy documents are published on the matter.
