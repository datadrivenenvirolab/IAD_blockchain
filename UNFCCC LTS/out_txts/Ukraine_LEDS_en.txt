44SUMMARY 
Low emission development strategy (hereafter – LEDS) determines national stakeholders 
agreed vision on decoupling further economic and social growth of the State and its social 
development from the growth in greenhouse gases emissions (hereafter – GHG).
LEDS development has become Ukraine's ﬁrst experience in synergy approach application, as 
climate change problem solution requires signiﬁcant advances in the key sectors of economy 
and main components to human livelihood.  
On the one hand, LEDS is based upon the national priorities for sustainable development and 
current sectoral strategies, while, on the other, it determines a potential pathway for 
economic development with due account of the goals for the state policy on emission 
reduction and GHG absorption. 
At the national level, the LEDS is an instrument for public administration and shaping of 
climate responsible behavior of both businesses and citizens, while at the international level, 
it supports a global target on stabilization of GHG concentration in accordance to the 
scenario of global average temperature increase conﬁnement to well below 2°С of pre-
industrial level. 
Existence of LEDS is the basis   for development and implementation of economic 
instruments used to support Ukraine's transition to low emission development, attraction of 
innovation technologies and international ﬁnancial resources.
LEDS is made of six sections.
64FIRST SECTION «Strategic vision of low emission future for Ukraine» brieﬂy describes 
the problems in Ukraine's economic development and approaches to solve them, as 
well as the LEDS's goal and objectives.
The LEDS goal is to determine strategic directions for Ukraine's economy sustainable develop-
ment based on national priorities accordant transition to low emission growth trajectory. 
Strategy objectives: 
Objective I. Transition to energy system which envisions the use of energy sources with low 
carbon content, development of the sources of clean electricity and heat energy, increase in 
energy efﬁciency and energy saving in all sectors of economy and housing and utilities 
infrastructure facilities, stimulation of the use of alternative to oil motor fuels and transition of 
cargo and passenger carrying operations to more environmentally clean types of transport. 
Objective IІ. Increase in the volumes of carbon absorption and uptake with the help of best 
climate change mitigation practices in agriculture and forestry. 
Objective IІІ.  Reduction in GHG emissions such as methane gas and nitrogen oxide predomi-
nantly associated with fossil fuel production, agriculture and waste.
LEDS focuses on policies and measures which will be gradually implemented up to the mid of 
the current century СНВР, and envisions their periodical review and adjustment. 
SECOND SECTION «Prerequisites to low carbon development» includes information on:
Conclusions of IPCC - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (hereafter IPCC), which 
justify the need in GHG reduction in order to maintain such status of climate system which 
will preclude growing in the risks for health and wellbeing of people and environment.
Main goals of Paris Agreement, which aims to strengthen the global response to the 
threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate 
poverty, and the expected outcomes for Ukraine from this Agreement implementation.
Dynamics in Ukraine's GHG emission for the period 1990 – 2015, including explanations of 
the speciﬁc features in their observed trajectory, as well as the main factors underpinning 
them. In particular, the GHG emissions in 2015 amounted to 323.36 million tons of CO -
2
equivalent, with the exception of sector «land use, changes in land use and forestry » 
(hereafter - LULUCF), which is by 66.4% lower than in the base 1990 year. If the LULUCF is 
included, the emissions in 2015 amounted to 308.64 million tons of CO2-equivalent, which is 
by 66.1% less compared to base year. 
Dynamics in Ukraine's average annual temperature deviations from climate normal over 
the period from 1961 – 2015, list of climate change impacts and substantial consequences. 
7Ukraine's international cooperation and participation in climate change mitigation effort.
THIRD SECTION «Legislative and institutional foundations, » describes legislative 
framework supporting low emission development, speciﬁcally:
Fundamental legislative acts on sustainable development, Ukraine EU Association, 
ratiﬁcation of Paris Agreement, Concept for the State Environmental Policy Implementation.
Acts issued by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine pertaining to the State policy on 
climate change.
Energy Laws and Acts of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.
Renewable energy and Energy Saving Laws and Acts of the Cabinet of Ministers of 
Ukraine. 
Laws and Acts of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, draft strategies for development of 
different climate related industries in Ukraine's economy.   
Central Executive Body authorized to form and implement the State policy on climate Change is 
the Ministry for Ecology and Natural Resources of Ukraine. Inter-agency Commission on 
implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (hereafter 
UNFCCC) is an advisory body for coordination of activities on different climate change related 
aspects.  
FOURTH SECTION «Decarbonization of Energy in Ukraine» makes the key section of LEDS 
as the energy sector's share in total emissions of GHG amounts to 65%, and if taken 
together with GHG generated by the “Industrial processes sector,” the share totals at 82%. 
According to 2015 data, carbon intensity of Ukraine's GDP is 1.9 times higher than the global 
ﬁgure,   2.4 times higher than that of the OECD countries and 3.3 higher than that of 28 EU 
member states. Over 1990-2015 the GDP's carbon intensity was going down, yet, under the 
current economic policy the pace of such reduction is not sufﬁcient.
According to Baseline (business as usual) scenario, which envisions that the characteristics for 
most of technologies that households apply in their use and consumption of energy resources  
and  those  applied  throughout  all  the  stages  of  goods  and  services  production  remain 
unchanged up to 2050,  projections of GHG emissions  in «Energy» and «Industrial processes»  
are the following:

The highest reduction in GHG emissions level will be attained by 2035, after that, the GHG 
emissions may show insigniﬁcant growth. Under this scenario, the share of GHG emissions shall 
amount to 34% of 1990 level, which is by one percentage point higher compared to the above 
presented scenario. Under the «Energy efﬁciency, renewable energy scenario» which does not 
include modernization and innovations,  higher share of renewable energy sources was needed 
in the structure  of energy resources production and consumption in the sphere of traditional 
generation, in particular. 
Group of policies and measures in the sphere of modernization and innovation includes 
the following:
1 Increase in power plant operations;
2 Nuclear energy development;

Modelling results show that in 2050 the GHG emissions in «Energy» and «Industrial processes» 
sectors (according to IPCC classiﬁcation) may be reduced to the level of 31-34% of 1990, or to 
260-285 million t of СО2-equivalent, given that a wide set of low carbon policies and measures 
for low emission development of Ukraine are implemented,, which, in its turn, will lead to posi-
tive social and economic outcomes,  in particular, additional growth in GDP and real households 
income. 
FIFTH SECTION «Reduction of GHG other than CO2» describes policies and measures in 
three areas of activities, aimed at reduction of methane and nitrogen emissions, speciﬁ-
cally:

storage of fossil fuels includes the following policies and measures: 
1 Reduction  of leaks in gas sector;
2 Reduction in leaks  in the process of oil extraction, transportation and processing;
3 Removal, use and recycling of coalmine methane from underground coalmines.
141II. Improvement of waste treatment includes the following policies and measures:
1 Reduction in the amounts of waste and prevention of waste generation;
2 Conducting social advertising campaign aimed at reduction of domestic waste 
generation; 
3 Improvement of methods applied to waste treatment, promotion the repeated use 
and secondary recycling of waste; 
4 Improvement of wastewater treatment.
III. Activities in agriculture include the following policies and measures:
1 Improvement of the treatment process of animal origin byproducts;
2 Optimization of agricultural crops fertilization systems.

Optimization of land use structure, extension of space covered with forests, wood 
1
lines and  green planting under enhanced interagency coordination;
2 Betterment of business practices in the sector using the climate smart  methods  in 
agriculture and forestry;
3 Development and implementation of national program for forestry development 
using the  best international experience in this ﬁeld;

12Due to speciﬁc features in the age structure of Ukraine's forests, it is expected that moving 
forward their absorption capacity will gradually decrease because of a declining growth in 
phytomass attributable to forest stands' natural aging processes. 
Yet, if Ukraine's forest cover increase up to 19.4 % and progressive management solutions are 
implemented, in 2050 the volumes of GHG absorption by the forests will amount to 85% of 
1990 level. Given appropriate implementation of other policies and measures in the LULUCF 
sector, the GHG emissions and absorption balance will reach 1990 level.   
Being committed to achieving Paris Agreement goals and being guided by 
national priorities, Ukraine will ensure doing its best to achieve the indicative 
GHG emissions target of 31-34% by 2050, compare to 1990 level. This target is 
ambitious and fair in the context of Ukraine’s participation in the global 
i response to the climate change threat. 
Long term strategic planning is an iterative process; hence, this document 
should not be treated as ﬁnal. Ukraine is planning to review its strategy at 
least every ﬁve years in order to measure its progress, and to increase the level 
of its ambitions in accordance to national circumstances.

114451.1.  Problems and challenges of Ukraine's sustainable development 
Transition of Ukraine's economy to low carbon trajectory is an important component to 
Government policy aimed to ensure its sustainable development, speciﬁcally, in the context of 
2030 Global sustainable development goals.
Following the signing of the Association Agreement between Ukraine as one Party, and 
European Union, European  Atomic Energy Community, and their member states, as the other 
Party  (hereafter  - EU Association Agreement) enhancement of competitiveness has been the 
main challenge for Ukraine's economic development. Main directions to resolve this problem 
include establishment of more favorable investment climate, stimulation of innovations, mod-
ernization of ﬁxed production assets, and creation of high technology jobs, raising the labor and 
production efﬁciency, and implementation of structural and institutional reforms. 
Innovation-investment development model should become the foundation for extended social 
restoration, where the increase in the volumes of output produced and increase in its competi-
tiveness are achieved not by means of additional use of resources, but mainly through intensive 
production factors, active use of new knowledge and materialized outcome of such knowledge. 
Added to this is the fact that negative trends that are observed in production sphere and include 
aging of ﬁxed assets, technological equipment, and loss of the most skilled staff etc, make it 
more difﬁcult for Ukraine's economy to get out of systemic crises. Therefore, resolute transition 
to innovation development model is the only solution to the crisis.
Ukraine needs high pace of GDP growth to overcome poverty and impoverishment of citizens, 
yet, it should be underscored, that  a new development model should be  – «green» restoration, 
«green» growth, «green» development,   which is based on the inﬂow of investments into 
renewable sources of energy, environmentally safe production, and «green»  technologies.
1.2.  Goals and objectives of Ukraine's low emission development strategy.
The LEDS goal is to determine strategic directions for Ukraine's economy sustainable develop-
ment based on the national priorities accordant transition to low emission growth trajectory. 
Strategic vision of low carbon future is reﬂected in the LEDS objectives:
Objective I. Transition to energy system which envisions the use of energy sources with low 
carbon content, development of the sources of clean electricity and heat energy, increase in 
energy efﬁciency and energy saving in all sectors of economy and at housing and utilities 
infrastructure facilities, stimulation the use of alternative to oil motor fuels and transition of 
cargo and passenger carrying operations to more environmentally clean types of transport. 
De-carbonization of energy system shall bring about structural changes in the economy, 
primarily through reduced demand for fossil fuels, which will bolster investment opportunities 
for machine and equipment building, and facilitate expansion of markets for new technology 
and incentives to further innovations. 
15Objective IІ. Increase in the volumes of carbon absorption and uptake with the help of best 
climate change mitigation practices in agriculture and forestry. 
Policy of climate change prevention and mitigation in the sectors of land use and forestry   
requires strengthening of institutional and improvement of regulatory framework, speciﬁcally, 
with respect to retention and enhancement of climate protection function of forests and soils. 
Application of climate smart methods in agriculture and forestry will result in the increased 
volumes of carbon absorption and uptake.
Objective IІІ.  Reduction in GHG emissions such as methane gas and nitrogen oxide predomi-
nantly associated with fossil fuel production, agriculture and waste. 
 
In addition to reduction in GHG emissions, development and implementation of innovation 
technologies and production management methods in the above mentioned spheres, will 
contribute to improvement in human health and reduce the level of environmental degradation.
  
In the process of Ukraine 2050 LEDS development the best global practices were 
taken into account,   and the policies and measures were widely discussed by 
! sectoral work groups, which included decision makers, representatives of aca-
demic and expert communities and public. 
 
LEDS is focused on the policies and measures which will be gradually imple-
mented up to the mid of the current century, and envisions their periodic review 
and adjustment.

OF TRANSITION 
TOWARDS LOW CARBON 
DEVELOPMENT

182.1. Climate change combatting advantages  
According to IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, research on detection and establishment of the 
causes behind climate change have demonstrated that anthropogenic  inﬂuence on global 
climate system  is the main reason of its undeniable warming, which  has been observed since 
1950. Human inﬂuence has also resulted in substantial increase of regional temperatures at the 
continent and subcontinent levels. It is expected that the change in temperature distribution 
towards warmer regimes will also result in higher repeatability and intensity of extremely high 
temperature periods.
It is highly likely that from 2000 to 2100 increase in average global temperature of the air will 
amount from two до 5 °C, and raising of sea level - from 0.6 to 1.2 meters with a possibility for 
signiﬁcantly higher growth. Climate change can make long-term economic growth impossible 
and will increase the risks for human livelihood security at global level. As its consequences, the 
climate change will include more frequent waves of heat, drought and other extreme weather 
phenomena, change in precipitation regime and exhaustion of ecosystems, which will substan-
tially increase the risks to health and wellbeing of people and environment.  
Paris Agreement, in enhancing the implementation of the UNFCCC, aims to strengthen the 
global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development 
and efforts to eradicate poverty, including by:
«Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-
industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels, recognizing that this would signiﬁcantly reduce the risks and impacts of 
climate change; 
Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate 
resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development, in a manner that does not 
threaten food production; and;
Making ﬁnance ﬂows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions 
and climate-resilient development».
In Ukraine, achievement of optimum interrelationship (synergy) of Paris Agreement goals 
with Ukraine's national priorities will make it possible to:
Enhance the role of energy efﬁciency and general technological modernization  of 
economy on the  basis  sustainable development;
Implement the renewable energy sources on broader and more sound basis;
Ensure interlink ages of the State policy in the climate change sphere with the strategies, 
policies,  plans and programs in other spheres of  economic and social development of 
the State;
Implement new economic instruments to ensure optimum way for  Ukraine to make its  
national determined contribution into Paris Agreement;
Establish grounds to attract climate investments into Ukraine's economy;
Strengthen Ukraine's role in international climate change combatting efforts.
182.2.  Greenhouse gas emissions  
In Ukraine GHG emission in 2015 amounted to 323.36 million tons of CO2-equivalent, the excep-
tion is the sector of LULUCF, with its emissions by 66.4% lower than in the base 1990 year, and by 
12.3% less than in 2014. Inclusive of LULUCF sector, emissions in 2015 totaled at 308.64 million 
tons of CO2-equivalent, which is by 66.1% less compared to base year, and by 13.2% less com-
pared to 2014.   
Such a reduction is mainly attributed to decrease in the use of energy resources due to decline
in GDP, decrease in Ukraine's population number and lowering of social standards of life
(ﬁgure 2.1).

Figure 2.1. Ukraine's economic, energy and climate performance over 1990-2015. 
19General trend of GHG emissions may be broken down into the following periods:
1 Sharp drop in GHG emissions over 1990-1999, which is attributed to collapse of the 
Soviet Union and adjustment of Ukraine's economy to new environment. In addition to that, a 
signiﬁcant decline in GDP was also taking place; 
2 Stabilization and restoration of economic growth over 1999-2008. This period is char-
acterized by a relatively stable economic development and GDP growth. The trend of GHG 
emissions dynamics does not capture GDP growth, because taking place over this period are 
structural shifts in economy which increased  the role of trade, services and ﬁnances in compari-
son to  industrial output growth rate;
3 Decline and gradual restoration of GHG emissions over the 2008-2012. This period 
reﬂects severe effect of global ﬁnancial and economic crises.  Particularly affected were export  
oriented industries such as  – iron and steel industry,  chemical industry, machine building, and 
also industries related to them – such as electric grid industry  and mining industry;
2013-2015  –  Ukrainian production sector, which generates 21-23% of GDP, demon-
strated  negative  dynamics.  Almost  all  industries  reduced  their  volumes  of  output. 
Pharmaceutical was the only industry which demonstrated positive growth dynamics in its 
output; 
5 Starting with 2016, owing to a number of structural reforms, Ukrainian economy has 
started its gradual growth.  
Given below are the factors producing adverse effects on the structure and dynamics in    
Ukraine's economy development:
Temporary annexation of the AR of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol' by the Russian 
Federation ;
Military actions of Russian Federation in some areas of Donets'k and Luhans'k oblasts, which 
result in reduction of output in the region, worsening of conditions for attraction of external 
ﬁnancing and increase in the State Budget expenditures to fund the needs of defense sector and 
national security and  rehabilitation of the ruined infrastructure.
According to ﬁndings of experts from the National Institute of Strategic Studies,  secondary 
effects from internal political and economic shakeups, annexation of Crimea, the city of 
Sevastopol' and some areas in Donets'k and Luhans'k  regions permeated most sectors of 
Ukraine's economy. In consequence, to that, current GDP misbalances are growing, volumes of 
industrial output, construction works, foreign trade and the amount of attracted and disbursed 
capital investments are decreasing. 
20СО2  is the heaviest GHG, its share over 1990-2015 amounted to 65-75%. The share of methane 
stays in the range of 21-33%, and that of N2O – 6-8% (ﬁgure 2.2 and ﬁgure 2.3).

Norm (1961-1990 )  +7.8°C Average 1991-2016  +8.8 °C Average 2007-2016 +9.4 °C
Warming brings about:
Sudden changes in weather;
Increased frequency and intensity  of dangerous and natural hydro meteorological events   
during the warm  season of the year (showers, thunders, rain squall, hail,  long periods of heat - 
heat waves), and in cold season (heavy snowfalls, glazed frost,  complex slush buildup);
Increased frequency and intensity  of  droughts, and territories covered by them;
22Reduction in river ﬂows in the South and South East of Ukraine, increase in the intensity of 
river ﬂoods in the Western part of Ukraine (Subcarpathia and Transcarpathia), in particular, the 
Dniester basin, change in the intra-river structure of river ﬂows in Ukraine;
Raise in the level of Black and Azov seas, which strengthens the processes of erosion, and 
stream bank erosion, which results in ﬂooding, saturation and soil salting in the coastal area.
Substantial consequences of climate change include increased risks in relation to:
Human health, stemming from practically all manifestations of climate change;
Signiﬁcant reduction in yields of major agricultural crops  in consequence  of dry weather 
phenomena and emergence of unseen earlier pests and pathogenic diseases of agricultural 
crops,  and also due to other extreme weather phenomena;
Exacerbation of problems with water supply in southern and south east regions which suffer 
from drought  in summer, and where the residents are least provided with drinking water of 
appropriate quality;
Intensiﬁed  degradation of lands and desertiﬁcation due to high paced climate change;
Decrease in productivity, viability and  resilience of forests under signiﬁcant water stress, 
which  increases the likelihood  of ﬁres and outburst of mass  epidemics of pests; Accelerated 
degradation of ecosystems;
Accidents and unstable operation of electricity grids and district heating systems, other 
infrastructure facilities.
In the long-term perspective, adaptation to climate change in Ukraine shall be treated with the 
same degree of priority as climate change prevention, and will include such aspects of policy 
planning and improvement as expansion of knowledge base, scientiﬁcally justiﬁed identiﬁcation 
of needs and expenses, implementation of innovation approaches and establishment of condi-
tions favorable for attraction of external investments. 
2.4.  International cooperation  
Combatting the climate change is a global challenge, which requires broad international coop-
eration, global consensus to which was reﬂected in the whole number of successively concluded 
international Agreements including UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, and Paris Agreement. Since the 
tools envisioned in the ﬁrst two Agreements have not helped to achieve substantial reduction in 
GHG emissions, 195 countries, including the most powerful economies, have concluded Paris 
Agreement, which came into effect on November 4, 2016.
23According to the objective of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well 
below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, the Parties to Paris Agreement  must balance the sources 
of GHG emission and absorption in the second half of the current century, or to reach actually net 
zero global GHG emissions by 2100.
LEDS objectives for Ukraine comply with global objectives of Paris Agreement and joint interna-
tional actions will have critical importance to their achievement. In parallel to reducing the risks 
and climate change consequences international cooperation will contribute to signiﬁcant 
decrease in de-carbonization expenses, and will provide economic opportunities for both 
individuals and enterprises.
Brief description of Ukraine's participation history in the climate combatting processes is 
the following:
Party to Annex I to UNFCCC  since 1997;
Party to Annex В  to Kyoto Protocol since 2004;
First country in the world in joint projects implementation (250 projects),  47 million assigned 
amount units were issued under the green investment scheme  over 2008-2012 in the frame-
work of   Kyoto Protocol;  
Active participant to negotiation process  taking place in the framework of UNFCCC;
Climate related obligations were determined in accordance to EU-Ukraine Association 
Agreement  (2014);
Party to Paris Agreement (2016).
24LEGISLATIVE
AND INSTITUTIONAL 
FRAMEWORK  
3
27«Sustainable development strategy «Ukraine – 2020» is the main political document declaring 
comprehensive strategic guidelines of Ukraine's prospective development. The Document was 
approved by Presidential Decree dated 12 January 2015 № 5/2015. This Strategy envisions 
reforms in energy sector, agriculture, housing and utilities sector, land reform and implementa-
tion of programs for energy independence, increase in energy efﬁciency, and environmental 
protection.  
Association Agreement with EU, which became the part of National Legislation on September 
16, 2014 after its ratiﬁcation by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, envisioned gradual approxima-
tion of Ukraine's legislation to EU Laws and policies in energy efﬁciency, renewable energy, 
energy products taxation, waste treatment, and climate change, including  implementation of 
GHG allowances   trading scheme  in accordance to Directive 2003/87/EU  on establishment of 
greenhouse gas emission allowances trading scheme (ETS)  within the Community.
The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine ratiﬁed Paris Agreement on July 14, 2016 (Law of Ukraine № 
1469-VIII). Even before this the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine by its Instruction dated 16 
September 2015 № 980 approved the expected nationally determined contribution to this 
Agreement. It was declared that in 2030 the GHG emissions might not exceed 60% of 1990 
emissions level. Further review of ambitiousness level of this contribution is envisioned to factor 
in Ukraine's social and economic development indicators. In addition to that, to improve the 
current climate policy the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine in its instruction dated 7 December 
2016 № 932-р approved the Concept for Implementation of the State policy on Climate change 
up to 2030. The Concept determines the tasks in the following areas:
strengthening the institutional capacity for development and implementation of state policy 
on climate change;
prevention of climate change through reduction of anthropogenic emissions and increased 
greenhouse gas absorption to ensure gradual transition to low-carbon development of the 
country;
Adapting to climate change, increasing the resilience and reducing the climate change 
related risks.
Action plan was developed to implement the Concept for implementation of the State policy on 
climate change up to 2030.
Tax on carbon dioxide from ﬁxed sources, which was introduced in 2011, is the current ﬁscal 
instrument to reduce GHG emissions (Article 243 Section VIІІ of the Tax Code of Ukraine). 
Concept for implementation of the State policy on climate change up to 2030 envisions review-
ing its rate and administration procedure.
Ukraine's 2035 Energy Strategy: «Security, Energy efﬁciency, Competitiveness» approved by the 
Cabinet of Ministers Instruction dated 18 August 2017 № 605-r constitutes a fundamental 
26element of gradual transition to low carbon development policy. Because of completing the 
tasks envisioned by Ukraine's 2015 Energy strategy, it is planned to:
achieve more than twofold reduction in GDP energy intensity ;
Increase the use of renewable energy sources up to 25% of the total scope of primary energy 
supply.
Components  to current climate change prevention policy include the following effective 
national plans:
National Renewable Energy Action plan through 2020, approved by the Cabinet of Ministers 
Instruction dated 1 October 2014  № 902-р, envisions that  by 2020 the share of energy  pro-
duced from renewables shall amount to 11% of energy consumption mix; 
National  2020  energy  efﬁciency  action  plan,    approved  by  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers 
Instruction of 25 November 2015  № 1228, which envisions to reach in 2020 the indicative 
energy saving target of  9% of the average ﬁnal domestic energy consumption.
Action plan to implement the EU Parliament and Council Directive 2009/28/EC of the European 
Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from 
renewable sources, approved by the Cabinet of Ministers instruction of 3 September, 2014 № 
791-r, is geared to harmonization of Ukrainian and European legislation on the renewable 
energy sources (hereafter - RES). It is envisioned that sustainability criteria shall be developed for 
liquid and gaseous fuel, which is produced from biomass and used by transport vehicles, and for 
liquid fuel, which is produced from biomass and designated for energy use other than transport 
vehicles. Technical speciﬁcations to production and use of bio fuels and bio liquids are planned 
to be developed.  
According to the Law of Ukraine «On Amending Some Laws of Ukraine on "Green Tariff” 
Establishment» (of 25 September 2008 № 601), effective in Ukraine is the «green" tariff which is 
applicable to purchase electricity produced by the facilities using alternative energy sources 
(except blast furnace gas and coke gas, and in case of hydroenergy - only electricity which was 
generated by small hydropower plants).
To legally regulate the energy service related services the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine passed the 
Law of Ukraine  «On Introduction of New Investment Opportunities, Guarantee to the Rights and 
Lawful  Interests  of  Business  Entities  to  Ensure    Performance  of    a  Full  Scale  Energy 
Modernization » (of 9 April 2015  № 327-VIII, including amendments made in accordance to the 
Laws № 922-VIII of  25.12.2015; № 1980-VIII of 23.03.2017). In addition to that, respective 
changes were made into the Budget Code of Ukraine with regard to introduction of new invest-
ment opportunities, guarantee to the rights and lawful interests of business entities to ensure 
performance of a full-scale energy modernization, speciﬁcally, in the part that relates to deﬁni-
tion of energy service contract as a long-term credit liability.
27State construction codes  SCN  В.2.6-31:2016 «Heat insulation of buildings» were approved  to 
ensure rational use of energy resources for the purposes of heating and cooling, and to meet the 
required sanitary parameters of indoor climate as well as to ensure  long life of  envelope struc-
tures in the course of their use.  The said codes include requirements to energy efﬁciency and 
thermo technical characteristics of thermal insulation envelope for buildings and structures and 
their calculation procedure. SCN В.2.6-31:2016 are designated to be applied in doing design for 
the buildings and structures with heat, conditioning and cooling, in doing Greenﬁeld projects, 
modernization, thermal insulation and capital repairs.  
On June 22, 2017 the Verkhovna Rada passed the Law of Ukraine № 2118-VIII «On Energy 
Efﬁciency in the Buildings» which aims to establish conditions enabling reduced energy con-
sumption in the buildings in accordance to Directive 2010/331/EU of the European Parliament 
and of the Council “On the energy performance of building” as a part to implementation of 
ratiﬁed Treaty Establishing the Energy Community.  The Law regulates establishment of mini-
mum requirements to energy efﬁciency in the buildings, envisions introduction of certiﬁcation of 
energy efﬁciency and survey of engineering systems in the buildings. The Law also intends to 
regulate professional activity in the sphere of energy efﬁciency in the buildings.
The Law of Ukraine passed on 8 June 2017 envisioned establishment of Energy efﬁciency Fund, 
which is an important instrument to support energy efﬁciency initiatives. The said Fund complies 
with requirements of Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council as a 
part to implementation of ratiﬁed Treaty Establishing the Energy Community, and іs designated 
to stimulate and support measures aimed at increasing energy efﬁciency and energy saving 
mainly in residential sector buildings with due incorporation of respective national plans and for 
reduction in GHG emissions. 
Already passed or modiﬁed Laws of Ukraine support measures, instituting low emissions 
development in different spheres, speciﬁcally:
Law of Ukraine «On Natural Gas Market» (of  9 April 2015 № 329-VIII, with amendments 
introduced in accordance to the Law № 1541-VIII of 22.09.2016), which deﬁnes environmental 
protection, including energy efﬁciency, increased share of energy from alternative sources and 
reduction in GHG emissions as general public interest in the process of natural gas market 
operations.
Law of Ukraine  «On Electricity Market» (of 13 April 2017 № 2019-VIII), which envisions 
assignment by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of special obligations on market participants 
with regard to environmental protection, energy efﬁciency, increase in the share of energy 
produced from alternative energy sources and reduction in GHG emissions.
Law of Ukraine «On Alternative Energy Sources» (of 20 February 2003 № 555-IV, in the ver-
sion of 11.06.2017), which determines legal, economic, environmental and organizational basis 
for the use of alternative energy sources and fosters their more extensive use in the fuel and 
energy sector.
28Law of Ukraine  «On Alternative Types of Fuel» (of 14 January 2000  № 1391-XIV, in the ver-
sion of 24.11.2016), which envisions incentives to increase the share of alternative types  fuels  
use up to 20%  of the total scope  of fuel consumption by  2020.  
Law of Ukraine  «On  coalﬁeld gas (methane)» (of 21 May 2009 № 1392-VI, in the version of  
22.09.2016), which determines legal, economic, environmental and organizational  principles for 
activities in the sphere of geological study of coal ﬁeld  gas (methane), its extraction and removal 
in the course of degassing and further use as material and/or energy resource.
Since the time of Paris Agreement ratiﬁcation legal framework for the related industries polices is 
gradually changing, as climate change prevention and adaptation hereto have bearings on 
practically all sectors of economy and human livelihood. A number of below listed Laws and 
other regulations, already passed or drafted, envision to incorporate certain climate change 
related policy provisions into sectoral strategies:
Law of Ukraine «On Amending the Law of Ukraine «On Drinking Water and Drinking Water 
Supply» (of 18 May 2017 № 2047-VIII), which provisions aim to improve legal regulation of 
relations  associated with waste  water collection and to increase efﬁciency in the management 
of  drinking water suppliers  and water drainage  entities.   
Draft of the National 2030 Strategy on Waste Management in Ukraine, which was developed 
with due regard to the Framework Directive № 2008/98/EU on wastes, Directive  № 1999/31/EU 
on waste burial, Directive  № 2006/21/EU on management of extractive industries. The goal of 
this strategy is to create efﬁcient waste management system based on innovation principles, 
which in the end should facilitate waste recycling of natural resources and recycling of wastes. 
Draft of Ukraine's National 2030 transport strategy, which aims to comprehensively incorpo-
rate global priorities in transport policy, speciﬁcally, it envisions to reduce GHG from mobile 
sources by 60% compared to 1990, increase in the share of electric transport and electro cars 
vehicles usage, and to increase alternative fuels use share.
Draft Law of Ukraine «On Amending the Law of Ukraine «On the Main Foundations (strategy) 
of the State Environmental Policy of Ukraine through 2020», which extends the strategy up to 
2030,and envisions, among other things,  to broaden the Government tasks with respect to 
prevention of  increase in agricultural lands and territorial expansion of buildup territories and 
infrastructure;  increase in the forest covered space in Ukraine; establishment of conditions 
facilitating broad implementation of environmentally friendly and organic farming technolo-
gies.
Draft Strategy 2022 for sustainable development and institutional reformation of Ukraine's 
forestry and hunting sector, which envisions, among other things, integration and intensiﬁcation 
of forestry and hunting sector contribution to climate change prevention and facilitation of 
environmental sustainability of Ukraine. 
30Concept for the State heat supply policy implementation, which was approved by the Cabinet 
of Ministers Resolution of 18  August  2017  № 569-р, and aims to develop and determine the 
methods facilitating effective implementation of the state policy focused to ensure reliable 
provision of heat supply services, Ukraine's energy independence and security; reduce adverse 
effects on environment,  improve ﬁnancial and economic situation of enterprises, to introduce 
transparent efﬁcient system of payments between consumer and service suppliers, and to 
establish conditions and incentives geared to attract investment in heat supply sector.
Ministry for Ecology and Natural Resources of Ukraine is the Central executive body authorized 
to form and implement the State climate change policy.
Operating as Advisory Coordination body is the Interagency Commission on UNFCCC imple-
mentation (IAC), which was created by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine in 1999. IAC member-
ship includes ofﬁcials at the level of Deputy Ministers of key ministries and other executive 
bodies, plus, subject to, Ukrainian parliament members, representatives of R&D institutions and 
NGOs.
In addition, Ukraine has established a practice for broad engagement of representatives from 
academic and expert community, public and business community into the Task forces drafting 
legislation as well as other strategic climate change related documents.

Figure 4.3. Ukraine's GDP carbon and energy intensity over 1990-2015. 
De-carbonization process of Ukraine's energy sector is taking place, yet, under current economic 
and environmental policy, its pace is not sufﬁcient. For example, according to model generated  
estimates, in the absence of effective policy and de-carbonization measures in Ukraine's energy 
sector,  the GHG emissions will continue to  show constant growth and in  2050 may reach  70% 
of 1990 level, whereas in 2012 and 2015   they amounted to 44% and   31%, respectively. 
Underpinning such estimates  is also the fact that over 1990-2015  the dynamics of total GHG 
emissions was be corresponding to the  dynamics of GHG emissions in such sectors as «Energy» 
and  «Industrial processes» according to  IPCC  terminology (Figure 2.1).
Table 4.1 presents current level of GHG emissions in «Energy» and  «Industrial processes», and 
their projections according to Baseline  (Business as Usual)  scenario. This scenario is treated as  
hypothetic scenario, where the characteristics for most of   the technologies   in   energy  
resources  usage and  household consumption, and also at any stage of goods or services 
production,  stay unchanged by 2050, i.e. stay as they were as of  2012. It should be underscored, 
that   technologies are replaced only when useful life of current capacities expires.  The cost and 
efﬁciency of technologies replacing the outdated ones are compliant with modern level: with the 
time the cost is decreasing, while efﬁciency is growing.  Calculation of GHG emissions according 
to such business as usual scenario is useful, as it enables to perform calculations under alterna-
tive scenarios, i.e. the effectiveness of measures and policies, which stimulate technological 
change in economy and result in its de-carbonization.

35In accordance to baseline scenario, under almost unchanged technical parameters of energy 
technologies, increase in GHG is taking place as growth in economy is assumed  to take place 
primarily in consequence to restoration and  growth in the industrial output. The model includes 
assumption that average annual GDP growth rates over 2016-2050 will amount to 4%, which 
means that by 2050 GDP will show a fourfold increase. Ukrainian population will shrink from 45.2 
millions of people in 2014, to 38.9 million in 2050. Over 2014-2050 oil and gas prices will grow by 
35% and 60%, respectively. In addition, the Baseline scenario conditions do not envision 
enhanced environmental constraints. 
Quantitative model calculations of GHG emissions reduction under Baseline scenario   are 
performed with the help of economic-mathematical optimization model of energy ﬂows of 
Ukraine (model TIMES-Ukraine). This very model is also used to calculate reduction in GHG 
emissions when policies and measures on energy de-carbonization, included into Catalogue of 
policies and measures of low emissions development (hereafter Catalogue) are implemented. 
The Catalogue is based on best global practices and current legal framework, and was put 
together through broad consultations with representatives of Government authorities, business 
Ukrainian and international experts, scientists and public. 
Dynamic General Equilibrium Model with extended  energy block was used to estimate the 
social and economic outcomes of Ukraine's energy decarbonization policies and measures 
implementation. Uniﬁcation of the said two models was performed through application of the 
same assumptions with regard to economic growth rate, in particular, aggregated GDP growth 
rate.  
4.1. Energy de-carbonization policies and measures  
In the Catalogue policies and measures were grouped by function and sector, of which targeting 
de-carbonization are the following trends:
1 Energy efﬁciency – includes policies and measures which aim to increase efﬁciency in 
the use of energy resources and energy saving  accompanied with enhanced quality in energy 
services and energy resources supply;
2 Renewable energy – includes policies and measures which aim to support and stimu-
late the renewable energy development in Ukraine;
3 Modernization and innovation  – includes policies and measures which aim to mod-
ernize the ﬁxed assets used in traditional energy (energy resources generation, transition and  
consumption) and implementation of innovation  technologies (such as smart networks, indus-
trial production and use of hydrogen etc.);
4 Market transformation and institutions – includes business measures, which directly 
or indirectly affect structural shifts in economy and in goods and services markets; regulatory 
and management practices at the national and sector level; standards and codes; public aware
36ness measures; policy on education, science and technology development.
For each of the above given group developed are the GHG reduction scenarios based on full imple-
mentation of respective policies and LEDS measures.  
4.1.1. Energy efﬁciency  
Implementation of policies and measures which aim to increase efﬁciency in the use of energy 
resources and energy saving  accompanied with enhanced quality in energy services and energy 
resources supply will enable to cumulatively reduce GHG emissions over 2012-2050 by 3 677 
million tons of СО2-еequivalent  compared to Baseline scenario. The growth pace in GHG emis-
sions will show substantial reduction compared to Baseline scenario. According to «Energy 
efﬁciency scenario, » in 2050 the share of GHG emissions will amount to 53% of 1990 level (table 
4.2).

Substantial intensiﬁcation of renewable energy sources will make a signiﬁcant contribution to 
energy efﬁciency measures, which aim to de-carbonize the energy sector. In particular, modeling 
results show, additional - in contrast to “Energy efﬁciency” scenario - reduction of GHG emis-
sions by 2430 million tons of СО2-equivalent could be achieved cumulatively over the 2012-
2050 period, compared to Baseline scenario. Thus, the share of GHG emissions will amount to 
33% of the 1990 level, which will not signiﬁcantly exceed the 2015 level (table 4.3).

524.2.  Model assessment of social and economic outcomes 
Assessments of economic outcomes of low carbon policies and measures show that their imple-
mentation is characterized with generally positive macroeconomic effects (Figure 4.5). Boosted 
investment processes is the main factor  that  triggers quality changes, which in turn,  result  in 
the raised efﬁciency in production owing to lower speciﬁc consumption of energy resources. 
Increased efﬁciency in technology and production processes contribute to additional cumula-
tive growth in the goods and services output (6%) and GDP (13%) by 2050.   
Enhanced productivity and increased output have positive affect on real income of households. 
It is expected that by 2035 additional increase in household consumption can amount to 8%, and 
will reach 13% by 2050.

Figure 4.6. Changes in the goods and services output by the industry (percentage baseline scenario)
Overall, de-carbonization of Ukraine's energy sector will result in positive social and economic 
outcomes. Speciﬁcally, it is expected that GDP and real income of household will show additional 
growth. Under increase in total goods and services output, the share of economic activities with 
high gross value added will be growing at the industry level. Reduced scope of fossil fuels con-
sumption will contribute to increased level of national energy security and lowered import 
dependency.  
In 2050, given the policies and measures of Ukraine's energy sector de-carbonization are imple-
mented,  GHG emissions in «Energy» and  «Industrial processes»  will be expected  to stay within  
31-34%  of 1990 level or 260-285 million tons of СО2-equivalent.

58In 2015 methane emissions in Ukraine amounted to 62.7 million tons of СО2-
equivalent, which is by 67.1% lower than in 1990.  The largest sources of СН4 
i
(61%)  emissions are coal mines, as well as the processes of oil and natural gas 
extraction, transportation, storage and consumption. In agriculture emissions 
amount to 21%, in wastes treatment sector to 18%.
Nitrogen oxide emissions in 2015 totaled at 37.21 million tons of СО2-
equivalent, which is by 43.3% lower compared to 1990. Producing over 85% 
nitrogen oxide emission agriculture is a prevailing source of such emissions in 
Ukraine.

! of crises in the market due to reduced production of oil,  decrease in import of  
essential raw materials and low depth of raw materials processing (only at the 
level  55%) due to outdated equipment and substantial worn out of production 
facilities. Ukraine needs to update its technological support in oil reﬁneries to 
93% level of oil processing.  
5.2.  Improvement of waste treatment 
In this sphere, the policy aims to create preconditions, which will enable to increase the share of 
SHW utilization, to maximize their re-introduction in economy as secondary resources. Through 
waste generation reduction programs, this policy will facilitate reduction in the scope of waste 
from residential, commercial and administrative sectors. Decreasing generation of waste imme-
diately at the source of its original generation helps to reduce the GHG emissions from both 
waste burial, and from upstream production processes along manufacturing chain. In addition, 
GHG emissions associated with SHW transportation will be reduced.

5.3.  Agriculture  
Methane and nitrogen oxide are main GHG emissions produced by Ukraine's agriculture.  Their 
sources include digestive fermentation by grazing animals - CH4; cleaning, collection and usage of 
manure - CH4 and N2O, agriculture used land – N2O , which comes from application of nitrogen 
containing fertilizer (nitrogen fertilizer, manure, plant residues).

66.1. Land use and forestry sector and its contribution to GHG balance    
Ukraine occupies the territory of 60354. 9 thousand hectares or 0.4% of the Earth surface, of 
which the land amounts to 57928. 5 thousand hectares. Ukraine owns 8.7% of the world stock of 
black soil, 2.3% of cropland (8th in the world) and 2.2% of basal area under cereal crops. 
Agricultural use lands take almost 70% of Ukraine's territory, forests and other lands, covered in 
woods and bushes vegetation - 17.6%, and settlement land constitute 4.2%. Fig. 6.1 shows the

Forests is the main sink of GHG emissions in LULUCF sector. According to the State register of 
Ukraine's  forests,  the  total  territory  of  forest  resource  is  10.8  million  hectares  including 
reclamative afforestation. Prevailing in Ukraine is the State form of forest ownership; about 87% 
of forests are managed by State entities and organizations.  The sector's speciﬁc feature includes 
imbalanced land usage structure, excessive ploughness of territory, and low level of forest cover 
of the territory (average forest cover in Ukraine amounts to 15.9%, while that in European coun-
tries is 37%).
LULUCF sector contribution to total emission/absorption balance is positive. According to 
National Cadaster of anthropogenic emissions from sources and absorption of greenhouse 
gases absorbers over 2015 in Ukraine the sector absorbed about 5% of the total GHG emissions. 
In absolute terms, for the period 2010 - 2015 the level of absorption in the sector stayed within 
the range of 13-30 million t СО2 equivalent per annum. 
62Forestlands are net GHG absorbers - on average for the period 2010-2015 the scope of GHG 
absorption by forests amounted to 65.5 million t of СО2 equivalent per annum. GHG emissions 
in the sector were mostly coming from croplands, pastures, wetlands, settlements and other 
lands. The scope of GHG emissions from croplands on average totaled at 38.8 million t СО2 
equivalent per annum (Fig. 6.2).

6436.2  Low carbon policies and measures in land development and forestry 
Forest cultivation, sustainable forestry and reduction in the loss of forest cover are the most 
appropriate activities to increase GHG emissions absorption in LULUCF sector. Of agricultural 
practices, the optimum include non-exhaustive farming, cattle grazing and organic soil restora-
tion. Ukraine's speciﬁc feature include  imbalanced land usage structure,  excessive ploughness 
of territory, and also low level of forest cover of the territory (average forest cover in Ukraine 
amounts to 15.9%, while that in European countries is 37%). 
Within the territories of cities and other inhabited localities, the total area of green planting of all 
types as of 01.01.2015 amounted to 652, 1 thousand hectares. 
Ukraine belongs to the group of countries with the highest share of agricultural lands in its total 
area of – 70.8% as of 01.01.2015, including agricultural arable lands – 68.8%, pastures and hey 
ﬁelds– 13.0%.
LEDS policies and measures in LULUCF sector  
1 Optimizing the land use structure, increase in the forest area, wood lines 
and green plants, enhancement of interagency coordination  
Policies and measures aim to:
reduce cropland in the land use structure; 
increase the area of lands covered with forest vegetation, to create new forests (afforestation) 
and to timely restore the forests (reforestation);
Rationally place forests and declarative afforestation, which constitute ecological carcass in 
the landscape, and restore ﬁeld protection strips and other types of declarative afforestation;
to take stock of green vegetation in the inhabited localities, assess their status and carbon 
sequestration; 
to green the inhabited localities, which implies to incentivize measures of support and 
improvement  the status of trees and plants in residential areas of inhabited localities, to increase 
plants density in urban environment via creating of public and  curtilage gardens,  green roofs, 
and to plant  different types of vegetation to enable sequestration and uptake of accumulated 
carbon; 
to enhance interagency coordination, in particular, among forestry, agriculture etc. 
2 Improvement the practices of economic activities in LULUCF sector   based on 
climate    friendly  methods  of    farming  and  forest  management  -  Climate  Smart 
Agriculture, Climate Smart Forestry
64Policy and measures aim to: 
implement and support best practices of farming and forest management, which take due 
account of climate change and aim to prevent carbon take out  from soils in agrocoenosis,  
increase the level of forest productivity and resilience, to preserve and accumulate carbon in 
forest  phytomass and soil; 
to improve conservation and protection of forests and conservation areas, green vegetation 
in the inhabited localities, conservation of ﬁeld protection forest strips and other reclamative  
afforestation to  store the accumulated (sequestered) carbon; 
to introduce economic incentives of land user (owner) to rationally use and protect agricul-
tural lands;
to combat degradation of agricultural lands and desertization, including via conservation of 
low productive and technologically polluted lands;
to improve methods of agro technical regulation of carbon content in soil, which  means  
promotion  implementation of innovative agri-technologies, geared towards preservation and 
improvement of fertility, non-alkalic cultivation and rotation of crops; to lower mechanical 
impact on the soil;
to support measures which aim to transform low productive agricultural lands  into lands 
with permanent plantation cover, such as meadow/pasture, garden or forest where the carbon 
content in the soil and/or biomass will increase;
to reduce the rate of agricultural lands transformation into build-up lands, as this will help to 
uptake carbon in the soil of such land and also keep their carbon sequestration potential.
3 Development and implementation of national forestry development program 
with the engagement of the best international experience 
National Forestry development program will include the following components: policy and 
strategy (set of the national and regional forest policy, goals and ways to achieve them, assign-
ment of responsibilities, connectivity with other sector policies in the sphere of land use and 
climate change); legislation (laws which will enable policy implementation, regulatory frame-
work); institutions (organizations for decision making preparation and implementation – forest 
administrations, civic organizations, professional association and NGO, R&D institutions, educa-
tional institutions and media); information, communication and research (stock taking and 
monitoring of forests,  forest information system, collection, exchange and dissemination of 
information on  forests, including information  on climate change and vulnerability; research of 
biophysical, social and political aspects related to forest problems and climate change; reports 
to national and international organizations; communication and awareness raising work  for 
interested groups  and general public); competence  (knowledge and experience, which make it 
possible to efﬁciently respond  to climate change produced challenges in forestry  and ability to 
65efﬁciently resolve the tasks related to planning, management and economic activities); ﬁnancial 
mechanisms (mechanisms which are used to ﬁnance forestry, mechanisms for attraction, 
management and allocation of ﬁnancial resources;  and control mechanisms).
4 Promotion of replacement of energy intense products made of metal, concrete, 
plastic etc.  With products made of wood grown under sustainable (balanced forestry). 
Implementation of such policy promotes the use of wood in which the absorbed carbon is 
conserved for such wood usage period. In addition to that, the policy will also contribute to 
reduction of GHG emissions in other sectors inconsequence to energy intense products being 
replaced with products made of metal, concrete, plastic with wooden products.
To efﬁciently implement forestry potential as regards lows carbon development applied shall 
forestry methods which factor in the climate change in accordance to Climate Smart Forestry. 
Key elements to this concept of forestry include the following: 
application of «triune» approach  - absorption (sink ), sequestration (deposing) and replace-
ment; 
establishment of new political incentives; 
due account of  regional (local) speciﬁc features of forests in the process of climate preven-
tion measures implementation and adaptation thereto; 
interaction in solving the climate change problems and other challenges (such as develop-
ment of bio economics, food safety, rural areas, recreation, tourism, biodiversity );
synergy in  climate change prevention and adaptation thereto.
6.3  Projections of GHG emissions absorption dynamics under different scenarios of 
Ukraine's forestry sector development  
Projections of GHG emissions absorption dynamics under different scenario of Ukraine's forestry 
sector development are based on the outcomes of international project SCEFORMA «Scenario 
analysis of forestry management in Check Republic, Hungary, Poland and Ukraine». 
Analysis of Ukraine's forestry sector development scenarios was performed with the help of the 
model of European Forest Institute EFISCEN based on processing information for each forest 
plot, which is included in the database of the State Forest Agency of Ukraine «Forest Fund of 
Ukraine». General modelling scheme included assessments of the following:
Natural growth in forest stand;
66Natural growth in forest stand;
Scope of wood substance, harvested in course of cutting
(main use, care felling and forest sanitation felling);
Losses of wood substance due to adverse factors such (ﬁres, pests, diseases etc…);
Forest regeneration ( forest restoration and afforestation);
The scope of GHG absorption in the forests is projected based on two main scenarios of Ukraine's 
midcentury forestry development - «business as usual, » scenario developed on the basis of 
expert modiﬁcation of previous and modern trends in economic and social development, and 
«forward looking scenario,» which envisions achievement of forestry and natures protection 
activities targets in accordance to government strategies deﬁned priorities and programs. The 
third, additional scenario, made it possible to estimate the scope of GHG absorption in the 
process of forest cultivation (afforestation) in the area of million 1.4 hectare, which, given the 
“forward looking” scenario implementation shall by 2050 ensure increase in Ukraine's forest 
cover up to 19.4% and approximate it to optimum level. The State Forest Service of Ukraine set 
up the above presented scope of forest cultivation and forest cover targets in the course of 
drafting «Ukraine forests 2010-2015 State program. »
«Forward looking scenario, » envisioned support to protection, environment protection and 
recreations functions of forests, introduction of improved forest management regime (imple-
mentation of close to nature forestry, changes in the ages of ﬁnal felling operations, roll out of 
target forest calculation etc...). According to «forward looking» scenario, the forest areas 
intended for nature protection, recreation and safeguard purposes is increased,  yet they are not 
fully excluded  from wood usage. Final felling operations (or forest restoration fellings) shall be 
restricted by higher felling age, conservation methods and technologies and reduced cutting 
areas. It should be underscored, that the felling areas increase gradually.  Such a strategy is 
justiﬁed given additional beneﬁts provided by protection, recreational and environmental 
functions of forests. If «forward looking» scenario is implemented, because of forest cultivation 
(afforestation) it is expected that the area of forest covered lands will gradually increase from 
15.9% to 17%.
Dynamics in the GHG absorption scope in Ukrainian forests was calculated in accordance to 
above-mentioned scenarios. Calculations includes determination of carbon sequestration  in 
forest phytomass, dead wood substance forest litter vegetation ( without including carbon in 
forest soil, as it is assumed that under unchanged land use, the lands which are permanently 
covered  with forest vegetation retain stable stock of carbon.)
According to «business as usual» scenario, by 2050 a gradual decrease in phytomass growth in 
the forests is expected mostly due to the age change in forest structure, which will bring about a 
gradual decrease in the GHG absorption level. It is expected that by 2050 the annual GHG 
absorption level will decrease by 26% compared to 2012, and will amount to about 44.4 million t 
СО2 per year (Table 6.1).

Implementation of «forward looking» scenario will contribute to improvement in the forest age 
structure on account of new forests creation and optimization of forestry system (differentiation 
of felling ages, reduction in the area of clear felling operations and increase in the area of selec-
tive and gradual felling in ﬁnal felling, improvement in forests security and protection from pests, 
diseases and ﬁres). According to «forward looking» scenario forest cultivation will be performed 
at the area covering around 690 thousand hectare, which will  enable to increase Ukraine's forest 
cover up to 17%, as per the Law of Ukraine   dated 21 December 2010, № 2818-VI «On 
Foundations (Strategy) of the State Environmental Policy of Ukraine for the Period through 
2020.»
Implementation of «forward looking» scenario will enable to gradually by 2030 adjust forest age 
structure even though it may take about 50 more years to reach the optimum age structure.  
According to this  scenario biomass growth, as is the case  of  «business as usual» scenario, will 
also decrease due to objective reasons related to dynamics in the age structure of  forests, yet 
the decrease will not be substantial. Decreased growth in phytomass will result in reduced 
annual GHG absorption levels in forest phytomass by 16% compared to 2012.  In 2050, СО2 
absorption is projected to reach 50.4 million t per annum (Table 6.2).

Achievement of 19.4% of forest cover in Ukraine;
Implementation of «forward looking» scenario (forest cultivation at the area of 690 thousand 
hectare) with parallel afforestation in the area of 1.45 million hectares, as per Forest Cultivation 
Strategy in Ukraine, drafted in 2015 as a part to FAO Project «Consolidation of Ukraine's  Forest 
Policy.»
Additional forest cultivation will enable to increase GHG absorption level by 3.5 million t of СО2-
equivalent, and further on the absorption level at forest cultivation lands will increase owing to 
phytomass growth in the newly created forests. Given that «forward looking scenario with 
optimum forest cover, » is implemented, the scope of GHG absorption will stabilize after 2035 at 
the level of 85% of 1990 (Table 6.3).
