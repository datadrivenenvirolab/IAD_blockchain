Introduction 
 
This  “Long-term  Strategy  under  the  Paris  Agreement”  (hereinafter  “this 
strategy”)  is  formulated  by  the  Government  of  Japan  as  long-term  low 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission development strategy in accordance with the 
provision1 of the Paris Agreement2. 
Extreme weather events such as heavy rain have become more frequent with 
global warming due to the increase of GHG concentrations. From now on, natural 
disasters such as torrential rains are projected to become more frequent and 
intensified, and we have strong concerns about their impacts on our future 
generation.  Against  these  backgrounds,  countries  in  the  world  including 
developed countries are beginning to take steps towards decarbonization, not 
only in the areas of technologies but also international rule formulations, by 
striving for rule-making that are conducive to their own industrial structures, while 
businesses  are  also  starting  efforts  to  enhance  competitiveness  by  utilizing 
decarbonization technologies. Our future measures for climate change are equal 
to our response to a formidable challenge of breaking away from excessive 
dependency on fossil fuels that have underpinned modern civilization since the 
Industrial Revolution. On one hand, such a challenge carries the potential for 
transforming industrial structures that have been formulated so far; any mistakes 
in responding to the change may lead to the loss of industrial competitiveness. 
On the other hand, the challenge may provide Japan with an opportunity to create 
new growth industries, once we can lead the international rule-making and utilize 
our  decarbonization  technologies  to  solve  the  problems  facing  the  world, 
particularly Asia.  
Furthermore, the ongoing historical crisis of COVID-19 pandemic, facing the 
whole world including Japan, has presented us a common global challenge to 
prevent infections, while maintaining socio-economic activities in a compatible 
manner. In light of the recognition that we are living in a major turning point of the 
era, what is required is not to simply return to the world before the COVID-19 
pandemic, but to realize a transformation to a sustainable and resilient social 
system. Around the world, there have been ongoing initiatives of green recovery 
that aim to raise ambition in climate actions and realize sustainable economy and 
society  in  the  context  of  economic  recovery  from  the  spread  of  COVID-19 
infection. A  new  crisis  of  COVID-19  pandemic  has  transformed  the  world’s 
economy and society to a great degree. This also requires us to promote climate 
                                                   
1 Article 4, Paragraph 19 of the Paris Agreement: Parties should strive to formulate and 
communicate long term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies, mindful of 
Article 2 taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and 
respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances. 
2 Adopted in December 2015(came into effect in November, 2016).

change  measures  in  a  way  that  is  integrated  with  our  response  to  such a 
transformation. In parallel to that, we need to promote the transition from a linear 
economy  based  on  mass  production,  consumption  and  waste,  to  a  circular 
economy including through preserving biodiversity and utilizing nature-based 
solutions (NbS3 ), from the perspective of enhancing sustainable and resilient 
economy and society.  
Japan will strongly promote the “re-design” of its economy and society to 
make  it  sustainable  and  resilient,  through  accelerating  green  growth  by 
innovation and “three types of transitions,” namely towards “a decarbonized 
society,” “a circular economy” and “a decentralized society,” in order to rebuild its 
hurt economy while aiming at the solution of environmental problems, thereby 
achieving a society where the future generations can live in prosperity. At the 
same  time,  in  local  regions,  Japan  will  realize  the  aforementioned  three 
transitions through renewed community building based on the idea of “Circular 
and Ecological Economy,” so as to transform the ways of life into ones that are 
comfortable, convenient, as well as sustainable.

utilizing functions possessed by healthy nature ecosystems.

Chapter 1: Basic Concepts 
 
1. Intent and Purpose of Formulating this Strategy 
 
In response to the urgent challenge of climate change, efforts to balance 
emissions and removals of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the second half of 
this century have been accelerated all over the world. Against this backdrop, the 
Paris Agreement and other related decisions stipulates that all parties should 
strive to formulate and communicate long-term low GHG emission development 
strategies. Determined to lead global decarbonization, Japan will demonstrate its 
high aspiration and its stance to actively promote efforts for decarbonization both 
in and out of Japan.  
In particular, pursuing efforts to limit the average temperature increase to 
1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels is set as a global target in the Paris Agreement.  
The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C (officially titled An IPCC 
special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial 
levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of 
strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable 
development, and efforts to eradicate poverty, published in October, 2018) finds 
out that there will be significant difference in the expected impacts between by 
the temperature rise of 1.5 °C and 2 °C. The Working Group I (WGI) contribution 
to the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) (published in August, 2021) finds 
out that even the temperature rise of 1.5 °C will increase the frequency and 
intensity of extreme events such as high temperatures, while it also finds out that 
if the temperature rise is limited to 1.5 °C, not 2 °C, the increase in frequency of 
droughts and heavy precipitation as well as the extent of change in average 
rainfalls will be less severe. With the recognition of these, it will be an urgent task 
for the world to pursue efforts to limit the global average temperature rise to below 
1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. As a member of the international community, 
Japan will contribute to the world by formulating this long-term strategy and 
sharing  the  experiences  out  of  its  implementation,  thereby  contributing  to 
achieving the aforementioned target set forth in the Paris Agreement. 
 
2. Japan’s Long-term Vision 
 
Japan aims to reduce GHGs to net-zero, that is, to realize carbon neutrality 
by 2050, based on the idea that addressing climate change is no longer a 
constraint on economic growth and that proactive climate change measures bring 
transformation of industrial structures as well as its economy and society, leading 
to dynamic economic growth. By the Act Partially Amending the Act on Promotion 
of Global Warming Countermeasures in 204th session of the Diet (Act No. 54 of 
- 3 - 
  
2021) (Hereinafter the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures 
(Act No. 117 of 1998) amended by this law is called “The Amended Act on 
Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures”) which was enacted in the 204 
sessions of the Diet, net-zero by 2050 became a Basic Principle of the Act. The 
legislative amendment will enhance the continuity and predictability of policies 
and accelerate efforts and investments as well as innovation for decarbonization 
towards not only the achievement of the mid-term target, but also the realization 
of a decarbonized society. 
This strategy presents long-term sector-by-sector visions as “ideal future 
models” towards the realization of net-zero by 2050. These visions will provide 
directions for all stakeholders to pursue possibilities towards the realization of the 
target. Together with  policy directions, they will  improve the predictability of 
investment and serve as the basis for expanding the investment in Japan. At the 
same  time,  it  identifies  areas  which  need  disruptive  innovation  to  promote 
corporate research and development (R&D) and investment. Furthermore, by 
setting  forth    these  visions,  Japan  will  take  the  lead  in  future  international 
discussions including the formulation of frameworks and standards in the area of 
climate change. 
Japan aims to reduce its GHG emissions by 46 percent in FY 2030 from its 
FY2013 levels, setting an ambitious target which is aligned with the long-term 
goal of achieving net-zero by 2050. Furthermore, Japan will continue strenuous 
efforts in its challenge to meet the lofty goal of cutting its emissions by 50 percent. 
From now on and towards 2030, Japan will work on various measures including 
technology development, all of which will be in line with the goal of net-zero by 
2050. On the way to FY2030, Japan will make the best use of the existing 
technologies to achieve this ambitious goal. On this basis, towards net-zero by 
2050, Japan will strive to develop and diffuse decarbonization technologies that 
are yet to be widely deployed, by further expanding and deepening the efforts for 
the FY2030 target. Meanwhile, it is difficult at this stage to accurately estimate 
the outcome of the technology development or innovation to fulfill the 2050 goal. 
Thus, it is necessary to determine and update priorities in climate measures and 
technology development by constantly reflecting the up-to-date information, while 
keeping ambition of the 2050 net-zero target. Also important is to keep our mind 
open to all possibilities and to strive to utilize every available technology, aiming 
at achieving the updated emission reduction target for the FY2030 as well as the 
ambitious goal of net-zero by 2050.

3. Six Perspectives on the Net-Zero by 2050 
 
(1) Policy Implementation Based on the Best Available Sciences 
 
Japan’s long-term goal of achieving net-zero by 2050 is presented as being 
consistent with the best available sciences from the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) and others. 
The IPCC is an inter-governmental organization in which 195 countries and 
regions participate. It formulates and publishes Assessment Reports about every 
seven years and Special Reports on an ad-hoc basis. Every IPCC report is 
compiled based on numerous existing literatures. Each Party reviews the draft 
report and, then, gives it approval by consensus at IPCC Sessions to finalize the 
report. Following a series of the IPCC reports published so far, knowledge has 
been improved and strengthened about the possibility that the main factor in 
global warming since the twentieth century is anthropogenic. The Working Group 
I contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), published in August, 2021, 
provides a finding that it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the 
atmosphere, ocean and land. This will be subsequently followed by contributions 
of the Working Group II on impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation, those of the 
Working Groups III on climate change mitigation, and a Synthesis Report, all of 
which are expected to present important knowledge that will form a basis for 
future policies. 
 
(2) Realization of a Virtuous Cycle of the Economy and the Environment 
 
Addressing  environmental  issues  is  no  longer  a  constraint  on  economic 
growth. It is needed to adjust people’s mindset to a paradigm shift that proactive 
climate change measures bring transformation of industrial structures as well as 
economy  and  society,  leading  to  dynamic  economic  growth.  Environmental 
measures are the keys to transforming the industrial structure and producing 
robust growth by dramatically changing our economy and society, promoting 
investments, and enhancing productivity, while the Government takes on the role 
in  formulating  the  overall  framework  of  our  climate  policy  measures  and 
coordinating implementation of them.  
With recognition that the world has entered the era of great competition in 
decarbonization,  it  is  essential  as  well  for  Japan’s  growth  strategy  to  keep 
acquiring  technologies  and  markets  in  the  field  for  decarbonization  that 
constitutes one of the important investment areas worldwide. 
On the pathway to realizing net-zero by 2050, Japan will set high targets and 
fully mobilize all possible polices for industries with expected growth potentials  
- 5 - 
  
and focus on regulatory reform and standardization, demand creation through 
financial market, as well as price reductions through scaling up private investment. 
With these measures in place, the Government will support private investment, 
facilitate the use of existing savings worth 240 trillion yen, thereby attract global 
environment-related investment to Japan that are estimated as the level of 3,500 
trillion yen, and then, drive job creation and economic growth.   
Together with that, Japan will bring about socio-economic transformation that 
can create demand for carbon neutrality, including through new-style regional 
development and a shift in people’s lifestyles. In response to the progress of 
aging society with a declining birthrate, efforts in regional revitalization have been 
going forward, under which each local region aims for an autonomous and 
sustainable society by utilizing its own strengths. The most important thing for 
regional revitalization is the development of diverse societies in the regions by 
unleashing and exploiting their individual potentials. Japan will therefore work 
towards unveiling and using regional resources that may become a source of its 
future growth and development.  
As mentioned in the above, while environmental measures are transforming 
the economy and society, such socio-economic reforms, in turn, exert impacts on 
climate  change  mitigation.  The  following  examples,  such  as  the  shift  in 
consumption pattern from price-focused to quality-focused, the development of 
digital technologies, the transition to a circular economy and a decentralized 
society, and the change in workstyles, will all contribute to the realization of 
carbon neutrality. By accelerating this economic and social transformation from 
the standpoint of climate policy measures, Japan will aim at significantly reducing 
GHG  emission  while  realizing  the  virtuous  cycle  of  the  economy  and  the 
environment. 
 
(3) Just Transition of the Workforce 
 
Actions  for  carbon  neutrality  will  inevitably  entail  unparalleled  and 
unprecedented efforts. In industrial sectors there exist a number of companies 
that  need  fundamental  changes  in  their  business  models  and  strategies. 
Nonetheless, this also provides an opportunity to lead the new era. While the 
development  of  new  products  and  services  may,  to  a  certain  extent,  have 
negative impacts as well as positive ones on relevant industries, the Government 
will proactively support the efforts, for instance, by intermediate and small to 
medium-sized suppliers which have formerly produced derailleurs for gasoline 
engines, to embark on a new challenge to produce motor parts for electric 
vehicles (EVs). 
In moving toward a decarbonized society, the Paris Agreement takes into 
account the imperatives of a “just transition of the workforce.” The “Solidarity and 
- 6 - 
  
Just Transition Silesia Declaration” was adopted at the 24th Conference of Parties 
to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP24) held 
in December, 2018 in Katowice, Poland, underlining the growing international 
recognition of the importance of just transition. 
It is important that a just transition is made with decent and human-centered 
work as well as improvement in productivity. Since many companies in Japan are 
rooted  in  localities,  a  comprehensive  consideration  on  transitioning  local 
economies and companies as well as the workforce will be required. While there 
may be challenges with these transitions, there will also be opportunities in terms 
of restructuring in the industry and thereby achieving a virtuous cycle of the 
economy and the environment. 
Against this backdrop, the Government, local authorities and companies as 
well as financial institutions will work together to provide vocational training to the 
workforce, support for diversification and shifts in business operations, support 
for inviting new business and replacement of the labor force, in order to achieve 
the transition of the workforce to a decarbonized society smoothly and without 
delay. Such efforts also include support to local societies and economies for their 
smooth transitions. 
Specifically,  the  support  will  be  provided  for  the  industrial  structural 
transformation associated with net-zero by 2050. For example, the Government 
will mobilize support for proactive moves of shifting and reformulating business, 
such as in the case of engine parts suppliers which will take on a challenge to 
manufacture electric parts in line with the shift to electrification of automobiles, 
and gas stations and maintenance bases which will transform their business to 
hubs of new local human flow, logistics, and service bases, and/or EV stations.  
 
(4) Transformation in the Demand Side 
 
In their daily lives, people choose goods and services that fulfill their needs 
from a variety of choices, including methods of transportation, housing, energy, 
foodstuffs, leisure, etc., in consideration of convenience, availability, price, brand, 
and design. If they can choose such goods and services by taking  account of 
their entire lifecycle, from production to supply as well as their impact on the 
environment  and  locality  in  consumption  and  disposal,  that  would  create  a 
potential  to  significantly  reduce  carbon  footprints4  by  promoting  economic 
activities and sustainable regional development that impose less burden on the 
environment. In order to carry out technology-creating innovation and realize a 
decarbonized  society,  what  is  essential  will  be  “socio-economic  system

and processing, distribution and the supply of service, as to a variety to goods and services.

innovation” which enables technology diffusions, and “lifestyle innovation” which 
drives reforming lifestyles in sustainable ways by each one of the nations.  
Observation on Japan’s GHG emissions on the production basis5 reveals that 
the household emissions account for a small share of the total emissions, which 
mainly consist of emissions from the use of air conditioning, heating and hot water 
supply, as well as home appliances. On the other hand, when estimated based 
on the consumption basis (or carbon footprints), there is a report which points out 
that approx. 60 percent of the total emissions originates from the household 
sector6 . The Government will proceed with developing business environment 
which secures diversity in choice and provides necessary information, so that 
every actor can choose sustainable products and services. Furthermore, the 
Government will also undertake a review of market, infrastructure and institutional 
platforms  to  facilitate  efforts  by  the  demand  side,  including  in  the  areas  of 
procurement standards and visualization of efforts towards decarbonization. 
 
(5) Swift and timely measures by sectors and entities 
 
Once urban structures and infrastructures such as those from large-scale 
facilities and installations to houses are established, they have long-term impacts 
on GHG emissions. Bearing in mind that there is not so much time left by the year 
2050, it is necessary to consolidate efforts for decarbonization in the field of 
infrastructure which, once set in service, is utilized for a long period of time. Such 
efforts not only include energy savings for infrastructural services in the phase of 
provision and management, but also, from the perspective of entire lifecycle of 
infrastructures, the use of materials that contribute to limiting carbon dioxide 
(CO ) emissions and the R&D pertaining to reduced environmental impacts, at 
2
each phase of planning and designing, construction, replacement as well as 
demolition, while making efforts in monitoring the CO  emissions. 
2
From the business perspective, the speed of innovation is also a key to 
acquiring markets which emerges along with the progression in climate change 
measures worldwide. Furthermore, to accelerate decarbonization, urgent actions 
are required for local governments, local firms, and the national public, who are 
consumers of goods and services. With existing decarbonization technologies

already in place, it is still possible to realize decarbonization to a certain degree 
by thoroughly utilizing them. 
Mustering all available and necessary policy measures such as budget, tax 
systems,  finance,  regulatory  reform/standardization,  carbon  pricing  that 
contributes to growth and human resource development, Japan, from now on, will 
move to swiftly implement efforts for decarbonizaiton. 
 
(6) Contribution to the World 
 
Climate change is not an issue of one country; it is a global issue. Consistent 
with the principles of Sustainable Development Goals, adopted by the UN, and 
the Paris Agreement, reduction in GHG emissions is required all over the world. 
In particular, it is expected that a country like Japan, trusted worldwide for the 
quality of industrial products and the high standard of science and technology 
should contribute globally through the implementation of its long-term strategy. 
In order to realize a business-led virtuous cycle of the economy and the 
environment, as well as to drive global decarbonization, Japan will take the lead 
in providing a model and will embark on national efforts proactively. In order to 
contribute to reductions in GHG emissions worldwide, including in emerging and 
developing countries where economic growth and population explosions are 
expected,  Japan  aims  to  expand  business  opportunities  for  global 
decarbonization and to become the hub of technology, human resource and 
investment. 
 
4. Toward a Bright Society with Hope for the Future 
 
With the progress of global warming due to the increase of GHG emissions, 
the world has witnessed events such as heavy rains with increased frequency. In 
the future, further increase in frequency and intensification of weather events 
such as torrential rains are projected, arousing great concern about generational 
impacts in the future. The event of COVID-19 infection has reconfirmed the 
importance to build a society where the future generations can live in comfort, 
based on one of the basic policies of SDGs “No one left behind,” which includes 
those who are in vulnerable circumstances. In the post-COVID-19 era, it is 
essential to undertake proactive measures against climate change, which allows 
no time to lose and to redesign economy and society that are both sustainable 
and resilient. 
A decarbonized society for which this strategy aims should be a bright society 
with hope for the future. It is important to create an environment for each one of 
us to live healthy with sense of well-being and to work voluntarily and actively to 
create a sustainable society as parties concerned, by sharing the model of such 
- 9 - 
  
a society with as many stakeholders as possible, including the generation who 
will be in the middle of society at around 2050. 
A  bright  society  with  hope  for  the  future  may  differ  depending  on  the 
generation,  position  and  location.  For  that  reason,  it  is  important  for  each 
individual to envisage a model of society of its own, taking into account the 
following factors, to take actions and to share their vision of that society. 
 
(a) Achievement of SDGs 
Japan aims to maximize the co-benefits with all other SDGs than SDG 13 
on Climate Action in its transition to a decarbonized society. 
 
(b) “Co-creation” as a basis for continued innovation 
Sharing  the  need  for  long-term  social  reform,  repeated  interactions 
between various types of knowledge are expected to create innovations in a 
“co-creative” manner. 
 
(c) Working with Society 5.0 
Society 5.0, a society that solves social issues and creates value through 
the digital revolution and the integration of imagination and creativity of various 
people,  is  expected  to  contribute,  by  digitalization,  to  climate  change 
measures with cross-cutting interactions beyond areas such as energy and 
mobility. 
 
(d) Circular and Ecological Economy 
For Japan, where the population declines and the society ages with fewer 
children, it is important to set a growth strategy to strengthen the vitality of 
local communities. Therefore, Japan will aim at creation of the “Circular and 
Ecological Economy,” where each regional community makes the maximum 
use of regional resources in a sustainable manner to become self-reliant and 
decentralized, while connecting with a broader network of communities and 
striving for decabonization and SDGs with integrated improvements on the 
environment, economy and society in the region. This concept of sustainable 
regional community will also be presented to the world with a view to providing 
a role model for the international community. 
 
(e) Leading country in solving problems 
Japan aims to become a “leading country in solving problems" by sharing 
and applying the best practices from communities including cities and rural 
areas. 
Furthermore,  the  Government  will  support  each  stakeholder  including 
companies,  local  communities  and  citizens  in  sharing  awareness  for  a 
- 10 - 
  
decarbonized  society,  forming  a  future  vision  of  the  society  and  taking 
proactive action. At the same time, the Government will facilitate the shift in 
minds of Japanese citizens at all levels to lead them to take action with 
capacity building and public awareness campaigns to disseminate and share 
the knowledge of climate change and specific actions to solve the problem. 
When  doing  so,  the  Government  will  ensure  equity  between  the  future 
generation and current generation.

Chapter  2:  Long-term  Vision  of  Each  Sector  and  Direction  of  Policies  and 
Measures 
 
Section 1. Policies and Measures for Emissions Reductions 
 
1. Energy 
 
(1) Current status 
 
a.  Progress in the reduction of energy-related CO  emissions 
2
 
Energy-related CO  accounts for over 80 % of Japan's GHG emissions. 
2
Actions  of  Japanese  energy  sector  are  crucial  to  significantly  reduce  GHG 
emissions. 
The current level of energy-related CO  emission reductions is 1.24 billion 
2
tons in FY2013 and 1.03 billion tons in FY2019 respectively, a decrease at the 
pace of approximately 30 million tons per annum.  
To reduce energy-related CO  emissions, there is a need for low-carbonization 
2
in energy supplies -- increase of the non-fossil power ratio in electricity supplies 
and the shift to low carbon fuels in fossil fuel use -- and there is a need for energy 
efficiency (improved energy consumption efficiency) and for improvement in the 
electrification rates on demand side. The outlook of FY2030 for the particularly 
important non-fossil power ratios and energy efficiency is as follows: 
Figure 1 Breakdown of Japan's GHG emissions by gas type 
(FY2019, final figures) (Source: Compiled based on Japan's GHG Inventory) 
 
- 12 - 
  
(a) Non-fossil electricity 
 
The non-fossil power ratio is expected to reach approximately 59% of the 
energy mix7 in FY2030 by promoting the introduction of renewable energy and 
restarting nuclear power plants that are recognized to have met the world's 
strictest regulatory standards set by the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) etc. 
 
(b) Energy efficiency 
 
In the above-mentioned energy mix, the final energy consumption in FY2030 
is forecast to be approx. 280 million kl: a reduction of about 62 million kl expected 
with rigorous energy efficiency measures.  
 
b. Circumstances and future of energy in Japan 
 
It is important for Japan, envisaging a decarbonized society for its future, not 
only  to  have  ambitious  visions,  but  also  to  take  effective  measures  on  the 
circumstances it faces. Japanese energy sector is faced with a lack of domestic 
fossil resources such as oil, natural gas and coal, and is not equipped with 
international pipelines or interconnections. Dependence on the Middle East is 
extremely  high  among  major  economies. Although,  due  to  a  decline  in  the 
Japanese population, a quantitative growth in energy demand is not expected in 
the long-run, the quality demanded for electricity must be maintained. Japan is a 
mature economy with energy infrastructure (transmission lines, gas conduits, gas 
stations etc.) already in place nationwide. Energy efficiency is also extremely high, 
especially in the energy intensive industry. This has resulted in highly reliable 
energy technology, on which supply chains are based. However, the planned 
power outages and fuel supply stagnation resulting from the March 2011 Great 
East  Japan  Earthquake  and  the  large-scale  power  outages  linked  to  the 
September  2018  Hokkaido  Eastern  Iburi  Earthquake  were  a  reminder  of 
vulnerabilities in the existing energy infrastructures, posing risks to livelihoods 
and economy. 
                                                   
7 The outlook for energy supply and demand in FY2030; it shows the outlook for energy 
supply and demand on the ambitious assumption that various challenges in both aspects 
of supply and demand in promoting thorough energy efficiency measures and expansion 
of non-fossil energy will be overcome for 46% reduction in the light of the declaration that 
Japan aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 46% in FY2030 compared to 
FY2013, as an ambitious target which is aligned with the long-term goal of net-zero by 
2050, while continuing strenuous efforts in its challenge to meet the lofty goal of cutting 
its emission by 50%. 
- 13 - 
  
Given the points outlined above, it is important that measures are taken to 
address them under the Strategic Energy Plan8 based on S+3E9 as the basic 
principles on energy policy. Furthermore, it is important that efforts are made to 
achieve a decarbonized society, which is the ultimate goal.

(2) Future vision 
 
It is not easy to draw an accurate picture of the society realizing net-zero by 
2050 due to factors such as the possibility and uncertainty of technological 
development as well as the uncertainty of changes in the international political 
and economic situation. However, if we boldly depict the energy supply and 
demand structure of the carbon-neutral society on the basis of the current state 
of technology, following pictures would be envisaged: 
 
  Efficiency in energy consumption will be improved by thoroughly advancing 
energy  efficiency.  In  addition,  the  power  sector  will  be  decarbonized 
through introducing decarbonized power sources. Areas of the non-power 
sector that can be electrified will be electrified by decarbonized power 
sources. 
 
  In  the  industrial  sector,  decarbonization  will  be  promoted  through  the 
practical application of hydrogen-reduced iron making, CO  absorption 
2
type concrete, cement capturing CO , and artificial photosynthesis. On the 
2
other hand, in sectors such as with high-temperature heat demand where 
electrification is not feasible, decarbonization will be promoted through the 
use of hydrogen, synthetic methane, biomass, etc. 
 
  In the commercial and residential sectors, electrification will be promoted, 
and decarbonization will also be promoted through the use of renewable 
heat, hydrogen, synthetic methane, etc. 
 
  In  the  transport  sector,  decarbonization  will  be  promoted  through  the 
expanded introduction of EVs and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), along with the 
use of synthetic fuels that utilize CO . 
2
 
  Despite the progress in energy efficiency and decarbonization in each 
sector, there are some sectors where CO emissions are unavoidable. CO  
2  2
from those sectors can be removed by specific measures such as Direct 
Air  Carbon  Capture  and  Storage  (DACCS),  Bio-  Energy  with  Carbon 
Capture and Storage (BECCS), and forest sink measures. 
 
In order to realize such a society, efforts of the energy sector that accounts for 
over 80% of GHG emissions are required. However, realizing this vision will not 
be easy, given Japan's current situation such as the industrial structure where the 
manufacturing industry, which releases the large amount of CO , accounts for 
2
over 20% of the nation’s GDP, and the conditions for utilizing natural energy, such 
as the area of shallow oceans and vast plains, which are different from those in 
- 15 - 
  
other countries. It would not be easy to overcome difficulties to realize this vision 
without all-out efforts of the people in all sectors of society such as industries, 
consumers and the Government. 
On the other hand, as the difficulties in realizing carbon neutrality are common 
to many countries around the world, if Japan can find ways to overcome these 
difficulties as quickly as possible, that would bring it to a position to lead the 
world's efforts towards carbon neutrality. Thus, it is imperative to create a virtuous 
cycle of the economy and the environment by changing the people’s conventional 
mindset  and  proactively  working  towards  carbon  neutrality,  which  would 
transform the industrial structure, drive the socio-economic reform, and lead to 
the next strong growth. 
 
(3) Direction of policies and measures for the future vision 
 
Through the efforts towards net-zero by 2050, it is essential to support the 
economic activities by ensuring stable and cost-efficient energy supply on the 
major premise of safety.  
On this premise, Japan will address maximum introduction of renewable 
energy as major power sources on the top priority; societal implementation of 
hydrogen and CCUS10 will be promoted; and necessary amount of nuclear power 
will be continuously utilized on the major premise of ensuring safety and public 
trust. 
Including these efforts, Japan will pursue all options to realize net-zero by 
2050 by striving to maintain global competitiveness and to restrain natural burden 
by securing stable and cost-efficient energy supply. 
                                                   
10 CO2 Capture, Utilization and Storage.

Figure 4 Image of energy policy toward 2050 
 
a. Measures required in the power sector 
 
Among  various  economic  activities,  the  power  sector  has  utilized 
decarbonized power sources including renewable energy and nuclear that have 
already been at practical stage. Utilizing these power sources will be required to 
steadily realize decarbonization. 
In the society which has realized net-zero by 2050, electricity demand is 
expected to increase to a certain extent due to the progress of electrification in 
the industrial, commercial, residential, and transport sectors. In order to meet this 
demand, it will be difficult to meet 100% of the electricity demand with a single 
type of energy source. It will be necessary not only to utilize decarbonization 
technologies that are currently at the practical stage, but also to pursue new 
options that require innovation, such as hydrogen/ammonia power generation 
and thermal power generation with carbon storage and reuse by CCUS. 
 
(a) Renewable Energy 
 
In  order  to  realize  net-zero  by  2050,  promoting  electrification  and 
decarbonizing  power  sources  are  imperative.  Japan  will  address  maximum 
introduction of renewable energy as major power sources in 2050 on the top 
priority on the major premise of S+3E. 
- 17 - 
  
When  promoting  the  maximum  introduction  of  renewable  energy,  it  is 
necessary to secure grid capacity which connects regions with large renewable 
energy potential to large consumption areas, to deal with the fluctuating output of 
solar and wind power due to natural conditions, and to deal with grid constraints 
such  as maintaining  grid  stability  in  emergencies  including  in  power  supply 
dropouts. It is also necessary to respond to Japan's unique natural conditions and 
societal  constraints  such  as  the  limited  areas  of  flat  land,  and  to  promote 
coexistence  with  local  communities  by  ensuring  appropriate  communication, 
environmental considerations, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. 
In addition, as the cost of power generation remains high compared to the level 
of  international  standards,  it  is  necessary  to  reduce  the  cost  and  manage 
excessive natural burdens. 
In order to address these challenges, Japan will improve the flexibility of the 
power system through combining diverse resources including by formulating the 
master plan for the power grid, expanding the introduction of diverse distributed 
energy resources11  such as energy storage systems, securing decarbonized 
flexibility through the use of storage batteries and hydrogen, which play the key 
role in making renewable energy major power sources, promoting measures to 
ease  grid  congestion,  and  promoting  the  development  of  next-generation 
inverters which support grid stability. Japan will also promote the development of 
innovative technologies such as next-generation solar cells and floating offshore 
wind  power  generation,  which  are  indispensable  for  overcoming  location 
constraints and reducing costs. In addition, with respect to the Space Solar Power 
Systems (SSPS) which use wireless transmission and reception technology to 
supply electricity from space to the ground, Japan will steadily proceed with R&D 
as well as demonstration, including consideration of the transition from the ground 
demonstration phase to the space demonstration phase, by comprehensively and 
constantly assessing SSPS’s role as an energy supply source, its economic 
rationality, and its ripple effects on other industries, etc. 
                                                   
11  Distributed energy resources can be broadly classified into power generators such as 
variable renewable energy, cogeneration, and fuel cells, energy storages such as batteries, 
and demand-side resources such as large-scale factories and water electrolysers, and 
their scale varies from small to large-scale facilities.

(b) Nuclear Energy 
 
Having  experienced  the  accident  at  Tokyo 
Electric  Power  Company  Holdings’  (TEPCO) 
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, Japan 
will reduce the dependence on nuclear power as 
much as possible, while giving the highest priority to 
safety  and  expanding  decarbonized  renewable 
energy with economic independence. 
Figure 7 Takahama Power Station 
(Source: Kansai Electric Power) 
 
Nuclear power is a practical in-use option for decarbonization. On the one 
hand, some countries are planning to phase out nuclear power. Meanwhile, many 
efforts have been made to further enhance its safety, economic efficiency, and 
mobility in order to respond to the changing energy situation. 
In Japan, in order to regain public trust of nuclear power, it is essential to 
reduce accident risk by enhancing reactor safety, and to implement “back-end” 
related  activities  including  decommissioning,  processing  and  disposing  of 
radioactive waste. The Government will promote strengthening human resources, 
technology, and the industrial bases of nuclear power, and will pursue reactors 
with further safety, economic efficiency, and mobility and will promote R&D to 
resolve back-end issues. 
It is important to hold a responsible and sincere attitude and approaches that 
look back on the accident at TEPCO’s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station 
as the starting point. This is the key to gain public trust in nuclear power in Japan. 
 
(c) Hydrogen, Ammonia, CCS, and CCU/Carbon Recycling 
- 19 - 
  
 
In order to realize net-zero by 2050, it is necessary to promote ambitious and 
drastic changes in thermal power policies to reduce CO  emissions from thermal 
2
power generation to net-zero. At the same time, thermal power generation is an 
important power source that has supported stability and resilience in power 
supply since the Great East Japan Earthquake. Also, on the basis of the current 
state of technology, thermal power generation retains its important functions as a 
balancing power to compensate for the variability of renewable energy. It is 
imperative to replace these functions with decarbonized power sources, while 
ensuring stable supply. 
Therefore, in order to promote decarbonization of thermal power generation, 
the fuel itself will need to be converted to hydrogen or ammonia, and the CO  
2
released by thermal power generation will be necessary to be captured, stored, 
and reused. 
 
-  Actions to utilize hydrogen and ammonia 
 
Hydrogen  and  ammonia  power  generation  does  not  emit  CO   during 
2
combustion. It maintains the regulating and inertial power functions of thermal 
power, contributes to the stabilization of grid operations, and is applicable to many 
of the existing power generation facilities, such as gas turbines, boilers, and 
denitrification facilities, without modification. Therefore, hydrogen and ammonia 
power generation is one of the most important options for decarbonizing power 
sources  to  realize  carbon  neutrality. As  for  hydrogen  and  ammonia  power 
generation,  Japan  will  work  to  overcome  technical  issues  so  that  they  can 
function as major supply and regulating powers in the electric power system in 
2050. 
In order to expand the supply volume and reduce the supply cost of hydrogen, 
Japan  will  develop  and  demonstrate  technologies  that  will  contribute  to  the 
establishment of a large-scale international hydrogen supply chain by utilizing the 
Green  Innovation  Fund,  in  an  integrated  manner  with  the  establishment  of 
hydrogen power generation technologies, aiming to achieve a cost lower than, or 
equal to, gas-fired power generation in 2050.

-  Actions to utilize CCS 
 
As for CCS12, Japan will work to establish the technology, reduce the cost, 
develop suitable sites, and improve the environment for its commercialization, 
while formulating a long-term roadmap and sharing it with stakeholders. In order 
to establish CCS technology and reduce its cost, Japan will conduct R&D and 
demonstration  of  separation  and  capture  technology,  and  promote  R&D  on 
storage technology, elaboration and automation of monitoring technology, and 
cost reduction for drilling, storage, and monitoring. In addition, for the social 
implementation of cost-efficient, efficient, and flexible CCS, Japan will work on 
the demonstration of shipping liquefied CO , and promote the establishment of a 
2
model base for the optimization of the network (hubs and clusters) consisting of 
CO  emission sources and reuse/storage clusters in collaboration with the public 
2
and private sectors. 
With respect to the development of suitable sites, which are essential for the 
societal implementation of CCS, Japan will continue to conduct studies such as 
the evaluation of storage potential, taking into account economic efficiency and 
societal acceptability, in order to select suitable sites for CO  storage in Japan. In 
2
addition, while taking into account the trends of overseas CCS projects and other 
factors, Japan will work on improving the environment for the commercialization 
of CCS in Japan.

- 22 - 
  
-  Actions to utilize CCU/Carbon Recycling 
 
CCU/Carbon  Recycling  is  a  technology  that,  taking  CO   as  a  resource,  
2
recycles  CO   into  materials  and  fuels  through  mineralization  and  artificial 
2
photosynthesis, thereby reducing the emission of CO  into the atmosphere. This 
2
also has the advantage in that the installing CO  separation and capture facilities 
2
can contribute to the reduction of CO  emissions, simultaneously utilizing existing 
2
fossil fuel procurement systems and facilities. As international competition in the 
development of CCU/Carbon Recycling technology is accelerating, Japan is 
required  to  promote  the  development,  social  implementation,  and  global 
deployment of technologies for cost reduction and application development while 
ensuring competitive advantage, based on the "Roadmap for Carbon Recycling 
Technologies" (formulated by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry on 
June 7, 2019, and revised on July 26, 2021). 
Figure 11 Roadmap for Carbon Recycling Technologies 
(Source: Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) 
 
b. Measures required in the industrial, commercial, residential, and transport 
sectors 
 
In the industrial, commercial, residential, and transport sectors, in addition to 
improving  energy  consumption  efficiency  by  thorough  energy  efficiency 
measures, it is necessary to promote electrification in areas where electrification 
by decarbonized power sources is possible. On the other hand, the use of 
- 23 - 
  
hydrogen, synthetic methane, synthetic fuels, etc. and the implementation of 
innovative technologies will be essential for heat demand and manufacturing 
processes  where  electrification  is  difficult.  For  example,  hydrogen  can  also 
contribute  to  decarbonization  through  sector  coupling  by  converting  surplus 
renewable energy and other electricity into hydrogen and using it in the industrial, 
commercial, residential, and transport sectors. 
On the other hand, in the energy-intensive sector, unless innovations are 
practically realized such as hydrogen-reduced iron making, cement capturing 
CO , and artificial photosynthesis and manufacturing processes is drastically 
2
changed, carbon neutrality would not be able to be realized in Japan as a whole. 
Like endothermic reaction in hydrogen reduction process of hydrogen-reduced 
iron  making,  there  are  many  areas  of  challenge,  for  which  a  complete 
technological solution has yet to be found. Overcoming the challenges is not easy 
to achieve innovation. It is necessary to accelerate the efforts of both industry and 
the Government so that the realization of innovation will become the source of 
Japan's industrial competitiveness and that Japan will lead the world's action 
toward carbon neutrality. 
In addition,  as  in  the  high  temperature heat demand and manufacturing 
processes,  some  sectors  have  difficulty  in  complete  decarbonization,  the 
implementation of carbon removal technologies such as DACCS and BECCS will 
also be essential. It is necessary to pursue these technologies to realize net-zero 
by 2050. 
Towards 2050, it is required to aim to realize net-zero while pursuing all 
options, including not just the maximum use of established technologies such as 
cogeneration  to  further  improve  the  efficiency  of  heat  supply,  but  also 
technologies  such  as  hydrogen  and  ammonia  power  generation  that  are 
technically foreseeable but will require the construction of a new supply and 
demand network as well as significant cost reductions, and technologies that are 
still technically unproven and require technological development from now on, to 
the possible maximum extent.

As  indicated  in  the  "Green  Growth  Strategy  through  Achieving  Carbon 
Neutrality in 2050" (formulated on June 18, 2021 in cooperation with relevant 
government ministries and agencies13 , hereinafter referred to as the "Green 
Growth  Strategy"),  in  pursuing  these  innovations  with  an  eye  to  2050,  the 
Government will set high targets, focused on industrial sectors with high growth 
potential, create an enabling environment that makes it easy for the private sector 
to take on challenges, mobilize all kinds of policies, and verify and modify the 
policy measures that need to be taken through reviewing the progress. 
 
2. Industries14 
 
(1) Current status 
 
GHG emissions from the Japanese industries include energy-related CO  
2
from power generation and heat generation, non-energy-related CO  emitted 
2
from  industrial  processes  and  product  use,  methane,  nitrous  oxide,  and 
fluorinated gases (Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), PFCs, SF , NF ). 
6 3
Energy-related CO  accounts for the majority of industry emissions. The final 
2
figure for FY2019 stands at 384 million tons, reduced by 17.0% compared to 
FY2013. The industries have taken voluntary efforts based on their Action Plan 
for the Commitment to a Low Carbon Society15 and energy consumption at large.

15 As the world's interest and expectations for the realization of carbon neutrality in 2050 
increase further, Keidanren has newly positioned the realization of this goal as the most 
important goal to aim for in the future, and has changed the "Keidanren Low Carbon 
Society Action Plan" to the "Keidanren Carbon Neutral Action Plan".

At the same time, among the GHGs emitted from industrial processes and 
product uses, the figure for the four fluorinated gases in FY2019 amounts to 55.4 
million tons-CO eq16., with an increase of 41.7% compared to FY2013. This is 
2 
attributed to an increase in emissions of HFCs resulting from the substitution of 
refrigerant from ozone-depleting substances.

a. Characteristics of the industrial sector 
 
Because  Japanese  industrial  sector  is  broad-based  and  its  production 
volumes are large, it has two major characteristics from the perspective of GHG 
emissions.  The  first  is  the  existence  of  a  large  amount  of  CO   emissions 
2
generated by the utilization of high temperature heat and chemical reactions such 
as reduction reactions. Numerous emission intensive industries, including the 
metal, chemical and cement industries, require extremely high-temperature heat, 
from several hundred to over a thousand degrees Celsius. In many cases, fossil 
fuels provide the source for such energy, and they are not easily replaceable by 
the  likes of  CO -free  electricity  because  of economic,  caloric  and  structural 
2
reasons. Furthermore, for chemical reactions such as reduction reactions, the 
generation of the CO  is unavoidable as a matter of principle if existing industrial 
2
processes are followed. The second is the scale of emissions resulting from 
production volumes. In order that present living standards to be maintained and 
improved, a certain amount of production is considered necessary for many 
products. For example, approx. 100 million tons of steel is produced in Japan, 
while  global  production  amounts  to more than  ten  times  of  that. Therefore, 
attempts to replace steel with other existing products, may not be feasible due to 
supply-side restrictions. Even if it were possible, the problem of GHG emissions 
would still arise from the production process of alternative products. Furthermore, 
since it is possible to trade steel with foreign countries in terms of imports and 
exports, even if Japan reduced its manufacturing and the accompanying GHG 
emissions, it could merely increase overseas production and corresponding GHG 
emissions therein, effectively transferring them to another country. Such a case 
- 27 - 
  
would not help solving the fundamental problem on a global scale, and the 
continuation of domestic production with further effective emission reductions 
could be a more valid option. 
 
b. Voluntary initiatives by the industries 
 
Japanese industries have been taking initiatives since Keidanren (the Japan 
Business Federation) formulated the “Keidanren Voluntary Action Plan on the 
Environment” in June 1997, and each industry group has voluntarily set reduction 
targets prior to the development of national goals and taken measures. By March 
2019, 115 sectors formulated "The Commitment to a Low Carbon Society." They 
have taken measures in their own sector, and not only contributed to domestic 
emission reductions, but also to reductions in other sectors and overseas with 
eyes on global warming measures worldwide. 
In  June  2020,  Keidanren  launched  "Challenge  Zero,"  a  new  initiative  to 
strongly promote and encourage companies and organizations to take on the 
challenge of innovation toward the realization of a decarbonized society. By 
August 2021, 188 companies and organizations have joined "Challenge Zero" 
and have announced their specific innovation initiatives. Through this initiative, 
they will work on attracting ESG investment in companies which will take on the 
challenge of innovation toward decarbonized society, promoting collaboration 
among various industries, academia and the Government to create innovations.

c. Contributing to reductions through the global value chains (GVCs) 
 
For effective climate change measures, it is not only important to focus on the 
GHGs  emitted  in  the  manufacturing  and  supplying  phase  of  products  and 
services, but also consider reduction contribution through global value chains 
(GVCs), which cover all phases from the initial stage of procurement of resources 
and materials to distribution, usage by consumers, disposal and recycling. 
It is important to contribute to GHG reductions throughout the worldwide 
supply chains by promoting a “visualization” of the above-mentioned initiatives 
for emission reductions in GVCs and accelerating the development and usage of 
products and services with superior environmental performance. The Ministry of 
Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) considered basic approaches to visualizing 
the industries’ contributions to GHG reductions on their provision of goods and 
services,  and  formulated  the  “Guidelines  for  Quantifying  GHG  emission 
reductions of goods or services through Global Value Chain” in March 2018. 
Currently, the industries quantify their own contribution to reduction based on 
this Guidelines and provide information to stakeholders such as investors and 
consumers.  Furthermore,  the  industries  have  shared  the  above  concept  of 
contribution to reductions with the industries of the world, and through sharing 
and cultivating of this concept, are making efforts to contribute to the reduction in 
global emissions and further economic growth in Japan. To raise awareness of 
the importance of emissions reduction through GVCs both domestically and 
internationally,  in  November  2018  Keidanren  released  a  “Concept  Book”  by 
compiling cases of efforts by numerous business associations and companies to 
visualize the reduced amount of CO  associated to their products and services. 
2
 
d. Company initiatives based on long-term perspectives 
 
Keidanren has called on its member companies and organizations to consider 
their own long-term vision and provide information thereof. By July 2021, over 
260 companies and organizations have either formulated or are considering the 
formulation of their "long-term vision." 
Furthermore, with the progress in ESG finance, efforts are ongoing to identify 
and reduce GHG emissions throughout the entire supply chains and to encourage 
the active use of renewable energy. 
For example, recently there has been an increasing number of companies 
that set SBTs (Science Based Targets) focusing on mid-term reduction targets 
based  on  scientific  evidences  in  line  with  the  Paris Agreement  and  those 
- 29 - 
  
participated in RE 10017, aiming to achieve business operations with the 100% 
usage of electricity of renewable energy origin. 
 
(2) Future vision 
 
In order to promote decarbonization in the industrial sector and to realize 
carbon neutrality, it is necessary to improve efficiency in energy consumption by 
thoroughly improving energy efficiency, and promote electrification and energy 
conversion on demand side in conjunction with decarbonization on supply side to 
promote decarbonization of heat demand and manufacturing processes. 
In addition, in order for the industrial sector to aim for emission reductions in 
line with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement, it is necessary to take 
actions based on the perspectives indicated in Chapter 2, Section 1, 2. (1). To 
that end, challenges will be made to overcome the difficult problem that in many 
industries, there are no existing alternative processes that can be realistically 
adopted  from  technological  and  economic  standpoints;  new  alternative 
production  processes  will  be  established  with  disruptive  innovations  that  is 
heretofore unconventional and "decarbonized manufacturing" will be achieved. 
In the field of HFCs as well, Japan will address phasing-down of HFCs and 
aims at carbon neutrality. 
 
(3) Direction of policies and measures for the future vision 
 
a. Measures to realize carbon neutrality in relation to CO  emissions 
2
 
In  the  industrial  sector,  production  equipment  used  in  manufacturing  is 
expensive,  and  energy-efficient  equipment  and  technologies  are  even  more 
expensive than existing technologies. In addition, since the lifetime of equipment 
is generally 30-40 years, it is necessary to consider the timing of replacement of 
equipment with a view to realizing net-zero by 2050. Further investment burden 
is inevitable so that Japanese companies, which have a high level of energy-
efficiency technology in the world, will make energy consumption more efficient 
for realizing net-zero by 2050. Furthermore, promotion of energy conversions 
such  as  electrification  and  gas  conversions  will  require  installing  not  only 
production  equipment  itself,  but  also  infrastructure  facilities  such  as  power 
receiving equipment and piping. 
In order to accurately grasp the current situation of these businesses and 
overcome their challenges, it is essential to exploit potential of energy efficiency 
through  technological  development  and  to  improve  economic  efficiency  by 
                                                   
17 An international initiative that aims to achieve business operations with the 100% usage 
of electricity of renewable energy origin. 
- 30 - 
  
spreading  energy-efficient  equipment  and  facilities.  It  is  necessary  for  the 
Government to take policy measures that combine regulatory and supporting 
measures. Especially, fine support to small and medium-sized enterprises is 
required  including  provision  of  energy  efficiency  diagnosis  and  related 
information. 
 
-  Electrification and energy conversion for promoting decarbonization of heat 
demand and manufacturing processes 
 
Heat demand in the industrial sector broadly covers the range of temperature 
zones from low to high. For the heat demand in low-temperature such as steam 
and hot water, utilizing electrification technologies including heat pumps and 
electric heating wires would be a relevant option for decarbonization. However, 
there are challenges in the aspect of cost such as of equipment and electricity 
bills. 
Some of the heat demand in the high temperature zone can be decarbonized 
by electrification technologies such as electric furnaces using infrared heating 
methods,  etc.  However,  it  may  be  difficult  to  economically,  calorically,  and 
structurally deal with large-scale heat demand in the high temperature zone 
To decarbonize such heat demand, which is economically, calorically, and 
structurally difficult to be electrified, the option is to decarbonize the gas and other 
energy sources that supply heat energy.  
For example, synthetic methane and synthetic fuels, which can be regarded 
as carbon-neutral by combining hydrogen derived from renewable energies etc. 
and CO , can reduce investment costs for decarbonization because existing 
2
infrastructure and facilities can be utilized, and also contribute to stable supply of 
energy by securing a diversity of energy supply sources other than electricity. On 
the  other  hand,  since  synthetic  methane  and  synthetic  fuels  are  difficult  to 
increase  in  size  and  reduce  cost,  it  is  necessary  to  work  on  technological 
development and demonstration to overcome these challenges. 
For optimal energy conversion on the demand side, Japan will pursue various 
options such as the use of synthetic methane and synthetic fuels that can utilize 
existing infrastructure and facilities. 
While  there  are  various  challenges  to  promote  decarbonization  in  the 
industrial sector, hydrogen is expected to be an energy source that enables to 
promote  decarbonization  in  this  sector  by  contributing  not  only  to  the 
decarbonization of heat demand through the use of hydrogen boilers, but also to 
the  decarbonization  of  the  manufacturing  process  itself  such  as  hydrogen-
reduced iron making. On the other hand, such challenges still exist as there are 
many fields which require further innovation because technologies have yet to be 
established and it is needed to have large quantities of hydrogen supply at low 
- 31 - 
  
cost from the perspective of international competitiveness, etc. Therefore, Japan 
will address from now on the development and demonstration of application 
technologies, and the expansion of supply network that will lead to the reduction 
in supply costs, and the development of large transport vessels etc. 
  
b. Measures to achieve carbon neutrality in the field of HFCs 
 
In Japan, the emission of HFCs, high potent greenhouse gasses, has been 
continuously increasing. Thus, controlling HFCs emission is a pressing challenge. 
To achieve net-zero by 2050, the Government will take actions to reverse the 
trend of increasing HFCs emissions in a shorter-term and reduce fluorocarbons 
gradually and steadily. Also, the Government aims to eventually complete the 
transition  from  fluorocarbons  in  the  longer-term.  Since  the  smooth 
implementation of the measures requires public awareness, the Government will 
promote initiatives to raise such awareness. 
Regarding the PFCs, SF6, and NF3 emissions, because of the industrial 
sector’s voluntary action plans, very high level of emissions control has been 
already achieved. The Government will facilitate the industry to maintain such 
high level of emissions control. 
In this regard, the Government will firmly implement the following measures 
as pillar actions: 
 
(a) Steady implementation of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol 
 
Based on the international framework of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal 
Protocol with its domestic legislation, the Act on the Protection of the Ozone Layer 
through the Control of Specified Substances and Other Measures (Act No. 53 of 
1988), the Government will continue to phase down production and consumption 
of HFCs by 85% compared to the reference value (the average value in 2011-
2013 plus 15% of the reference value of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)) by 
2036. The Government will, then, reduce the consumption of HFCs further toward 
2050, coupled with measures to diffuse RAC (refrigeration and air conditioning) 
equipment using green refrigerants. 
 
(b) Promotion of RAC equipment using green refrigerants 
 
Given the compliance with the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol and 
taking account of lifespans of RAC equipment, early actions should be taken to 
widely  promote  RAC  equipment  using  green  refrigerants 18 ,  including  by 
                                                   
18 Alternative gases such as non-fluorocarbons and substances with low global warming 
potential (GWP) 
- 32 - 
  
mainstreaming of natural refrigerants. The Government promotes such facilitating 
measures  both  supply  and  demand  sides.  Specifically,  actively  utilizing  the 
designated products framework, specified in the Act on Rational Use and Proper 
Management of Fluorocarbons (Act No. 64 of 2001), the Government aims to 
mainstream RAC equipment using green refrigerants, which is already available 
in the market, by expanding the list of designated products and reviewing the 
target values. 
Regarding flammable and mildly flammable refrigerants, which currently face 
some challenges for market use, the Government will facilitate the development 
and promotion of RAC equipment using such refrigerants in consideration of their 
properties.  The  Government  will  also  support  the  development  of  ultra-low 
GWP19  refrigerants,  which  will  potentially  lead  the  global  market  of  RAC 
equipment using green refrigerants. 
 
(c) Leakage prevention of fluorocarbons in RAC equipment usage 
 
During the transitional period from RAC equipment using fluorocarbons to 
low-GWP and non-fluorocarbon refrigerants, a certain amount of RAC equipment 
using fluorocarbons is expected to remain for use. Thus, to prevent leakage of 
the refrigerants in the usage of equipment, the Government continues to utilize 
technical and institutional measures such as the thorough implementation of 
regular inspection of equipment mandated by the Act on Rational Use and Proper 
Management of Fluorocarbons, dissemination of IoT technologies, improvement 
in  detecting  the  level  of  the  leakage,  and  integrated  management  of 
equipment/refrigerants and user information. 
 
(d) Recovery and proper management of fluorocarbons from RAC equipment 
 
The Government strives to execute the Act on Rational Use and Proper 
Management of Fluorocarbons, which mandates related stakeholders such as 
equipment  users,  waste  and  recycling  entities,  and  fluorocarbons  recovery 
operators, to mutually coordinate and verify information on the refrigerants; in this 
way,  the  recovery  of  refrigerants  upon  equipment  disposal  is  appropriately 
conducted without fail. The Government also strives to thoroughly reduce the 
unrecovered refrigerants upon equipment disposal by maximizing recovery rate 
with improved recovery techniques and studying the possibility of integrated 
management of equipment/refrigerants and user information. 
For the possible interim shortage of refrigerant supply in the market due to the 
gradual reduction of HFCs consumption and production mandated by the Kigali 
                                                   
19 GWP (Global Warming Potential): The degree to which each greenhouse gas contributes 
to global warming, described as a ratio to the effect of carbon dioxideCO . 
2
- 33 - 
  
Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, the Government strives to establish a 
circular economy system that enables refrigerants to be recovered, recycled, and 
reused in a closed-loop, while pursuing zero refrigerant leakage from equipment 
during the use at the same time. 
 
(e) International cooperation on fluorocarbons reduction 
 
The global demand for refrigerants in the RAC sector is expected to increase 
continuously, and relevant Japan’s expertise on fluorocarbon management can 
benefit developing countries. Thus, the Government strives to contribute to global 
fluorocarbons reductions by promoting Japan-style lifecycle management system 
of fluorocarbons and RAC technologies.

c. Driving decarbonization in corporate management 
 
To  achieve  “decarbonized  manufacturing,”  it  is  important  not  only  for 
technologies such as those mentioned above to be introduced, but also initiatives 
for decarbonization to be taken by the industries. The Government will continue 
to support voluntary reduction targets and subsequent implementation by each 
industry. Furthermore, the Government and the industries will work together to 
identify  the  challenges  and  measures  to  quantify  contributions  to  reduction 
through the value chains and facilitate the understanding of the international 
community with awareness campaigns on the concepts and specific cases. The 
Government will also promote the setting of ambitious goals consistent with the 
long-term goals set out in the Paris Agreement and the formulation of business 
strategies that incorporate climate-related risks and opportunities, including in 
their supply chain among the business community, including small and medium-
sized  enterprises.  The  Government  will  thereby  increase  the  number  of 
- 34 - 
  
companies that incorporate decarbonization into corporate management and 
facilitate wide acceptance in the society. 
 
3. Transport 
(1) Current status 
 
Energy-related CO  emissions from Japan's transport sector were 206 million 
2
tons in FY2019, a reduction of 8.2% compared to FY2013. 
 
a. Construction of transportation, logistics, and infrastructure systems that are 
compatible with the electrification of automobiles 
 
Japanese domestic passenger transport volume decreased in 2011 primarily 
due to the Great East Japan Earthquake, but the falling trend ceased in FY2012 
and remained at that level since. Domestic freight transportation fell until FY2012, 
due to the Great East Japan Earthquake that occurred in 2011 and a shortage of 
truck  drivers  for  automobile  freight  transportation.  From  FY2012  onward, 
automobile freight transportation levelled off, and freight transportation volume 
remained at that level. As the population declines with declining birthrate and 
aging population, public transport networks, especially in rural areas, shrank. A 
labor shortage in the logistics also affects the amount of activities. 
The majority of CO  emissions in the transportation sector (approx. 86%) 
2
comes  from  automobiles,  accounting  for  approx.  16%  of  Japan's  total  CO  
2
emissions,  but new  sales  of  next-generation  vehicles20 ,  including  electrified 
vehicles21 ,  account  for  only  approx.  40%22  of  the  total  vehicle  sales,  so 
accelerating the shift from gasoline and diesel vehicles to electrified vehicles is 
essential to achieve carbon neutrality. 
                                                   
20 In addition to electrified vehicles, clean diesel vehicles, CNG vehicles, etc. are included. 
21 Electric vehicles (EVs), fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHVs), and 
hybrid vehicles (HVs). 
22 Of the 4.3 million new passenger cars sold in 2019, 1.69 million were next-generation 
vehicles. This includes 1.47 million hybrid vehicles (about 34%), 21,000 electric vehicles 
(about 0.5%), 18,000 plug-in hybrid vehicles (about 0.4%), 0.07 million fuel cell vehicles 
(about 0.02%), and 175,000 clean diesel vehicles (about 4.1%). 
- 35 - 
  
Figure 17 Breakdown of energy-related CO  emissions from transport sector 
2
(FY2019, Final Figures) (Source: Compiled based on Japan's GHG Inventory) 
 
From the perspective of transportation, logistics, and infrastructure systems it 
is necessary to strengthen climate measures that will lead to the simultaneous 
realization of CO emission reductions and the vitalization of mobility. This will be 
2 
in combination with utilizing and applying new technologies such as automated 
driving and digital technology to electrified vehicles, considering the diverse 
needs of local transportation for low-speed driving and new services such as 
downsizing (downsizing of vehicles, review of routes and frequencies, etc.). It is 
also required to promote the spread of EVs by devising multifaceted ways to use 
them, taking advantage of their functions as storage batteries and mobile power 
sources in times of disaster. 
 
b. Developing Sustainable Transportation and Logistics Services through Digital 
and Green 
 
CO  emissions from the transportation sector account for approx. 20% of 
2
Japan's total CO  emissions. In order to reduce these emissions, it is necessary 
2
not only to take measures against automobiles alone, but also to strengthen the 
combined measures of “Avoid” (reducing unnecessary traffic congestion, etc.), 
“Shift” (switching to modes of transportation with low carbon emission intensity, 
such as by promoting the use of public transportation and modal shift), and 
“Improve” (technological innovation such as digital technologies including AI, IoT, 
and big data, and creation of new services using new technologies). In order to 
smoothen road traffic flow, it is necessary to strengthen efforts in terms of both 
non-structural measures, such as the use of ICT technology and measures for 
toll  systems,  and  structural  measures  that  contribute  to  combating  traffic 
- 36 - 
  
congestion. 
In the field of public transportation, it is necessary to decarbonize, and further 
promote, the use of public transportation which provides essential services as a 
means of transportation to support life and economic activities in local regions, in 
light of the fact that the situation surrounding public transportation has become 
more severe due to the impact of the COVID-19 infection. In this context, the 
Government will promote incorporating the consideration of environmental load 
reduction into regional public transportation plans based on the revised Regional 
Public  Transportation  Revitalization  and  Reconstruction  Law  (enacted  in 
November 2020). In cooperation with urban development, it is necessary to 
promote the use of transportation systems with low CO  emissions, such as LRT 
2
(Light Rail Transit23), BRT (Bus Rail Transit24), EV and FCV. It is also necessary 
to  improve  the  convenience  of  public  transportation  services  by  socially 
implementing MaaS (Mobility as a Service25), utilizing big data, promoting the 
Compact Plus Network, and providing seamless transportation services through 
the improvement of transportation hub functions, thereby creating an enabling 
environment that encourages behavioral change for people to choose public 
transportation. At the same time, based on Bicycle Use Promotion Act (Law No. 
113 of 2016), which clearly states that the degree of dependence on automobiles 
in transportation should be reduced, it is necessary to promote the use of bicycles 
by increasing bicycle sharing for commuting purposes. 
In light of the fact that truck transportation accounts for approx. 80% of 
domestic freight transportation, and that CO  emissions from trucks (total of 
2
commercial  and  private  use)  account  for  approx.  7%  of  Japan's  total  CO  
2
emissions, it is a challenge to improve the efficiency in freight transportation and 
to shift to the mode of transportation with a lower CO emission intensity. 
2 
The shipping, aviation, and railway sectors account for approx. 5%, 5%, and 
4%, respectively, of CO  emissions in the transportation sector. To further reduce 
2
these emissions, it is necessary to accelerate the shift from fossil fuels to carbon-
free alternative fuels, and to promote the development and introduction of next-
generation green transportation systems that contribute to energy conservation 
and CO  reduction.

performance, etc. 
24 A bus rapid transit system that utilizes dedicated lanes, etc. 
25 A service that uses smartphone applications, etc., to search, book, and pay for the optimal 
combination of multiple public transportation and other transportation services in response 
to the transportation needs of local residents and travelers on an individual trip basis. 
- 37 - 
  
c. Achieving carbon neutrality in the port and maritime sectors 
 
Since many industries such as power generation, iron and steel, and chemical 
industries, accounting for about 60% of Japan's total CO  emissions, are located 
2
in ports and coastal areas, it is necessary to boost the decarbonization by 
creating a large demand for hydrogen and fuel ammonia26 for a variety of uses 
through cooperation among businesses, in parallel with expanding hydrogen 
supply and upgrading port functions in line with decarbonization. It is necessary 
to  improve  the  environment  to  facilitate  stable  and  inexpensive  imports  of 
hydrogen and fuel ammonia in large quantities at ports, via which 99.6% of import 
and export cargo passes, and to build an international supply chain to secure 
hydrogen and fuel ammonia.  
Toward net-zero by 2050, carbon neutrality in the entire supply chain is also 
required.  Shipping  accounts  for  approx.  40%  of  the  total  domestic  cargo 
transportation on a ton-kilometer basis. Shipping is also expected to play a major 
role in import and export including the import of decarbonized fuels such as 
hydrogen. In order for Japan to secure stable maritime transportation, carbon-
neutral maritime transportation including international shipping27 is required. 
 
(2) Future vision 
 
The Green Growth Strategy states as follows: “Comprehensive measures will 
be taken to achieve 100% electrified vehicles in new passenger car sales by 2035. 
For commercial vehicles, comprehensive measures such as promotion of vehicle 
introduction and infrastructure development will be taken with the aim that the 
electrified vehicles will account for 20–30% of new vehicle sales by 2030, and 
that electrified vehicles and vehicles suitable for use of decarbonized fuels such 
as synthetic fuels will together account for 100% of new vehicle sales by 2040 for 
light-duty  vehicles  of 8  tons  or  less. As for  large  vehicles  over  8  tons,  the 
Government aims to introduce 5,000 units of electrified vehicles in advance in the 
2020s, while promoting technological verification to develop and promote the use 
of electrified vehicles suitable for commercial use such as cargo and passenger 
business, and by 2030, based on the progress of efforts to develop and promote 
                                                   
26  Ammonia,  which  does  not  emit  CO when  burned,  is  expected  to  be  the  main 
2 
decarbonized fuel in the transition to a hydrogen-based society. An annual market of 1.7 
trillion yen will be expected in 2050. As a procurement supply chain that can be controlled 
by Japan, domestic demand for fuel ammonia is estimated to be about 30 million tons per 
year domestically, and the Government is aiming for an annual demand of 100 million tons 
worldwide. 
27 In the international maritime sector, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set 
the goals of reducing the total annual greenhouse gas emissions from international 
shipping at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008, and phasing out greenhouse gas 
emissions from international shipping as soon as possible in this century.

technologies to reduce the price of hydrogen and synthetic fuels, etc. In addition, 
based on the progress in the development and diffusion of technologies to reduce 
the price of hydrogen and synthetic fuels, etc., the Government will set a target 
for the diffusion of electrified vehicles in 2040.” In this context, in order to promote 
the spread of electrified vehicles, the Government will promote cost reduction and 
convenience improvement, including the use of fuel efficiency regulations and 
stable supply of inexpensive renewable energy, etc. 
In addition to measures for vehicles alone, it is important to organically link 
and integrate electrified vehicles with various social systems in local regions, in 
response to the electrification of vehicles and with a view to the transformation of 
the mobility society in 2050 as depicted in the Green Growth Strategy. 
In the field of logistics, in order to cope with the shortage of human resource 
and  to  achieve  both  efficiency  and  productivity  improvements  and 
decarbonization, the Government will build a new mobility service through green 
logistics  initiatives,  such  as  realization  of  more  efficient  and  energy-saving 
transportation in the entire supply chain,  promotion of logistics DX28 using AI, 
IoT, etc. with cooperation of related businesses, enhancement of efficient logistics 
networks  using  technology  like  automated  driving,  improvement  of  truck 
transportation efficiency including advanced logistics systems with cooperation 
among  related  businesses  using  digital  technology  from  the  perspective  of 
logistics MaaS29, and further promotion of modal shifts to shipping and rail. 
It is necessary to make the transportation and logistics system more resilient 
to climate change risks so that transportation and logistics services as essential 
services will not be disrupted for a long time in the event of a disaster. 
In the shipping sector, by promoting the development and implementation of 
low-carbon and decarbonizing technologies and leading the establishment of 
related international regulations, Japan will strategically strive for carbon-neutral 
maritime transportation. Japan aims to start a demonstration project of zero-
emission ships by 2025, realize the commercial operation of zero-emission ships 
before 2028, and further spread zero-emission ships towards 2030. In 2050, the 
fuel used for ships is expected to be converted into alternative fuels such as 
hydrogen and ammonia. 
   
                                                   
28  To transform the conventional way of logistics by improving existing operations and 
reforming work styles through mechanization and digitalization of the entire supply chain. 
29 A new mobility service in the field of logistics, in which truck vehicle data from multiple 
commercial vehicle manufacturers is linked through a common mechanism and utilized for 
issues that need to be addressed in a coordinated manner.

(3) Direction of measures and policies to realize the vision 
 
a. Promotion of transportation and logistics services using electrified vehicles 
 
In order to effectively reduce CO  emissions by utilizing technology-neutral 
2
fuel  efficiency  regulations  and  combining  all  kinds  of  technologies,  the 
Government will encourage automobile manufacturers, etc. to improve the fuel 
efficiency of new vehicles by meeting new fuel efficiency standards with a target 
year of FY2030. In addition, the Government will promote the spread of next-
generation vehicles such as buses, trucks, cabs for business use. 
By promoting the development and diffusion of next-generation heavy-duty 
vehicles through cooperation between industry, academia and government, the 
Government  aims  to  develop  electrification  technology  and  to  improve  the 
environmental performance of internal combustion engines, both of which are 
indispensable  for  further  reduction  of  CO   emissions,  thereby  putting  these 
2
technologies into practical use. Especially, in response to the growing need for 
decarbonization  of  logistics  services  among  shippers  and  consumers,  the 
Government will promote the use of electrified vehicles, such as the electrification 
of intra-regional transportation and delivery and the development and diffusion of 
fuel cell trucks for long-distance transportation. 
Based  on  the  trend  toward  the  reform  of  transportation  services  that 
contributes to the improvement of safety and convenience of transportation and 
the innovation of the use of travel time (effective use of travel time) by utilizing 
new technologies such as automated driving, the Government will promote the 
introduction of new transportation systems through automation such as the social 
implementation of automated driving technologies including the use of electrified 
vehicles. 
In  order  to  meet  the  needs  of  local  transportation  in  central  city  areas, 
residential  complexes  with  aging  populations,  hilly  and  mountainous  areas, 
remote islands, and sightseeing areas and so on, the Government will promote 
the introduction of new mobility services such as green slow mobility30, which 
utilizes electrified vehicles that run at speeds of less than 20 km/h, and ultra-
compact mobility31. The Government will also study how to coordinate the use of 
vehicles, roads, and existing transportation systems in an integrated manner so 
that the spread of low-speed driving can be promoted, seeking understanding 
and cooperation of local communities. 
 
                                                   
30 A small transportation service that utilizes electrified vehicles that can run on public roads 
at speeds of less than 20 km/h. 
31 A vehicle for one or two people that is more compact and maneuverable than a car, has 
excellent  environmental  performance,  and  can  be  used  as  a  convenient  means  of 
transportation in local communities.

b.  Promotion  of  social  implementation  of  urban  and  road  infrastructure  in 
response to the electrification of automobiles 
 
To promote the widespread use of EVs, the Government will promote setting 
up signs to guide people to recharging facilities on arterial roads in areas where 
there are few EV recharging facilities, conduct social experiments to install EV 
rechargers on public roads, and promote R&D support for the electric road 
system32, with aim of starting the experiments in the mid-2020s.

- 41 - 
  
supplies  electricity  from  EVs,  etc.  to  houses)  to  share  and  provide  energy 
between houses and vehicles, which will contribute to strengthening resilience 
functions. 
The  Government  will  strive  to  raise  awareness  about  the  functions  of 
electrified vehicles as a mobile power source in times of disaster. 
 
d.  Measures  for  road  traffic  flow  from  both  structural  and  non-structural 
perspectives 
 
The  Government  will  promote  initiatives  such  as  pinpointing  congestion 
bottlenecks based on scientific analysis of big data obtained by using ETC2.0, 
which enables bi-directional transmission and reception of large amounts of 
information and understanding of route information. 
The  Government  will  also  proceed  with  considering  the  introduction  of 
comprehensive traffic congestion countermeasures, including toll measures to 
adjust traffic demand using ICT and AI. 
Furthermore,  the  Government  will  build  a  road  transport  network  that 
increases productivity, such as by focusing on the construction of beltways in 
three  metropolitan  areas,  while  reducing  the  load  on  intra-city  roads  and 
reorganizing them into people-friendly road spaces. 
 
e. Promoting the use of public transportation and bicycles 
 
The Government will promote the use of public transportation by improving its 
convenience through the social implementation of MaaS, reorganizing regional 
transportation networks in conjunction with urban development, and promoting 
barrier-free transportation, while introducing LRT and BRT. In addition, in order to 
enhance  the  bicycle  use,  the  Government  will  promote  efforts  to  create  a 
facilitative environment for bicycle users. 
 
f. Promotion of green logistics 
 
The  Government  will  promote  transportation  efficiency  and  energy 
conservation throughout the supply chain by improving truck loading efficiency, 
optimizing  transportation  routes,  and  matching  supply  and  demand  through 
logistics DX, while improving the efficiency in truck logistics by establishing a joint 
transportation system and reducing courier redelivery. The Government will also 
promote the lowcarbonization of logistics facilities, the practical application of 
drone logistics, and the further promotion of modal shift. 
   
- 42 - 
  
g. Decarbonization of railways 
 
In the railway sector, as energy-efficient rolling stocks, such as lightweight 
rolling stock and rolling stock equipped with VVVF (Variable Voltage Variable 
Frequency control) equipment33 , as well as advanced energy-saving devices, 
have been introduced, these efforts will be further continued. The Government 
will also promote the development of fuel-cell railway vehicles that use hydrogen 
as their fuel. At the same time, the Government will improve the introduction of 
solar power generation that utilizes railway facilities. 
 
h. Decarbonization of the shipping sector 
 
The Government will formulate a roadmap for promoting greener coastal 
shipping by the end of 2021 to achieve carbon neutrality. Based on the roadmap, 
the Government will promote developing and spreading greener ships to improve 
ship operation in cooperation with all stakeholders concerned such as shippers, 
and “visualize” energy efficiency and CO  emission reduction performance of 
2
ships by the rating system for energy efficiency of coastal ships. At the same time, 
the Government will promote development, demonstration, and introduction of 
ships  that  contribute  to  the  modernization  of  coastal  shipping  and  the 
improvement of ship operation, utilizing innovative energy-saving technologies 
and digital technologies, including LNG-fueled ships34 and ships with hydrogen 
fuel systems or battery propulsion systems. 
In addition, with regard to the greener ships such as gas-fueled ships using 
hydrogen, ammonia and others, which are essential to achieving zero emissions, 
the  Government  will  promote  the  development  and  practical  use  of  core 
technologies  such  as  hydrogen/  ammonia  fueled-engines,  and  lead  the 
development  of  international  frameworks,  including  safety  standards  for 
hydrogen/ammonia-fueled ships to further accelerate energy saving efforts and 
decarbonization through the International Maritime Organization (IMO). 
The Government will also study carbon recycling technologies in the shipping 
                                                   
33  A vehicle equipped with a mechanism that efficiently controls the speed of the motor 
without using electrical resistance. 
34 LNG has a larger fuel volume per unit heating value than the heavy oil. It is in the gaseous 
state at ordinary temperatures because its boiling point is below zero, and its features are 
common to these carbon-neutral gases. It is vital to introduce hydrogen/ammonia-fueled 
ships by accumulating technical competence through introduction of LNG-fueled ships 
(fuel tanks, fuel supply systems, and gas-fueled engines). When the supply of clean 
methane from recycled CO  are realized in the future, LNG-fueled ships and the onshore 
2
fuel supply infrastructure can be diverted without modifications to those for carbon-recycled 
methane, which can contribute to achieving net-zero emissions. 
- 43 - 
  
sector, such as onboard CO  capturing35, maritime shipment of liquefied CO 36, 
2 2
and utilization of clean methane from recycled CO 37, in order to improve the 
2
environment for the social implementation of CCUS. 
 
i. Decarbonization of aviation 
 
In order to decarbonize the aviation sector, the following initiatives will be 
promoted: (1) introduction of new technologies into aircraft and equipment, (2) 
improvement of flight operation methods by upgrading air traffic control, (3) 
promotion of the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and (4) reduction 
of CO  emissions from airport facilities and vehicles. At the same time, the 
2
Government will study and initiate measures to turn airports into renewable 
energy hubs and promote public-private partnerships. In addition, Japan will lead 
the discussion  on  CO   emission  reduction  at  the  International  Civil Aviation 
2
Organization  (ICAO)  and  contribute  to  the  reduction  of  emissions  from 
international aviation. 
 
j. Strengthening transportation and logistics systems to cope with climate 
change risks 
 
The Government will strengthen the transportation infrastructure to ensure the 
functioning of transportation and logistics at the time of disaster, strengthen the 
initial  response  system  of  local  transportation  bureaus,  etc.,  and  enhance 
proactive measures such as transportation disaster prevention management to 
promote  the  improvement  of  disaster  response  capabilities  of  transportation 
businesses. 
The Government will appropriately promote the control of human flow and 
logistics during disasters by deepening the planned suspension of railways and 
promoting the prevention of airport isolation and so on, in order to suppress traffic 
during disasters from the perspective of saving lives, etc. 
 
k. Promotion of Carbon Neutral Port (CNP) initiative 
 
The  Government  will  promote  the  CNP  initiative  through  upgrading  port 
functions, taking account of decarbonization, such as stopping idling of ships by 
introducing onshore power supply to ships at anchor, introducing independent 
hydrogen power sources, promoting the use of hydrogen fuel for cargo handling 
                                                   
35 A technology for capturing CO  from the exhaust gas emitted from heat engines.

- 44 - 
  
machinery as well as large vehicles entering and leaving ports, and establishing 
digital logistics systems such as Cyber Port38 and AI terminals39 which support 
human workforces. 
With the aim of realizing CNP all over Japan by 2050, the Government will 
promote the CNP initiative based on the manual of CNP so that each port 
management body can formulate a plan for CNP with a target of CO  emission 
2
reduction as well as  a roadmap, and then, promote the demonstration and 
implementation of initiative, based on these plans. Through this initiative, the 
Government  will  create  ports  with  high  environmental  value  and  lead  the 
decarbonization of the world's ports. 
 
4. Community and living40 
 
(1) Current status 
 
Energy-related CO  emissions in the residential sector were 159 million tons 
2
in  FY2019,  a  drop  of  23.3%  compared  with  FY2013.  Energy-related  CO  
2
emissions in the commercial and other sectors were 193 million tons in FY2019, 
a drop of 18.8% compared with FY2013. Methane emissions were 28.4 million 
tons-CO eq. in FY2019, a drop of 5.4% compared with FY2013. Nitrous oxide 
2 
emissions were 19.8 million tons-CO eq. in FY2019, a drop of 7.5% compared 
2 
with FY2013. The Government has thus far convened nationwide campaigns, 
encouraged the improvement of energy efficiency of housing and buildings and 
accelerated introduction of facilities and devices of high energy efficiency. 
                                                   
38 A data platform that digitizes port logistics procedures among private businesses (port 
logistics field), procedures of the port management bodies (port administration field), and 
port infrastructure information from planning to maintenance and management (port 
infrastructure field), and handles them in an integrated manner through data coordination 
(the first operation in the port logistics field started on April 1, 2021). 
39 A container terminal that utilizes AI and other technologies to achieve a favorable 
working environment and the world's highest level of productivity. 
40  “Community and living” refers to the residential sector, commercial and other sectors, 
agriculture, forestry and fisheries, the construction industry and the related energy conversion 
sector and urban planning sector. It also deals with methane and nitrous oxide emissions, 
from agriculture and waste.

(FY2019, final figures) (Source: Compiled based on Japan's GHG Inventory) 
 
Improvement of energy efficiency and renewable energy in a local community 
can contribute to the development in the local economy. Japan relies on imports 
for most of its fossil fuels, which account for about 85% of its primary energy 
supply in FY2019. According to trade statistics from the Ministry of Finance, 
Japan's imports of mineral fuels amounted to about 11 trillion yen in the year 2020. 
Energy conservation measures and the introduction of renewable energy at the 
local level could lead to a decrease in the import value of these mineral fuels. 
Japan has been expanding the introduction of renewable energy while making 
wise use of its limited land area. As a result, Japan has one of the highest installed 
capacities of solar power per area in major countries. On the other hand, the 
current situation surrounding renewable energy is riddled with issues such as 
- 46 - 
  
cost, securing suitable land, and coexistence with the environment. Therefore, in 
order to maximize the potential of the abundant renewable energies in each local 
context and to make renewable energies the major power source, it is important 
that the entire country works together to overcome these issues and to expand 
the introduction of renewable energies in a sustainable manner that is beneficial 
to each local community. 
Japan now faces an inevitable decline in the population in the coming decades 
as the birthrate declines and population ages. In addition to this, the population, 
especially the youth, continues to move from rural areas to cities, and accelerates 
a  geographical  imbalance  in  the  population.  The  young  population  and  the 
working-age population are decreasing in regions, including rural areas. 
There are also challenges such as urban sprawl, increased vacant houses 
and abandoned farmland, maintenance and management cost of social capital, 
growing automobile dependence, and the impact on households from soaring 
energy prices. 
While each community faces numerous challenges, they all have diverse 
resources. Local resources include the locality's energy, natural resources, urban 
infrastructure and industrial clusters. Furthermore, there are also numerous other 
resources, such as the culture, climate, organizations and communities, and 
biodiversity.  The  progress  of  the  digital  revolution  may  well  contribute  to 
overcoming geographical constraints and moving towards a decentralized society. 
It can also contribute to regional revitalization by forging connections between 
localities and metropolitan hubs. 
For  problem  solutions  and  improved  sustainability  into  the  future,  it  is 
important  that  the  services  and  technologies  required  by  each  locality  are 
provided and widely shared through innovation, which in turn will lead to the 
development of the entire nation. 
Local communities endowed with diverse resources alongside economic and 
social challenges are actually suited to become a model of a decarbonized 
society: a bright society with a hope for the future. 
 
(2) Future vision 
 
In course of bringing about a shift in the social system towards a decarbonized 
society, a change in the minds toward harmony with nature and sustainable use 
of local resources is important at the individual, residential and regional levels. 
This should be done based on natural and societal ideals that take inspiration 
from the historical, cultural, geographical and economic characteristics of Japan, 
or, in other words, based on the concept of "coexistence." 
Additionally, a growth strategy that enhances community power is important. 
As  the  population  decline  with  decreasing  birthrate  and  aging  society,  it  is 
- 47 - 
  
important that the regional economic cycle is enhanced to lead to the regional 
revitalization so that those who wish may develop and sustain their communities. 
It is also necessary to look at the issue from the other end, to take measures to 
respond to climate change in line with the will of the people to develop and sustain 
their  communities  notwithstanding  the  constraints  of  depopulation,  thereby 
achieving the change in the minds. In addition, it is important to uplift socio-
economic activities by creating business in the local community. Furthermore, it 
is important for the cities and rural areas to form a broader network for symbiosis 
and exchanges, complementing and supporting each other with their resources, 
not just in its own community. 
Therefore, the Government aims at creating the “Circular and Ecological 
Economy,”  where  each  regional  community  utilizes  regional  resources  in  a 
sustainable manner and formulates a self-reliant and decentralized society while 
building  broader  networks,  in  order  to  advance  local  decarbonization,  and 
achieve the SDGs with integrated improvements on the environment, economy 
and society, thereby achieving a net-zero, resilient and comfortable community 
and living by 2050. 
Especially in rural areas, under local leadership, full advantage will be taken 
of  abundant  and  diverse  resources:  renewable  energy  including  biomass, 
photovoltaic solar panels built above the farmland (Farming-photovoltaics), and 
hydrogen. Furthermore, by supplying those energy sources to outside the rural 
areas will contribute to significant reduction of GHG emissions on a wider scale 
in Japan. 
Furthermore, based on the "Strategy for Sustainable Food Systems, MeaDRI 
(Measures for achievement of Decarbonization and Resilience with Innovation) " 
(decided by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on May 12, 2021), 
which was formulated to promote the construction of sustainable food systems 
looking ahead to the future of local regions and to enhance productivity potentials 
and to ensure sustainability of agriculture, forestry, fisheries and food industries 
in a compatible manner through innovation, the Government will promote the 
implementation of technologies that have already been developed in the entire 
supply  chain,  from  sourcing,  production,  processing  and  distribution,  to 
consumption,  sequentially  develop  innovative  technologies  and  production 
systems by 2040, and promptly implement them in society by 2050. 
The  Government  also  aims  to  expand    the  practices  of  simultaneous 
achievement of decarbonization and regional revitalization throughout Japan and 
overseas (decarbonization domino effect), and to realize a strong and vibrant 
decarbonized society in many local regions by solving regional issues without 
waiting until 2050. 
 
- 48 - 
  
 
Figure 22  Image of decarboniszation domino effect 
 
 
Following are the concrete images and goals toward decarbonization in local 
regions. Japan aims to ensure that: 
 
  A business model will have been established and thereby, autonomously 
diffused, that facilitates the installment of solar power generation with no initial 
investment, including with the introduction of energy storage equipment, such 
as storage batteries, that adjusts supply and demand from the demand side. 
  The era of “purchasing electricity” will have been transformed into the era of 
“generating electricity” in households by 2050, thereby, making decarbonized 
energy “prosumers” common in the society. 
  The fact will have been common that renewable energy businesses and 
projects,  which  confer  a  leading  role  to,  coexist  with,  and  benefit  local 
communities, have been diffused into every corner of Japan, thereby taking a 
leadership in contributing to the decarbonization in the local regions. 
  All kind of actors including national and local governments, producers, and 
builders/developers will have shared a common understanding that houses 
with high heat insulation performance would improve residents’ comfort and 
health, while simultaneously reducing CO emissions, and made efforts to 
2 
implement it as a taken-for-granted fact. 
  EVs/plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)/FCVs will have been the first 
option of vehicle both for human transportation and logistics within the local 
regions. 
  Infrastructure  will  have  been  set  in  place  that  enables  the  safe  use  of  
EVs/PHEVs/FCVs  anywhere  in  the  country;  and  most  of  the  electricity 
provided in battery charging infrastructure, and most of the hydrogen provided 
in hydrogen stations, will have been renewable energy originated. 
  The electricity storage function equipped to the introduced EVs/PHEVs will 
have been utilized as social infrastructure to maximize the use of renewable 
- 49 - 
  
energy generated in the local regions. 
  Commercial vehicles, such as trucks and buses, as well as motorcycles, will 
have been shifted to EVs and FCVs; and a business model will have been 
created that contributes to functioning the supply and demand adjustment of 
local renewable energy, improving resilience of the local communities, and 
forming local circular economy on the basis of utilizing battery-replaceable 
EVs as energy stations,. 
  In collaboration with citizens and businesses, the use of environmentally 
friendly  design  products  (resource  saving,  reusable,  easy  to  separate, 
material replacement by recycled materials or bio-based plastics, etc.) will 
have been in progress in an integrated manner with the reduction of one-way 
plastics,  as  well  as  the  collection  and  recycling  of  plastic  resources  by 
municipalities, manufacturers/distributors, and dischargers. 
  “Reuse”  of  used products  will  have  become  common;  and  solar  panels, 
battery storages, etc., will have been reused when they can be reused, or 
recovered and adequately disposed by recycling when they cannot be reused. 
  The electricity, heat, CO , biogases, etc. derived from waste treatment and 
2
sewerage systems will have been widely utilized in the local regions. 
  Driving efficiency will have been improved by utilizing IoT technology in waste 
treatment facilities; and waste collection and transportation vehicles will have 
been further electrified. 
  Cities will have become more compact, and spacious and bustling walkable 
spaces will have been created all over the country, thereby vehicle-centered 
spaces shifting to human-centered spaces, and comprehensive efforts toward 
decarbonization kept in progress. 
  By 2050 agriculture, forestry and fisheries industries will have achieved net-
zero  CO   emissions;  and  horticultural  facilities  will  have  completed  their 
2
transition to facilities that uses no fossil fuels. 
  The technologies will have been established by 2040, that are associated to 
the electrification and hydrogenation of agricultural and forestry machinery 
and fishing vessels. 
  The used amount of chemical fertilizers manufactured from imported raw 
materials and fossil fuels will have been reduced by 30% by 2050. 
 
(3) Policy orientation for the future vision 
 
a. Realizing “Decarbonization Domino Effect” 
 
The commitment to 2050 decarbonization (Zero Carbon City Declaration), in 
which only four local governments participated as of October 2019, now engages 
over 110 million people on a population scale. In order to put this commitment 
- 50 - 
  
into  practice  in  the  future,  it  will  be  necessary  for  the  national  and  local 
governments, businesses, financial institutions, and the general public to work 
together  to  clarify  by  2030  the  images  of  each  local  regions  toward 
decarbonization, while mobilizing measures and policies to spread to other local 
regions through a "decarbonization domino effect” for implementation. 
Japan  held  the  “Council  for  National  and  Local  Decarbonization"  with 
representatives from the national and local governments and formulated the 
"Regional Decarbonization Roadmap" with the aim to realize a decarbonized 
society  by  2050  in  the  local  regions  through  collaboration  and  co-creation 
between the national and local governments, especially in the areas of "life" and 
"society" that are closely related to regional efforts. 
Based on this, the Government will mobilize policies to intensively promote 
initiatives  using  the  latest  applicable  technologies  in  the  next  five  years.  In 
addition, local governments, local businesses, and financial institutions will play 
a central role in promoting the development of decarbonization leading areas with 
the active support of the national government. At least 100 decarbonization 
leading areas will establish by FY2025 their roadmaps for decarbonization and 
start  implementing  it  by  FY2030,  showing  the  simultaneous  realization  of 
decarbonization and regional revitalization in diverse areas such as rural areas, 
remote islands, and urban districts. Then, the Government will disseminate the 
simultaneous  achievement  of  decarbonization  and  regional  revitalization 
throughout  Japan  and  overseas  (decarbonization  domino  effect),  aiming  to 
realize a strong and vibrant decarbonized society with solutions to local issues in 
many regions even before 2050.

(a) Initiatives for housing and buildings 
 
Initiatives for housing and buildings are necessary in order to shift to carbon 
neutral life. 
The facilities and equipment that have achieved energy efficiency, together 
with existing technologies, will be used as widely as possible by accelerating 
social implementation of high-performance next generation power semiconductor. 
New  energy  efficient  products  with  the  AI,  IoT,  big  data  technology  and 
coordination between devices will also be promoted for wider usage. As the 
average lifespan of home appliances is approximately 10 years, the market for 
these goods needs to be formed by 2040 at the latest, for use by 2050. In the 
meantime, to limit the increases in energy consumption by using the ICT, the 
communications  systems  which  contribute  to  the  decarbonization  will  be 
promoted. 
The Government will aim to ensure that an average stock level of energy-
saving performance is equivalent to the level of Net Zero Energy House (ZEH)41 
and Net Zero Energy Building (ZEB)42 in 205043, and to make the introduction of 
renewable  energy  such  as  photovoltaic  power  generation  equipment  more 
common in houses and buildings. 
It  is  important  to  promote  the  integrated  use  of  demand  and  supply  in 
photovoltaics in housing and buildings. As the operating time of solar power 
generation is limited, the Government aims to achieve the sector coupling of 
electricity, heat, and mobility in general, using electrified vehicles, heat pump-type 
water heaters fuel cells and cogeneration, and according to local characteristics, 
as well as the Home and Building Energy Management Systems (HEMS, BEMS) 
and  the  ICT for the supply  and demand adjustment of  photovoltaics  power 
generation.  In  addition,  electrified  vehicle  charging  stations  will  be  set  up 
considering the synchronism between the operating time of the photovoltaics 
                                                   
41 ZEH (Net Zero Energy House): Houses that save 20% or more energy and further reduce 
energy consumption by introducing renewable energy, etc. are defined as (1) "ZEH" (100% 
or more reduction), (2) Nearly ZEH (75% to less than 100% reduction), or (3) ZEH Oriented 
(no introduction of renewable energy), depending on the amount of reduction. 
42 ZEB (Net Zero Energy Building): Buildings that save 50% or more energy and further 
reduce energy consumption by introducing renewable energy, etc. are defined as (1) "ZEB" 
(100% or more reduction), (2) Nearly ZEB (75% to less than 100% reduction), or (3) ZEB 
Ready (no introduction of renewable energy), depending on the amount of reduction. ZEB 
Ready (no introduction of renewable energy). (4) ZEB Oriented is defined as buildings with 
10,000 m² or more that use technologies that are not currently evaluated in the energy 
conservation  calculation  program  based  on  the Act  on  the  Improvement  of  Energy 
Consumption Performance of Buildings (Act 53 of 2015), although they are expected to 
achieve energy savings of 10,000 m² or more. 
43 ”An average stock level of energy-saving performance equivalent to the ZEH and ZEB 
standards” means to reduce primary energy consumption by 20% for houses from energy 
saving standard and by 30% or 40% for buildings in an average stock level. 
- 52 - 
  
power generation and the parking time. With such measures in housing and 
buildings, a balance between supply and demand across the entire power system 
will be sought. 
The Government also facilitates the use of underground44 and biomass heat, 
not easily affected by outside temperatures, to houses and buildings according 
to local characteristics with proposed utilization models as well as improvement 
of heat energy efficiency such as heat pump. In addition to the decarbonization 
of power supply, electrification and hydrogenation are effective in improving 
energy use efficiency in living. 
For new housing and buildings, the Government will avail ZEH/ZEB and the 
housing that contribute to a negative net emission in its entire lifecycle, from 
material production and construction, to dismantling and reuse for wider usage. 
For existing houses and buildings, the Government will facilitate refurbishments 
to improve energy efficiency. The Government will further facilitate innovative 
technological development and wider usage of building materials and equipment 
necessary to achieve the future vision of houses and buildings in 2050. 
In  addition,  to  expand  the  use  of  wood  as  a  source  of  absorption,  the 
Government will promote using wood for design and construction of buildings.

from  an  underground  layer  of  water  (aquifer)  and  cool/heat  the  building  efficiently. 
Demonstration experiment of this system was conducted in Osaka City, a designated area 
under the Act on the Regulation of Extraction of Groundwater for Use in Buildings. As it 
has been confirmed that land subsidence and other side effects do not occur, the 
demonstration experiments have been permitted under the Act on August 2019.

(b) Lifestyle shift 
 
The behaviors and choices of each individual are also important in making a 
shift to carbon-neutral living. By taking climate change as one’s own problem and 
changing his/her daily living, local residents can be involved in a social change, 
creating a great force for change. In making living as a consumer and/or a 
producer, it is important to be involved in decarbonizing the society through the 
choice of products and services as well as the lifestyle. 
There is a rapid increase in “servicizing,” such as leasing and renting of 
products and the ESCO (Energy Service Company), focusing on the function of 
a product and providing that function of the product as a service, rather than 
selling the ownership of the product, making use of the IoT and AI. The sharing 
economy (e.g., car sharing, cycle sharing, private lodging services and shared 
houses), which is one form of such a service is also rapidly increasing. The 
Government will pursue the possibilities of lifestyle shifts through “servicizing,” 
especially  by  “visualizing”  the  emission  reduction  effects  and  taking 
decarbonization initiative based on the findings therein. 
For a consumer, preference for local consumption of local products can lead 
to reducing CO  emissions from logistics and to the opportunities for promotion 
2
of local industries. Bearing this point and the circumstances in each locality in 
mind, the Government will pursue the possibility of decarbonization through local 
consumption of local products, in view of the entire lifecycle of products, starting 
with the securing of resources, and including production, distribution, using, 
reusing, recycling and disposal. 
For a producer, the introduction of the telework and flextime system by making 
use of the ICT can reduce CO emissions from commuting traffic. Additionally, 
2 
shared office space, together with reduced use of air conditioners and space, can 
further contribute to improvement of energy efficiency in the office. While reducing 
CO  emissions, the environment and productivity will be improved to make it 
2
easier for people to balance work with childcare/nursing care. The Government 
will support a reform in the working habits by “visualizing,” demonstrating the 
effects of reducing CO emissions. Expanding the use of remote access services 
2 
such  as  virtual  reality  may  also  contribute  to  reducing  CO   emissions from 
2
commuting and business trips. The Government will pursue the possibilities of 
decarbonizing through such approaches. 
In order to make it easier to transport without private vehicles the shift to public 
transportation of low CO emissions, such as railways and buses, and further use 
2 
of  bicycles  will  be  promoted  through  initiatives  such  as  commuting  traffic 
management by the operators and public awareness activities. Additionally, the 
Government  aims  to  reduce  CO   emissions  in  logistics  and  distribution  by 
2
reducing redelivery with cooperation among shippers and logistics and deliver 
- 54 - 
  
companies, diversification and improved convenience in delivery methods for 
courier  services,  and  improving  the  environment  for  active  participation  of 
consumers. 
The Government will also shed light on corporate activities as a consumer, 
such as the use of renewable energy, and promote the introduction of renewable 
energy and energy efficiency initiatives. 
For these lifestyle shifts, the Government will carry out a nationwide campaign 
to encourage “COOL CHOICE”, such as the use of goods and services that 
contribute to decarbonization, while putting together the scientific knowledge 
(citizen science) through public involvement. The Government will also promote 
the use of environmental information for decarbonization by companies and 
individuals, such as the diffusion of methods for understanding GHG emissions 
throughout the entire supply chain, which includes local small and medium-sized 
enterprises, for the environment-conscious products and business activities to be 
highly  valued  by  society  and  the  market.  Environmental  education  will  be 
promoted to foster values and stimulate behavioral change for each one of us in 
the society. Furthermore, through behavioral science knowledge including nudge 
and its integration with advanced technologies such as the AI and IoT, the 
Government  will  encourage  decarbonizing  behavior  that  can  be  practiced 
voluntarily and in an enjoyable way. 
 
b. Shaping carbon-neutral communities 
 
(a) Cross-sectoral initiatives to create self-sustaining and decentralized societies 
in local communities 
 
It is important that farming, forestry and fishing communities as well as cities 
will shift to carbon-neutrality, by complementing and supporting each other; each 
community  is  encouraged  to  make  use  of  its  characteristics,  create  a  self-
sustaining  and  decentralized  society,  while  establishing  broader  network. 
Additionally, it is important that a community in which regional energy becomes a 
local  industry  with  renewable  energy  is  developed,  and  the  construction  of 
distributed grids is formed to support new forms of demands such as smart 
mobility. 
The distributed energy system will not only contribute to energy efficiency 
improvement and wider use of renewable energy, but also to local revitalization 
and to the formation of the Circular and Ecological Economy. The construction of 
a distributed energy system on the low-voltage side is also expected to have the 
potential to reduce the cost of high-voltage and extra-high-voltage transmission 
infrastructure. On the other hand, as this is also a part of entire energy system of 
- 55 - 
  
Japan, the Government will promote the following initiatives while considering the 
cost and stability of the system as a whole. 
In order to promote the introduction of renewable energies that coexist with 
local  communities  and  the  natural  environment,  local  governments,  local 
companies, residents, and other local entities will take the initiative in introducing 
renewable energies and promote an environment for consensus building among 
the locals. In addition, with the aim of maximizing the introduction of renewable 
energy in the local regions, efforts will be made to secure suitable sites for solar 
power generation in a way that allows for coexistence with the local community, 
and to further reduce costs. It will be quicker and smoother to introduce wind 
power  generation.  Geothermal  power  generation,  small  and  medium-sized 
hydropower  generation,  biomass,  and  renewable  heat  such  as  solar  heat, 
geothermal heat, snow and ice storage, hot spring heat, seawater heat, river heat, 
sewage heat, etc. will be promoted in combination with their multifaceted effects 
to reduce costs and spread the use of them. Furthermore, the Government will 
promote the creation of a business environment in which future reinvestment can 
take place. The Government will also work to improve the system to enable the 
deployment  of  facilities  that  contribute  to  the  local  production  for  local 
consumption of renewable energy by utilizing owner-unknown land. 
Moreover, in order to enable the use of self-sustained power sources, such 
as local renewable energy, even in the event of disasters, the Government will 
work  on  building  models  for  regional  energy  supply  grids  that  use  digital 
technology, storage batteries, fuel cells, cogeneration, etc. 
When introducing renewable energy into local regions, securing the flexibility is 
challenging. To this end, the local community is encouraged to come together to 
make the demands of local residents function as flexibility sources, combining 
distributed energy resources such as battery storages, renewable energy, and 
off-grid power generation. In this regard, the Government aims to smoothly 
expand the energy resource aggregation business, in which the “aggregator,” 
who make use of technologies like the demand response (DR) and virtual power 
plant (VPP), facilitates the customers in controlling and creating their demands of 
energy  at  the  request  of  the  retail  electric  power  companies  and  power 
transmission and distribution companies, who will pay fees for the adjusted 
demands. The Government will also look into the potential flexibility of heat 
storage type air-conditioning equipment, heat pump water heaters in facilities with 
large demand for hot water supply, cogeneration, refrigerated storage, water 
supply and sewerage systems and back-up generators in large buildings. In 
addition, the Government will encourage smooth renewable energy installation 
by matching the supply and demand of renewable energy by tracking the power 
and environmental value with block chain technology. 
- 56 - 
  
Recently, there are cases in which a facility with high demand for power 
consumption, such as a data center, relocates to the area with a large supply of 
renewable  energy.  The  Government  will  also  look  into  such  possibilities  of 
geographical shifts on the demand side. 
In order to move such initiatives forward, the Government and local authorities 
will cooperate towards establishing an exemplary energy system that serves for 
wider use of the distributed energy systems. The Government will improve the 
information and communications infrastructure and institution for "prosumers"—
those who do not only consume but also produce energy such as personal 
photovoltaics and local production of energy for local consumption by a local 
energy supplier. The Government will also encourage the formation of business 
entities that promote regional self-sustaining diffusion of decarbonization, thereby 
accelerating  the  development  of  the  Circular  and  Ecological  Economy. 
Furthermore, the Government will utilize emissions information platforms and 
make  efforts  for  “visualization”  to  facilitate  the  smooth  implementation  of 
community and enterprise initiatives. 
In addition, the Government will support local activities that aim to create and 
spread innovations for a decarbonized society by engaging in dialogues with 
various  relevant  parties,  including  a  consultative  meeting.  Local  authorities, 
taking  their  own  initiatives  and  setting  examples  for  the  local  entities  and 
population, will play a central role in establishing the Circular and Ecological 
Economy by cooperating and working together with various stakeholders in and 
out of the locality. 
 
(b) Carbon-neutral development in urban areas 
 
As the population declines, birthrate decreases and the society ages, and the 
infrastructure ages in urban areas, it is increasingly important to review urban 
development, including infrastructures such as transportation, in order to cope 
with these challenges. It is important that these issues are dealt with a view to 
decarbonization. The Government will address comprehensively to transform the 
urban structure, such as ways of living and land usage considering mitigation and 
adaptation measures, with public-private partnership. 
The Government will promote compact cities, the creation of spaces that are 
"Comfortable  and  Walkable"  by  combining  with  the  Improving  Pedestrian 
Convenience Road System (Hokomichi) and comfort improvement zones, and 
the measures and projects based on the Comprehensive Urban and Regional 
Transportation  Strategy.  Furthermore,  the  Government  will  comprehensively 
promote the area decarbonization in cities through facilitating area-wide energy 
networks, developing and preserving parks and green spaces as carbon sinks, 
using digital technology, and mobilizing private finance by supporting private 
- 57 - 
  
urban development that are environmentally friendly to revitalize urban areas, 
and enhancing the social implementation of smart cities. The Government will 
also promote the introduction of renewable energy in urban parks. Furthermore, 
by implementing heat island countermeasures to improve thermal environment, 
the Government will promote the reduction of urban CO emissions. 
2

(Source: Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism) 
 
In conjunction with efforts to make cities more compact and to promote the 
use of public transportation, the Government will promote the development of 
spaces and environments that are safe, comfortable, and attractive for people to 
travel on foot or by bicycle, thereby increasing the percentage of travel by foot or 
bicycle and reducing CO  emissions from travel. In addition, in order to promote 
2
bicycle use, the Government will promote activities to support the formulation of 
the Bicycle Use Promotion Plans by local governments, the development of 
bicycle traffic space networks, the improvement of bicycle parking lots, and the 
use of bicycle sharing in coordination with safety measures, thereby contributing 
to the reduction of CO  emissions.

- 58 - 
  
 
Figure 26 The Image of compact city 
(Source: Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism) 
 
In terms of the existing infrastructures such as public facilities regarding water 
supply, sewerage systems, and waste disposal facilities, and transportation and 
energy infrastructures, the Government will promote energy conservation and 
make the infrastructures play the role of local energy centers to contribute to 
reducing CO  emissions, in combination with ￼ systems, expanding the area of 
2
their services while consolidating them, extending their service life, and improving 
their disaster prevention functions. In the field of construction works, in the short 
term, the goal is to reduce CO  emissions by promoting the use of construction 
2
machinery with superior fuel efficiency, while in the long term, a certification 
system for innovative construction equipment (electric, hydrogen, biomass, etc.) 
will be established to promote the introduction and diffusion of such equipment, 
which will radically shift from the use of light oil as a fuel source, in order to 
achieve carbon neutrality. In addition, by promoting i-Construction and other 
measures, such as the wide use of ICT construction by small and medium-sized 
construction  companies,  that  are  contractors  of  local  governments  for 
constructing  works,  the  Government  will  further  improve  the  efficiency  of 
construction and maintenance management and save workforce and labor to 
cope with the decrease in the number of skilled workers. Furthermore, in the field 
of infrastructure, which is used for a long period of time once it is built, efforts 
should be made not only to conserve energy in infrastructure services at the stage 
of service and management, but also to monitor the status of CO  emissions in 
2
- 59 - 
  
the  entire  lifecycle  of  the  infrastructures,  and  to  strengthen  efforts  toward 
decarbonization, including the use of materials that contribute to CO  reduction 
2
at each stage of the lifecycle from planning and design to construction and 
renewal to demolition. 
Alignment  with  the  land  use  policy,  urban  policy,  and  the  regional 
development policy are indispensable in achieving flexible exchange of electricity 
and heat amongst numerous facilities and buildings, more compact urban areas 
and the use of local biomass in sewerage systems. The Government will align 
these related policies and climate change measures. 
 
(c) Developing carbon-neutral rural areas 
 
Rural areas play an important role in supplying resources to sustain Japanese 
economy and society, including food and healthy natural environment. With this 
in  mind,  it  is  important  for  these  regions  to  be  revitalized  and  overcome 
challenges associated with declining populations and birthrate and aging, so that 
they can contribute to the decarbonization of the society through local production 
for local consumption of renewable energy and biomass resources, such as the 
utilization of locally distributed wood for housing, as well as supplying such 
resources outside these villages. 
The Government will promote the introduction of local energy companies and 
the  development  of  the  energy  system  suited  to  local  production  for  local 
consumption, in order to make the best use of the abundant renewable energy 
sources rural areas offer, which in turn will lead to the vitality and sustainable 
development of the areas. This will include the introduction of the Village Energy 
Management  System  (VEMS).  In  terms  of  “Farming-photovoltaics,”  the 
Government  will  take  initiatives  while  working  towards  making  good  use  of 
farmlands by appropriately continuing farming on the one hand, and activating 
community by supporting the reusing of the abandoned farmlands as well as 
settlement and farming in disadvantageous area on the other. 
- 60 - 
  
 
Figure 27 Farming-photovoltaics  
(Source: Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries) 
 
In the agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sectors, the Government will promote 
the adoption of energy-saving equipment, the conversion of energy used for 
heating horticultural greenhouses to woody biomass fuels and geothermal heat, 
and the use of livestock waste as energy sources. The Government also aims to 
reduce GHG emissions by realizing "smart agriculture, forestry and fisheries" 
through the use of ICT to improve work efficiency. The Government has set a 
target  to  establish  technologies  for  the  electrification  and  hydrogenation  of 
agricultural and forestry machinery and fishing vessels by 2040. Through these 
efforts, the Government aim to achieve net-zero CO  emissions in the agriculture, 
2
forestry and fisheries industries by 2050. 
Methane emissions will be reduced through improving and popularizing rice 
varieties  with  lower  methane  emission,  as  well  as  developing  and  diffusing 
production technologies such as of materials and water management.  
In addition, the Government will reduce emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) by 
reducing the use of nitrogen fertilizer and splitting fertilization in accordance with 
soil conditions or crop growth, that are monitored by drones, sensing technology, 
and AI; developing and popularizing materials; and constructing a crop rotation 
system that takes into account the maintenance of soil fertility.  
At the same time, the Government will promote the introduction of production 
systems that utilize AI, ICT, and other technologies to monitor and reduce GHG 
emissions. 
In  the  livestock  industry,  the  Government  will  develop,  disseminate,  and 
promote  technologies  to  reduce  GHG  emissions,  such  as  an  improved 
management system using feed that reduces GHG emissions and ICT, improved 
- 61 - 
  
livestock  manure  management  to  reduce  anaerobic  fermentation,  and 
improvement of genetic ability of livestock using genetic evaluation, so that Japan 
can make progress in reducing GHG emissions both on per-product as well as 
on the entire-industry bases. 
The use of sustainable biomass resources can play an important role in 
decarbonization, especially in the areas where decarbonization through the use 
of  CO -free  electricity  is  challenging.  The  Government  will  pursue  the 
2
establishment of a biomass resource supply chain. 
In carrying out these measures, the Government will promote decarbonization 
in  the  entire  supply  chain  through  production,  processing,  distribution, 
consumption and disposal (recycling) of agricultural, forestry and fishery products 
and food, as well as the visualization of measures related to the reduction of GHG 
emissions, such as certification and labeling. Moreover, the Government will 
promote organic agriculture to improve the natural cyclical function of agriculture 
and reduce the load on the environment, while raising the awareness of the 
consumers on organic agricultural products.

c. Resource circulation in regions 
 
In order to achieve significant reduction of GHG emissions in local regions, 
promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy alone will not be sufficient, 
and require to construct material-cycle society and to transit to circular economy. 
To realize these, it becomes more important to achieve an optimal scale of 
- 62 - 
  
resource recycling according to each region and type of resources. Ultimately, 
material flow needs to meet three preconditions: firstly, wood and other such 
renewable resources should be used at a pace that does not exceed that of the 
renewal of the nature; secondly, metal, fossil and other such non-renewable 
resources should be used at a pace that does exceed the pace of development 
of sustainable renewable resources to replace them to avoid depletion, and; 
thirdly, substances that may affect the natural circulation and the delicate balance 
of ecosystem in the nature should be emitted into the natural world at a pace that 
does not exceed the pace at which the nature renders them harmless45. Through 
past economic and industrial activities, the humanity has spent huge amounts of 
energy to produce metal, plastic and other products; these can be regarded as 
existing  resources. As  such,  recycling  in  all  fields  will  not  only  resolve  the 
constraints of the limited resources, but also contribute to the reduction of GHG 
emissions. Considering that the transition toward a circular economy has become 
the  mainstream  worldwide,  the  Government  will  promote  to  build  a  sound 
material-cycle  society  and  transition  toward  a  circular  economy  in  both  the 
technical and institutional term, and aim decarbonization with resource recycling 
measures. 
By optimizing production volumes and timing with the analysis of the weather 
and  consumption  using  the  AI,  and  by  optimizing  the  inspection,  repair, 
replacement and reusing of products using the IoT, goods and services can be 
provided to the person in need precisely when and as required, reducing the 
energy demand. The Government will pursue such possibilities, and make efforts 
for  the  best  use  of  the  “urban  mine46 ”  and  minimum  extraction  of  natural 
resources, contributing to decarbonization with such efforts. 
The  reduction  of  food  loss  and  waste  throughout  the  supply  chain,  can 
contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions in terms of less food distribution 
and  manufacturing,  as  well  as  from  less  transportation  and  processing  for 
disposal.  The  Government  will  facilitate  decarbonization  through  enlarging 
sustainable consumption, facilitating mutual understanding between consumer 
and producer, and promoting Japanese-style dietary habits with their excellent 
nutritional balance comprehensively. Additionally, the Government will promote 
the use of food loss and waste as feed to facilitate food recycling. The government 
will minimize the food loss and waste from enterprises by 2050 using demand 
forecast by AI and advancing technologies such as development of new package 
materials.

decision, June 19, 2018) 
46 Regarding a collection of used products containing useful metals as a mine. 
 
- 63 - 
  
The Government will promote circulation of plastics by reducing, reusing, 
thorough waste collection, energy recovery, proper treatment and the promotion 
of the use of recycled materials and renewable resources — paper, bio-based 
plastics, cellulose materials , etc. 
While promoting initiatives related to the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle), for 
waste which still remains, the Government will make every effort to promote 
efficient recovery of its energy, such as the heat utilization by waste power 
generation and the recovery of methane from raw waste. Additionally, waste 
treatment facilities will also aim to serve as a self-sustained distributed regional 
energy center, including in the event of disasters. Furthermore, the Government 
will promote the reduction of GHG emissions from the entire waste treatment 
system from collection and transportation to final disposal, by improving the 
sophistication and efficiency of technology, improving facilities, and reducing 
costs through demonstration projects for the separation, capturing, and utilization 
of CO  and other substances from the exhaust gases of incineration facilities, 
2
while facilitating the introduction of AI and IoT. 
To promote the recycling of resources in a wider area to recycle the waste 
which cannot be treated locally, the Government will designate “recycling ports”, 
which  will  be  a  base  for  reverse  logistics  and  recycling,  and  provide  a 
comprehensive support for such facilities such as: maintenance of port facilities; 
improvement in the operations for handling recyclable resources, and public-
private partnerships. The Government will also work towards the establishment 
of a reverse logistics network within and out of Japan, centered around such 
recycling ports. 
The Government will promote to introduce energy efficient and renewable 
energy technologies nationwide in sewerage systems. In particular, small and 
medium-sized sewerage systems will accept locally generated biomass, enabling 
efficient  energy  recovery  throughout  the  locality.  With  these  efforts,  the 
Government aims to halve the power consumption in sewerage systems within 
approximately 20 years. Advanced wastewater treatment is effective not only for 
improved local water quality and the recycling of water resources, but also for the 
reduction of nitrous oxide emissions. The Government will promote advanced 
treatment of local water according to the local environment. However, advanced 
water  treatment  increases  energy  consumption;  therefore,  energy  efficiency 
measures are promoted together. 
 
 
d. Reconstructing and building a decarbonized society in Fukushima 
 
The accident at the Tokyo Electric Power Company's Fukushima Daiichi 
Nuclear Power Station in March 2011 caused considerable injury to the people 
- 64 - 
  
of Fukushima Prefecture and many others. It is important that Fukushima, which 
sustained heavy damage of the nuclear disaster, takes a lead in showing the 
shape  of  a  future  energy  society  and  lead  global  decarbonization.  The 
Government will thus strongly steer Fukushima's recovery and revitalization. 
Fukushima  Prefecture  promotes  the  expansion  of  renewable  energy,  the 
accumulation of  related  industries and  R&D  in order  to make Fukushima a 
"pioneer of the renewable energy," which will be a major driving force for its 
reconstruction. Fukushima Prefecture also set the target to generate renewable 
energy for more than 100% of primary energy demands in Fukushima Prefecture 
by around 2040. Furthermore, the mayor of Fukushima Prefecture has declared 
that they will aim to achieve decarbonized society by 2050. To accelerate such 
efforts and give support the recovery of Fukushima from the energy sector, the 
Government, Prefecture and related companies work together to move forward 
with the initiatives, including the Fukushima Renewable Energy Institute, AIST 
(FREA) established in 2014. The Government will also provide human resource 
development for local companies related to renewable energy. 
"The Fukushima Plan for a New Energy Society" (decided by Council for 
Realizing the Fukushima Plan for a New Energy Society on September 7, 2016) 
formulated in 2016 was revised in February 2021. The second phase of the plan 
will begin in FY2021, raising renewable energy and hydrogen as its two pillars 
with the aim to deploy, and expand the use of, them broadly in society. The 
Government will work toward the realization of this plan by further expanding the 
introduction  of  renewable  energies  such  as  wind  power  generation  in  the 
prefecture, building a decentralized energy system such as local micro-grids 
using local renewable energies by diverse entities, promoting the technological 
development for further enlargement and modularization of water electrolysis 
equipment  using  the  Fukushima  Hydrogen  Energy  Research  Field  (FH2R) 
opened in Namie Town, and building a model for the realization of a hydrogen 
society so that hydrogen produced by FH2R is used in the prefecture. In addition, 
under the collaboration and cooperation agreement signed by the Ministry of the 
Environment and the Fukushima Prefecture (in August 2020), future-oriented 
urban development will be promoted. Through these efforts, toward the future of 
Fukushima as well as entire Japan, the Government will facilitate, and solidify in 
the local context, challenging efforts, which are essential for achieving net-zero 
by 2050, such as the maximum introduction of renewable energies and the social 
implementation of hydrogen.

The amount of carbon removal through land use, land-use change, and 
forestry activities in FY2019 under article 3.3 and 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol was 
42.9 million tons47 for forest sink measures, and 3 million tons48 for cropland 
management, grazing land management, urban revegetation, etc.

(FY2019, Final Figures) (Source: Compiled based on Japan's GHG Inventory) 
 
Considering  the  issues  such  as  declining  population  with  decreasing 
birthrates and aging population, emerging adverse impacts of climate change, 
energy challenges, intensifying global competition, aging infrastructure, and the 
expansion of the land that is difficult to be maintained appropriately, it is important 
to promote relevant policies for sustainable land management. 
In particular, forests, which account for approximately 70% of the national land, 
not only fulfill functions as land conservation, headwater conservation and wood 
supply  but  also  play  an  important  role  as  carbon  sinks  and  reservoirs  by 
sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. 
Wood products produced from sustainably managed forests also contribute 
to  emissions  reduction.  They  store  carbon  for  a  long  period  and  consume 
relatively  less  energy  for  their  production  process.  Wood  products  can  be 
repeatedly used through multiple stages in a cascading manner and can be 
converted to woody biomass as the end product to substitute for fossil fuels for 
                                                   
47 The net removals by forests in FY2019 are estimated based on the rules for the second 
commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, by combining emissions and removals from 
afforestation, reforestation, deforestation and forest management.

(emission of 5 million t-CO ) and the amount in FY1990 (emission of 8 million t-CO2).

energy  use.  While  the  net  removals  by  forests  have  been  decreasing 
continuously due largely to the maturity of planted forests, in order to achieve net-
zero by 2050, it is imperative to enhance the capacity of forests as carbon sinks 
by ensuring a “harvest, utilize wood and plant after harvest” cycle including 
through, sound forestry practices such as appropriate thinning, promotion of 
utilizing wood product sourced from matured planted forests, and creation of 
young forests with vigorous growth after harvest. 
Besides forests, cropland and grassland soils are internationally recognized 
as carbon sinks that contribute to GHG removals. 
 
(2) Future vision 
 
The  Future  vision  is  to  secure  and  strengthen  carbon  to  establish  a 
decarbonized society by 2050, in other words to achieve the balance between 
the GHG emissions by anthropogenic sources and removals by sinks. Therefore, 
the Government will promote activities in sustainable agriculture, forestry and 
fisheries  industries  that  create  new  values  with  conserving  the  natural 
environment. 
In particular, forest carbon sinks, which account for the great majority of 
carbon removals, should be managed in a way that, in accordance with the Basic 
Plan  for  Forest  and  Forestry  (Cabinet  Decision  on  June  15,  2021),  sound 
management of forests coupled with sustainable use of forest resources supports 
green  growth  of  the  forest,  forestry  and  wood  industry,  thereby  making  a 
contribution to the realization of net-zero by 2050. 
 
(3) Direction of policies and measures for the future vision 
 
a. Measures for forest carbon sinks 
 
With  regard  to  forest  the  Government  will  take  necessary  measures  as 
follows:  
  Securing and enhancing net removals by forest carbon sinks for a long 
period  through  enhancing  diversity  of  planted  forests  through  sound 
forestry practices such as thinning and creating young forests with vigorous 
growth  after  harvest  by  means  of  “elite  tree”  seedlings,  which  are 
developed  by  forest  tree  breeding  of  indigenous  tree  species  with 
significant potential of growing faster than conventional seedlings of the 
same species; 
  Reducing costs and adopting labor-saving forestry operations including for 
reforestation through the development and dissemination of elite trees that 
can allow for less mowing frequency at the initial stage of forestation;   
- 67 - 
  
  Adopting  integrated  operations  of  logging  and  planting  activities, 
introducing  low-density  planting  and  forestry  innovations  such  as  the 
automation of forestry machinery, and developing road networks with little 
impact on natural environment; 
  Fostering forestry management entities and forestry workers; and  
  Systematically  implementing  forest  conservation  measures  to  control 
hillside-derived  mountain  disasters,  and  promoting  management  and 
conservation of legally designated protection forests in the midst of the 
escalating risks of natural disasters caused by extreme weather events 
such as torrential rains.

(Source: Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries) 
 
With regard to timber and wood products, the Government will take the 
following necessary measures: 
  Promoting the use of locally distributed wood for housing and expanding 
the use of timber and wood products in public buildings and medium- and 
large-scale buildings through the development and diffusion of products 
and technologies such as CLT and wooden fireproof materials; 
  Developing, deploying and commercializing new wood-based materials 
made of cellulose nanofiber and glycol lignin, etc.; and 
  Undertaking  national  campaigns  for  promoting  sustainable  forest 
management and wood use, such as tree planting and forest management 
by a wide range of entities including companies and NPOs; the "Wood Use 
Movement" to raise awareness about the significance and benefits of wood 
use  for  environmental,  educational,  health  and  mental  aspects;  and 
network buildings among companies and other stakeholders with interests 
- 68 - 
  
in wood use.

ku), Right: Automobile using new wood materials such as glycol lignin)  
(Source: Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries) 
 
b. Cropland 
 
The  Government  will  promote  carbon  storage  in  cropland  soil  with  the 
application of organic matter such as compost and green manure to the soil, the 
development of new biochar materials that are more functional and easier to 
apply to cropland, and the application of biochar to cropland promoted by the J-
Credit Scheme. 
 
c. Urban revegetation 
 
Preservation and creation of urban green spaces that not only provide disaster 
prevention and disaster mitigation functions such as rainwater harvesting and 
infiltration, but also serve as CO  sinks, and urban greening, including rooftop 
2
and  wall  greening  in  public  utility  facilities  and  private  buildings,  will  be 
comprehensively promoted through public-private sector cooperation, and will be 
developed in line with the Town Walkable Promotion Program. 
 
d. The natural environment 
 
The Government will promote the NbS and enhance the functions of healthy 
ecosystems to remove CO  by carrying out the conservation and restoration of 
2
forests, grasslands, wetlands and such as peat swamps as well as ecosystems 
such as those in soil and coasts, which fixate much carbon. In addition, The 
Government  will  promote  appropriate  wildlife  control,  such  as  prevention  of 
damage and population management, in order to reduce the damage by wildlife 
causing significant impact on ecosystems such as forests. This management will 
continue  to  contribute  to  emissions  removal  by  healthy  ecosystems.  The 
Government further accelerates the reduction of stress on ecosystems other than 
- 69 - 
  
climate change — land use change, environmental pollution, overuse, invasion 
of alien species, etc.— together with the maintenance of ecological network that 
is the way used by wildlife for their move and disperse, in order to enhance the 
adaptability of ecosystems on climate change. 
Regarding "blue carbon", the carbon fixated in coastal areas and marine 
ecosystems, the Government will explore the possibilities of blue carbon as a 
CO  carbon sink, such as conservation and restoration of coastal vegetation 
2
using seagrasses and seaweeds in nationwide scale. In addition to this, the 
Government will facilitate the creation of new industries from marine resources 
with  new  materials  development  and  innovation,  such  as  functional  foods, 
biomass-based  plastics  and  Marine  biodegradable  plastic  that  use  aquatic 
organisms as raw materials.

e. Direct recovery of CO  from the atmosphere (DAC: Direct Air Capture) 
2
 
As regards the technology development for DAC (Direct Air Capture), they are 
still  in  the  stage  of  elemental  technology  development  worldwide,  although 
Western  venture  companies  are  accelerating  R&D  with  an  eye  on 
commercialization. In Japan as well, the development activities for practical use 
have started at the laboratory level in 2020. 
At  present,  energy  efficiency  is  low  and  CO   recovery  cost  from  the 
2
atmosphere is high. 
The Government will advance technological development on a highly efficient 
CO  recovery method from the atmosphere with the low cost, aiming for the 
2
practical use in 2050. 
   
- 71 - 
  
Chapter 3: Cross-sectoral Measures to be Focused 
 
Section 1: Promotion of Innovation 
 
In order to tackle the global challenge of climate change and to achieve a 
decarbonized society, which is the ultimate vision of the future, the creation of 
disruptive  innovation  beyond  a  mere  extension  of  conventional  efforts  is 
important. 
In order to realize a decarbonized society, it is important to overcome the 
simplistic view of “innovation is technological,” and to promote “innovation for the 
practical application and wide use” for the technology to be adopted in the society, 
putting  together  the  cutting-edge  technology  with  the  use  of  the  existing 
technology of much excellence. From this viewpoint, performance and efficiency 
are important, but as the performance cannot be shown unless chosen by the 
user, innovation that derives from actual needs and the vision of the future society 
is also important.  
Today, we are seeing the waves of global change and innovation as a result 
of  cross-sectoral  interactions  including  those  between  energy,  mobility,  and 
digitalization. This also means the promotion of wide-ranging innovation towards 
the realization of “Society 5.0,” while ensuring the security of the ICT, can lead to 
technological innovation necessary for significant reductions in GHG emissions. 
In the midst of the evolution in the AI, IoT and block chain technologies, the public 
and private sectors need to come together to make best efforts for cross-sectoral 
innovation.  In  a  society  with  rapid  changes  in  digitalization,  data  usage, 
decentralization and globalization, communities and open venues where diverse 
ideas can actively interact with each other have become more important for 
innovation. 
 
(1) Technological Innovation 
 
Buds of technology to realize net-zero by 2050 has already come to the 
surface through R&D conducted to date. In January 2020, the Government 
formulated the “Environment Innovation Strategy” (decided by the Integrated 
Innovation Strategy Promotion Council on January 21, 2020), aiming to establish 
innovative technologies for achieving the “Beyond-Zero” initiative to reduce CO  
2
that  has  accumulated  since  the  Industrial  Revolution,  under  which  the 
Government exhibited the issues to be overcome and has been engaged in 
intensive deliberations subsequently. The Environment Innovation Strategy, with 
the aim to establish innovative technologies by 2050, lays out the following 
aspects  for  each  of  the  39  themes,  which  will  be  utilized,  and  updated  as 
necessary, based on the progress of technology development. 
- 72 - 
  
1. The specific cost of the innovation and the amount of global GHG reduction 
to clarify the social impact 
2. Details of technological development 
3. Implementation system 
4. Specific scenarios and actions from elemental technology development to 
practical application and demonstration development 
 
Challenges  awaiting  ahead  of  the  establishment  of  such  innovative 
technologies are social implementation and cost reduction by investment for 
mass production. From the viewpoint of taking on the challenge of net-zero by 
2050 as a growth strategy, the Government has established “Action Plans” in the 
Green Growth Strategy in the key industrial fields where future growth is expected 
and efforts to reduce GHG emissions are essential to achieve net-zero by 2050. 
From the fields in which market is expected to grow from their current status 
through 2030 to those to launch through 2050, this strategy focuses on 14 fields 
with different time axis for growth. 
These fields, namely, energy-related industries, transportation/manufacturing-
related industries, household/office work-related industries and so on, are faced 
with different degree of necessities from one to another, from those require 
actions  in  current  “introduction  and  expansion  phase”  to  others  for  future 
"research and development phase." Considering characteristics of respective 
fields, the Government intends to incorporate concrete measures, which will 
strengthen Japan's international competitiveness and lead to autonomous market 
expansion. 
Through the steady implementation of the action plans in these fields, the 
Government will strive to enhance the feasibility of a carbon-neutral society by 
2050 year by year through the concerted efforts of the relevant ministries and 
agencies. 
 
a. Offshore wind power, solar energy and geo-thermal industry (Next-generation 
renewable energy) 
 
(a) Offshore wind power 
 
Given the feasibility of large-scale introduction and cost reductions as well as 
the anticipated economic ripple effects, offshore wind power generation holds the 
key to making renewable energy a main source of power. With a project scale of 
several tens of billions of yen and the number of pieces of equipment and parts 
totaling in the tens of thousands, the economic ripple effect on related industries 
will be significant. 
- 73 - 
  
It is important to make full-scale efforts to introduce offshore wind power in 
Japan from both energy policy and industrial policy perspectives while reducing 
costs by cultivating Japan's offshore wind power industry and strengthening 
competitiveness. 
It is also vital for the public and private sectors to work together to build 
strategies to capture growth markets in Asia in the future. Therefore, firstly, the 
Government is committed to creating an attractive domestic offshore wind power 
market to draw domestic and foreign investment. On top of that, the Government 
and the industry will develop a competitive and resilient domestic supply chain by 
promoting  investment  through  the  establishment  of  business  and  other 
infrastructure. In addition, the Government and the industry will engage in next-
generation technology development and international cooperation with an eye to 
expanding into Asia and create next-generation industries that can compete on 
the global stage. 
Based on “Vision for Offshore Wind Power Industry (1s)” (December 15, 2020) 
indicating the above direction, and by “Public-Private Council on Enhancement 
of Industrial Competitiveness for Offshore Wind Power Generation”, the efforts 
will be promoted by public-private partnership. 
 
(b) Solar energy 
 
The  introduction  of  solar  power  has  been  expanding  as  a  mainstay  of 
renewable energy, with the world's largest amount of solar power installed per 
square meter of land area. In addition, as a distributed energy resource (DER) 
for self-consumption and local production for local consumption, it is expected to 
be  used  from  the  perspective  of  resilience,  and  further  expansion  of  its 
introduction is essential to achieve carbon neutrality. 
On the other hand, the amount of solar power installed was 7-8 GW/year when 
the FIT system was first introduced, and has remained around 5-6 GW/year since 
2016, but the amount certified has dropped to 1.5 GW/year at present. This is 
thought to be the result of the efforts to optimize the industry by reducing the 
purchase price and strengthening business discipline, etc., in response to the 
rapid expansion that occurred when the industry as a whole was not yet mature 
after the introduction of the FIT system, but in the future it will be essential to draw 
a blueprint of the industry's expansion based on this history. 
At present, however, the global share of Japanese companies in solar module 
shipments has also declined significantly, falling to a share of 1.8% in 2019. 
In light of these circumstances, in order to further expand the introduction of 
solar power, it is urgent to create a new market in the medium and long term 
through the development of technology for next-generation solar cells that can be 
installed in places where it is difficult to install existing silicon solar cells, which 
- 74 - 
  
are the mainstream of the market, while aiming to expand the amount of solar 
cells introduced at present, based on the premise that the project is implemented 
by appropriate business operators in harmony with local communities. 
Specifically,  the  Government  will  work  to  develop  next-generation 
technologies, such as next-generation solar cells that can be installed in locations 
where existing solar cells are difficult to install due to technical limitations, and 
the Government will promote the expansion of the potential for using solar power. 
In  addition,  by  promoting  the  improvement  of  the  environment  through  the 
revitalization of related markets, etc., the Government will foster and restructure 
the industry, while securing suitable sites that can coexist with the region through 
the re-examination of various regulations and systems. 
 
(c) Geo-thermal 
 
Among the renewable energies that generates almost no CO  during power 
2
generation, geothermal power, unlike solar power generation and wind power 
generation, is a renewable energy source that can be used as a base-load power 
source. The promotion of geothermal power generation is very important as a 
power source that contributes to the stable introduction of renewable energy, as 
the maximum introduction of renewable energy is required to achieve net-zero by 
2050. 
Therefore, the Government will reduce development costs and development 
risks by conducting its own surveys of the extent of resources in suitable areas 
for development, providing risk money to business operators, and making efforts 
to foster local understanding. 
Based on the fact that 80% of Japan's geothermal resources are located in 
national and quasi-national parks, the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) will set 
a  target  to  double  the  number  of  geothermal  power  generation  facilities 
nationwide by 2030 and shorten the lead time by up to two years, based on the 
"Plan for Accelerating Geothermal Development" (Announced by the Ministry of 
the Environment on April 27, 2021), by reviewing the operation of the "Natural 
Parks Act" (Act No.161 of 1957) and the "Hot Springs Act" (Act No.125 of 1948), 
encouraging the establishment of promotion zones based on the revised Law for 
the  Promotion  of  Measures  to  Cope  with  Global  Warming,  collecting  and 
investigating scientific data such as hot spring monitoring, and working to achieve 
smooth regional coordination. As an aspect of the implementation of the Plan, it 
is necessary to accelerate development and expand development sites that are 
compatible with the conservation of the surrounding natural environment. 
Furthermore, toward 2050, on top of these efforts, the Government will utilize 
geothermal resources that have yet to be utilized so far by developing new 
technologies. 
- 75 - 
  
Through these efforts, it is important to aim for a significant introduction of 
geothermal power generation, and to promote the further growth of various 
industries related to geothermal development, such as drilling, turbines, and other 
power generation systems, as well as materials and components for drag wells. 
In particular, taking advantage of the fact that Japanese companies currently 
account for 70% of the turbines used for geothermal power generation in Japan 
and abroad, Japan will expand the market and strengthen the competitiveness of 
its  geothermal  industry  by  providing  support,  including  financial  support,  to 
developing  countries  for  the  vast  amount  of  undeveloped  geothermal 
development  in  the  world,  especially  in  developing  countries,  from  the 
preparation of master plans to exploration, exploratory drilling, excavation, and 
plant construction, together with the world's top-class power generation systems. 
Japan will also lead the world in developing next-generation geothermal power 
generation technologies, such as supercritical geothermal power generation, and 
sell  the  entire  power  generation  system,  including  supercritical  geothermal 
resource  exploration  technology,  deep  drilling  technology,  surface  and 
underground piping, and turbines, as a package to overseas markets. In this way, 
Japan  will  work  to  further  expand  the  overseas  development  of  Japan's 
geothermal industry. 
 
b. Hydrogen and fuel ammonia industry 
 
(a) Hydrogen 
 
Hydrogen, which can be widely used in various sectors (power generation, 
industry, and transportation etc.) is a key technology to achieve carbon neutrality. 
Although Japan was the first in the world to formulate the “Basic Hydrogen 
Strategy” (Decided by the Ministerial Conference on Renewable Energy and 
Hydrogen, etc. on December 26, 2017.) and possesses advanced technology in 
multiple fields, Europe and Korea among others have also established strategies 
and are following Japan. Hereafter, the Government positions hydrogen as a new 
resource,  and  will  involve  wide  range  of  players  not  limited  to  automobile 
applications. Moreover, for example, in the fields of usage, transportation and 
manufacturing, in addition to accelerating R&D, estimating global market size 
based on a certain hypothesis, and taking various measures described below, the 
Government will strive to strengthen industrial competitiveness, while promote 
decarbonization at the same time. 
By  increasing  introduction  amount,  Japan  aims  for  the  level  competitive 
enough against fossil fuels, i.e. supply cost of 30 yen/Nm3 in 2030 (less than one 
third of the current selling price) and hydrogen power generation cost lower than 
gas fired power generation cost (less than about 20 yen/Nm3) in 2050. As for the 
- 76 - 
  
target  amount,  while  recognizing  that  the  situations  are  different  between 
countries and regions with regard to renewable energy potential, market size and 
so on, from the viewpoint of early launch of the domestic hydrogen market, Japan 
aims  for  hydrogen  introduction  amount  of  up  to  3  million  tons49  in  2030. 
Specifically for the supply amount of clean hydrogen (hydrogen produced from 
fossil fuels + CCUS /Carbon Recycling, renewable energy and so on) in 2030, 
the target is to exceed the supply amount of hydrogen derived from renewable 
energy (ca. 420,000 tons) announced by Germany in their national hydrogen 
strategy published in June 2020. In addition, supply amount of ca. 20 million tons 
in 2050 is aimed for. 
 
(b) Fuel ammonia 
 
Ammonia, which does not emit CO  when it is burned, will be the main 
2
decarbonized fuel used in the transition to the hydrogen economy, being used for 
co-firing of thermal power (coal-fired etc.) and so on. A 20% co-firing of ammonia 
(on a calorie basis) in one coal-fired thermal power unit would result in a 20% 
reduction in CO  emissions, and if 20% co-firing were implemented in all coal-
2
fired thermal power units of Japan's major electric power companies, this would 
result in a reduction of approximately 10% of CO emissions from Japan's electric 
2 
power sector. 
On the utilization side, the technology to stabilize combustion and suppress 
NOx generation has already been completed for 20% co-firing, and from FY2021 
to FY2024, verification of 20% co-firing in actual equipment will be conducted. 
Practical application of the technology will begin in the second half of the 2020s, 
and domestic demand for fuel ammonia is expected to be on the scale of 3 million 
tons per year (approximately 500,000 tons of hydrogen equivalent) in 2030. In 
the 2030s, Japan will expand the introduction of these burners, and in the future, 
Japan will improve the co-firing rate and shift to single fuel firing, as well as 
expand the use of burners for power generation (co-firing and single fuel firing) 
to Southeast Asia and other regions. 
On the other hand, in terms of supply, Japan will be the first to construct an 
international supply chain by establishing new plants and so on, and take the 
initiative among suppliers and utilization industries of fuel ammonia. At the same 
time, Japan will develop technologies for large-scale production, transportation 
and storage of fuel ammonia, as well as for higher efficiency, in order to ensure a 
stable and low-cost supply. Utilization of other decarbonized fuels will also be 
considered. 
                                                   
49 The supply amount includes the introduced amount of hydrogen carrier including ammonia 
by direct use. 
- 77 - 
  
Through the measures for utilization and supply, a market of 1.7 trillion yen 
per year is expected in 2050, and domestic demand for fuel ammonia of about 
30 million tons per year (about 5 million tons in hydrogen equivalent) is assumed 
as a procurement supply chain that can be controlled by Japan, aiming for a 
demand volume of 100 million tons per year worldwide. 
 
c. Next-generation heat energy industry 
 
Heat demand accounts for about 60% of the energy consumption in the 
industrial and consumer sectors in Japan. Heat is essential for people's daily lives, 
and the Government can contribute to the decarbonization of heat demand by 
promoting  the  decarbonization  of  the  gases  that  supply  heat  energy  to  the 
demand side in order to achieve net-zero by 2050. 
For the decarbonization of gases, the direct use of synthetic methane and 
hydrogen synthesized (methanation) from hydrogen and CO2 derived from 
renewable energy sources, etc., is to be considered as its means. By promoting 
these efforts for the decarbonization of heat demand, an industry that supplies 
next-generation heat energy that achieves carbon neutrality (next-generation 
heat energy industry) will be born. 
The  realization  of  this  next-generation  heat  energy  industry  cannot  be 
achieved only by the efforts of the heat energy supply side (currently the gas 
supply business side). The decarbonization of gases will make a significant 
contribution to the decarbonization of all industrial and consumer sectors with 
heat demand, and it will be necessary to involve the demand side in the efforts to 
use the next generation of heat energy. 
Toward the realization of net-zero by 2050, Japan aims to create a next-
generation heat energy industry. 
 
d. Nuclear industry 
 
In order to realize net-zero by 2050, it is important to pursue every option, 
including nuclear power. Therefore, in addition to the further safety improvement 
of light-water reactors, it is necessary to proceed with R&D for nuclear power 
innovation by advanced technologies, which also contribute to improve reactor 
safety.  Nuclear  power  can  supply  mass-produced  and  stable  carbon-free 
electricity, and also boasts a high level of technological self-sufficiency. Japan will 
achieve further improvements in nuclear safety, reliability, and efficiency, the 
reduction in volume and harmfulness of high-level radioactive waste as well as 
the effective utilization of resources for improving natural resource recycling, with 
further innovation.  Nuclear power can also respond to various social needs, 
- 78 - 
  
such as coexisting with renewable energy, carbon-free hydrogen production, and 
heat utilization. 
The Government aims for the following future goals: 
  To consistently promote fast reactor development by utilizing international 
cooperation,  
  To demonstrate small modular reactor technology through international 
cooperation by 2030,  
  To establish component technologies related to hydrogen production at 
high-temperature gas-cooled reactor by 2030, 
  To  consistently  promote  fusion  energy  R&D  through  international 
collaboration such as the ITER50 project. 
 
e. Automobile and battery industries 
 
The Government will promote the electrification of automobiles. These efforts 
are not limited to the automotive industry, but involve energy supply, various 
industries, daily life and work, mobility and logistics, and regional and town 
planning, and must be actively mobilized as a package of support, regulations, 
and a wide range of other policies. In addition, it is necessary to show a variety 
of paths by optimally combining powertrain, energy, fuel, and other technologies, 
without being limited to specific technologies, so that Japan's industry can be 
internationally competitive. Furthermore, Japan's automotive industry is a key 
industry with world-class comprehensive technological capabilities that supplies 
vehicles to countries around the world, and it is necessary to take comprehensive 
measures  by  paying  attention  to  the  goals,  regulations,  support,  and  other 
measures  related  to  electrification  in  other  countries  and  the  status  of  the 
electrified vehicle market as a result of these measures. Since many of the related 
industries are dominated by small, medium, and micro-sized companies, the 
Government should aim to create an industrial structure that can positively work 
toward  the  realization  of  carbon  neutrality  by  responding  to  electrification, 
challenging new fields, changing business categories, diversifying, and fostering 
cooperation and mergers among companies. 
Based on this basic approach, Japan must aim to become a leader in this field 
by promoting the following initiatives. The Government will take comprehensive 
                                                   
50  ITER  (International  Thermonuclear  Experimental  Reactor)  Project: An  international 
collaborative  project  to demonstrate  the  scientific  and  technological feasibility  of an 
experimental nuclear fusion reactor through its construction and operation, based on an 
international commitment by seven parties including Japan, the United States, and the

measures to achieve 100% of new passenger vehicle sales being electrified by 
2035. 
With regard to commercial vehicles, for light-duty vehicles of 8 tons or less, 
the Government will take comprehensive measures, including the introduction of 
vehicles and promotion of infrastructure development, aiming for 20-30% of new 
vehicle sales to be electrified vehicles by 2030, and 100% of new vehicle sales 
to be electrified vehicles and vehicles suitable for the use of decarbonized fuels 
such as synthetic fuels combined by 2040. As for large vehicles over 8 tons, the 
Government will aim to introduce 5,000 units of electrified vehicles in advance in 
the 2020s while promoting technological demonstration to develop and promote 
the use of electrified vehicles suitable for commercial use such as cargo and 
passenger businesses. By 2030, the Government will also set a target for the 
diffusion  of  electrified  vehicles  in  2040,  taking  into  account  the  progress  in 
technological development and diffusion efforts to reduce the price of hydrogen 
and synthetic fuels. 
In order to continue to lead the global market for motorcycles, the shift to 
electrified vehicles will be promoted through initiatives in Japan and overseas, 
including  the  international  standardization  of  storage  battery  standards  and 
infrastructure development. 
In many countries, measures to promote the use of electric vehicles, etc., 
have been launched one after another. For example, some parts of Europe and 
the State of California have set targets to switch to zero-emission vehicles such 
as electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles by 2040 or earlier, while Europe and the 
United  States  are  considering  providing  approximately  250  billion  euros 
(inclusive) and 174 billion dollars, respectively, in support. 
The G7 Summit held in June 2021 also noted that it 
  commits to sustainable, decarbonized mobility and to scaling up zero-
emission  vehicle  technologies,  including  buses,  trains,  shipping,  and 
aviation; 
  recognizes  the  need  to  dramatically  increase  the  pace  of  the  global 
decarbonization of the road transport sector throughout the 2020s and 
beyond  (including  support  for  accelerating  the  roll-out  of  necessary 
infrastructure, such as charging and fueling infrastructure, and enhancing 
the offer of more sustainable transport modes, including public transport, 
shared mobility, cycling and walking); and 
  commits to accelerate the transition away from new sales of diesel and 
petrol cars to promote the uptake of zero-emission vehicles. 
 
In Japan, the introduction of electric vehicles will be strongly promoted during 
this decade to build a world-leading industrial supply chain and mobility society, 
starting with batteries. The Government will take special measures in this process, 
- 80 - 
  
especially for converting light vehicles (kei-cars) and commercial vehicles to 
electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles. It will also support "aggressive business 
transformation and business restructuring" to encourage parts suppliers, auto 
dealers, maintenance companies, and service stations (SS), which support the 
local economy, to respond to the accelerated shift to electrification. 
To  reduce  CO   emissions  and  activate  mobility  at  the  same  time,  the 
2
Government  will  also  work  on  resolving  local  mobility  issues  through  the 
transformation of how to use automobiles. For example, the ideal future mobility 
society is one in which traffic accidents and traffic congestion are reduced to zero. 
In  the  automotive field,  the  Government  will  promote the  implementation of 
automated driving and digital technologies in electrified vehicles. In this way, the 
Government  will  accelerate  the  social  implementation  of  new  services  and 
infrastructure that respond to users’ behavior change and electrification, with the 
aim of resolving mobility issues over the medium to long term. 
In addition, storage batteries are a "new energy infrastructure" that will play a 
key role in the advancement of digitalization and greening, such as carbon-free 
regulating power, which is necessary for the electrification of automobiles and the 
spread of renewable energy. The Government will strengthen batteries' industrial 
competitiveness through policies such as supporting  R&D, demonstrations, and 
capital  investment,  studying  institutional  frameworks,  and  developing 
international cooperation toward standardization. 
Through these initiatives and efforts to decarbonize energy, the Government 
will pursue various options for carbon neutrality and aims to achieve net-zero CO  
2
emissions through the production, use, and disposal of CO -emitting automobiles 
2
in 2050. 
 
f. Semiconductor/information and communication industries 
 
Amid rapidly advancing information utilization and digitization, an increasingly 
electrified  and  digitalized  society  can  realize  carbon  neutrality  in  all  fields 
including manufacturing, services, transportation, and infrastructure. Therefore, 
the semiconductor/information and communication industries, as a foundation for 
digitization  and  electrification,  are  the  key  to  advancing  green  and  digital 
initiatives at the same time. 
With regard to the semiconductor and information and telecommunications 
industries, the Government will promote two approaches as two wheels of a cart: 
(1) enhancing efficiency and reducing CO  emissions in energy demand through 
2
digitization  (Green  by  Digital),  and  (2)  promoting  energy  conservation  and 
greening  of  the  digital  equipment  and  information  and  telecommunications 
industries  themselves  (Green  of  Digital),  thereby,  aiming  to  achieve  carbon 
- 81 - 
  
neutrality  in  the  semiconductor/information  and  communication  industries  by 
2040. 
In particular, in order for Japan to lead the world in building a sustainable 
society where green and digital technologies are compatible, it is necessary to 
accurately  grasp  the  changing  trends  of  the  times  and  enhance  the 
competitiveness of the semiconductor and digital industries, which, as the "rice 
of industry," are deeply related to all economic and social activities, and play a 
fundamental  role  in  data  communication  and  processing.  Based  on  this 
background,  the  Ministry  of  Economy,  Trade  and  Industry  held  the 
"Semiconductor and Digital Industry Strategy Study Council" with experts as 
members, and by receiving various opinions, compiled the "Semiconductor and 
Digital Industry Strategy" in June 2021, which is focused on strengthening the 
competitiveness of semiconductors, promoting R&D, strengthening and optimally 
allocating  digital  infrastructure  such  as  data  centers,  and  fostering  digital 
industries  that  support  the  digital  society.  From  this  point  forward,  the 
Government will steadily implement the said strategy. 
 
g. Shipping industry 
 
Towards net-zero by 2050, shipping is expected to play a major role in import 
and export including the import of decarbonized fuels such as hydrogen. Carbon 
neutrality in the entire supply chain is also required. In order for Japan to secure 
stable maritime transportation as well, the Government will strive for carbon-
neutral maritime transportation by promoting the development of greener ships 
such as gas-fueled ships powered by LNG, hydrogen, ammonia and others, 
which are essential to achieve zero emissions, and by leading the establishment 
of  related  international  regulations  at  the  IMO.  By  technology  development 
supported by the Green Innovation Fund and other policy tools, the Government 
aims to start a demonstration project of zero-emission ships by 2025, realize the 
commercial operation of zero-emission ships before 2028, and further spread 
zero-emission ships towards 2030. In 2050, the fuel used for ships is expected to 
be converted into alternative fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia. 
Specifically, considering the current limitations of output, weight, and size, the 
Government will promote the development and practical use of core technologies 
such as hydrogen/ammonia-fueled engines, which has yet to exist in the world, 
for the use in long-distance and large ships, while facilitate the broader use of 
hydrogen fuel cell systems and battery propulsion systems for short-distance and 
small ships. 
In parallel with efforts to develop and implement these technologies, in order 
to  diffuse  zero-emission  ships,  it  is  necessary  to  establish  international 
frameworks including safety standards for hydrogen/ammonia-fueled ships. As 
- 82 - 
  
Japan has been leading the establishment of international regulations to improve 
energy efficiency of ships and others, Japan will continue to play the leading role 
in developing international frameworks for energy saving and decarbonization 
through the IMO. In addition, the Government will promote popularizing greener 
ships through the rating system for energy efficiency of coastal ships and other 
policy tools. By the end of 2021, the Government will formulate a roadmap for 
disseminating greener coastal shipping to achieve carbon neutrality, thereby 
implementing necessary measures.  
Figure 33 Hydrogen-fueled ship      Figure 34 Ammonia-fueled ship 
 
h. Logistics, people flow, and civil engineering infrastructure industries 
 
Logistics/people  flow  systems  and  civil  engineering  infrastructure,  which 
provide a foundation for all socioeconomic activities, are indispensable to the 
public's lives. The Government will strive for carbon neutrality through technology 
development and social implementation of an eco-friendly transportation network 
and  the  like  in  respective  phases  of  formulation,  introduction,  construction, 
maintenance, and utilization. . 
Specifically, the Government will move ahead with the following activities: (i) 
formation of Carbon Neutral Ports (CNP) for hydrogen imports, etc. (ii) introducing 
smart  traffic,  (iii)  streamlining  green  logistics  promotion  and  transportation 
networks, (iv) improving the efficiency of construction at sites, and promoting the 
spread of EV/FCV construction machinery, (v) pushing for more energy-efficient 
and sophisticated road facilities and conducting R&D on electric road system, (vi) 
urban compactness, (vii) area-based decarbonization in cities, (viii) promotion of 
the introduction of renewable energy in urban parks, etc., and (ix) reducing 
environmental loads in logistics and people flow at zero-emission ports. 
In addition, based on the "MLIT's Green Challenge" (decided by Ministry of 
Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism on July 6, 2021), the Government will 
strategically promote cross-sectoral decarbonization and other initiatives in the 
fields of livelihood, urban development, transportation, and infrastructure through 
the acceleration of technological innovation and its implementation in cooperation 
with the private sector. 
i. Food, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries 
- 83 - 
  
 
Japan's  food,  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fisheries  industries  are  important 
carbon sinks in their own right, as demonstrated by the widespread adoption of a 
"wood culture" with wood products being utilized in the right places for the right 
purposes, while forests, wood products, cropland, and oceans are expected to 
play a role as huge sinks for CO . In addition, rural areas have significant potential 
2
for achieving net-zero, as they can not only utilize renewable energy derived from 
locally  available  resources  such  as  land,  water,  and  biomass  that  exist  in 
agricultural, mountainous, and fishing villages, but also reduce GHG emissions, 
through work optimization by using smart technologies which emit less CO  and 
2
appropriate fertilization which emits less N O on the condition that fine farmlands 
2
are secured. 
However, while global warming in Japan continues to progress at a higher rate 
than that of the world average, the frequent occurrence of record-breaking heavy 
rains, typhoons, and heat waves all across the country have become one of the 
most serious risks to the agriculture, forestry, and fisheries industries. In recent 
years,  the  need  for  a  stable  food  supply,  and  sustainable  development  of 
agriculture, forestry, and fisheries doing no harm to the global environment, has 
been  strongly  emphasized.  In  the  food,  agriculture,  forestry,  and  fisheries 
industries which draw on the power of nature and ecosystems, it is a crucial and 
urgent task to reduce the impact of these activities on the environment and 
maintain a rich global environment. 
To address these issues, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
(MAFF)  formulated  the  “Strategy  for  Sustainable  Food  Systems,  MeaDRI 
(Measures for achievement of Decarbonization and Resilience with Innovation)" 
in May 2021 as a policy guideline to strategically address medium- to long-term 
perspective in order to enhance productivity potentials and ensure sustainability 
in a compatible manner of food, agriculture, forestry and fisheries industries 
through  innovation.  The  strategy  aims  to  promote  the  development  and 
deployment  of  innovative  technologies  and  production  systems  that  can  be 
adopted across the entire supply chain, from sourcing production, processing and 
distribution  to  consumption,  focusing  on  labor  savings  underpinned  by 
productivity  improvement,  utmost  use  of  locally  available  resources, 
advancement toward the net-zero, reduction of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, 
and conservation and restoration of biodiversity. By addressing these economic, 
social, and environmental issues in an integrated manner it is expected to achieve 
significant  benefits  for  building  a  sustainable  industrial  base  (economic), 
enriching people's diets as well as increasing employment and income generation 
opportunities  for  local  communities  (social),  making  a  contribution  to  the 
achievement of the carbon neutrality and maintaining a global environment as the 
base for future generations to lead secure lives (environmental). 
- 84 - 
  
Furthermore, Japan will advocate the MeaDRI Strategy as a new model of 
sustainable food system for the Asian monsoon region where climatic conditions 
and production structures are different from those of other regions like Europe 
and North America, and contribute to international dialogues and rule-making fora 
(e.g., the United Nations Food Systems Summit (September 2021)). 
 
j. Aircraft industry 
 
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has adopted a goal of no 
increase in CO  emissions from international aviation after 2020, and this goal 
2
will  be  achieved  through  a  combination  of  improved  flight  operations,  the 
introduction  of  new  technologies,  alternative  fuels,  and  the  use  of  market 
mechanisms. Meanwhile, International Air Transport Association (IATA) has set a 
goal of halving CO  emissions from 2005 levels by 2050. 
2
With  the  increasing  demand  for  decarbonization,  the  development  of 
decarbonization-related technology is indispensable from the viewpoint of climate 
change countermeasures and will contribute to maintaining and strengthening the 
competitiveness of Japan's aircraft industry. 
Therefore, Japan will promote the development of individual technologies and 
consider concrete measures to promote the introduction of new technologies into 
aircraft and equipment by reviewing and improving safety and environmental 
standards, thereby contributing to decarbonization of aircraft sector. 
 
k. Carbon Recycling and materials industry 
 
(a) Carbon Recycling 
 
Carbon  Recycling  is  a  key  technology  that  effectively  utilizes  CO   as  a 
2
resource for realizing a carbon-neutral society. 
The Carbon Recycling industry is diverse, as shown in the Roadmap for 
Carbon Recycling Technologies, which includes major fields such as minerals 
(concrete  products,  concrete  structures,  carbonates,  cement,  etc.),  fuels 
(microalgae jet fuel, microalgae diesel fuel, synthetic fuel, biofuel, gas fuel from 
methanation, etc.), chemicals (polycarbonates, urethane, etc. biomass-derived 
chemicals, general-purpose substances such as olefin and paraxylene), etc. 
Focusing on these major products, the Government will facilitate technology 
development for cost reduction as well as application development, promote 
social implementation, and aim for global development through the International 
Conference on Carbon Recycling. 
 
- 85 - 
  
(b) Materials 
 
Chemicals and cement are components of the carbon recycling industry, as 
well as the materials industry, which also includes metals and paper. These 
materials (part materials), including steel, are contained in all kinds of products 
that support people's lives, from spacecraft to automobiles, bullet trains, PCs, 
smartphones, houses, and daily necessities. Even in the carbon-neutral society 
of 2050, the role of these materials will remain unchanged, and they will continue 
to be used in all products that support daily lives. 
In addition, the industrial structure of manufacturing itself is about to shift from 
an era in which added value is sought by manufacturing a single product to an 
era in which solutions to social issues, such as low-carbonization, are proposed 
and managed for the entire process of other products and services. Against this 
backdrop, the materials industry is providing a variety of component materials 
while utilizing chemical reactions in energy-intensive environments such as those 
characterized by high temperatures and high pressures. Therefore, the materials 
industry is an industry that can be expected to grow further as it becomes a leader 
in process management with a view to carbon neutrality. 
The materials industry, which supplies materials for the products that form the 
foundation  of  society,  is  located  upstream  in  supply  chains  and  plays  a 
fundamental role in all industries, including infrastructure fields such as resources, 
energy, civil engineering, and construction, as well as manufacturing industries 
such as automobiles, electronics, and shipbuilding. At the moment, it employs 
about 1.64 million people and is a major contributor to the local economy and 
employment. 
However, the materials industry is faced with the problem of emitting a large 
amount of CO  in the manufacturing process. In fact, the iron and steel, chemical, 
2
manufacture of ceramic, stone and clay products, as well as paper industries emit 
relatively more CO  than any other industrial sector. In each of these industries, 
2
the heat sources must be decarbonized, and the processes themselves must be 
radically changed. Examples of such a drastic change is hydrogen-reduced iron 
making, which uses hydrogen instead of coal in the iron ore reduction process, 
and artificial photosynthesis, which produces plastic materials from water and 
CO . In order to decarbonize and reduce CO  emissions at the manufacturing 
2 2
stage  and  achieve  zero-carbon  manufacturing,  Japan  will  lead  the  world  in 
technology  development,  demonstration,  and  implementation  to  switch  to 
innovative manufacturing methods. 
All of the materials manufactured with innovative methods are expected to 
contribute to resource and energy conservation at the downstream stage by 
making them lighter and tougher, and demand for these materials is expected to 
increase  for  a  wide  range  of  applications.  Specifically,  the  Government  will 
- 86 - 
  
promote the development of carbon fiber (for aircraft and wind turbines), fine 
ceramics and carbon nanotubes (for innovative storage batteries, innovative 
photovoltaic  power  generation,  next-generation  semiconductors,  and  other 
components), and cellulose nanofibers (naturally occurring and contributing to 
the performance improvement of various components) based on strategies for 
downstream fields, aiming to expand the use of materials with high environmental 
performance and capture the market. In addition, the Government will work to 
improve the business environment, which is a prerequisite for doing business 
both in Japan and overseas. 
Through these efforts, the industrial base of the materials industry will be 
strengthened, while accelerating efforts toward net-zero by 2050, with the aim of 
achieving both further growth and development of Japan's materials industry. 
 
l. Housing and building industry and next-generation power management industry 
 
(a) Housing and Buildings 
 
The  houses/building  field  is  a  key  field  for  carbon  neutrality  in  the 
residential/business sectors, and once built, becomes a long-term stock; and is a 
field that should be addressed immediately. The global trend in Europe, United 
States and other countries, is to aim for carbon neutrality through bold investment 
in heat insulation renovations in houses and buildings and introducing solar-
power generation, which creates a market towards employment and economic 
recovery  affected  by  COVID-19,  as  well  as  improving  the  quality  of  life  by 
supplying high-quality housings. Japan has been working on the improvement of 
energy efficiency performance, the promotion of life cycle carbon minus (LCCM), 
the conversion to ZEH/ZEB, and the extension of life of houses and buildings, but 
the progress is halfway through. Upon aiming for the net-zero by 2050 in the 
future, in addition to the spread of LCCM houses and buildings that make CO
2 
emissions negative throughout its lifecycle (from construction to dismantling, 
reuse, etc.), the spread of ZEH/ZEB, the promotion of energy-efficient renovation, 
introduction  of  high-performance  heat  insulating  materials,  high-efficiency 
equipment,  and  renewable  energy,  and  the  using  wood  for  construction  of 
buildings will be promoted as much as possible. Regarding renewable energy, if 
the thin and lightweight next-generation solar cells, which Japan has strengths in, 
are put into practical use, installing solar panels on the roofs of existing houses 
and buildings with a small load capacity, and on the walls and windows of houses 
and buildings, which are now technically difficult will become possible and the 
goal to realization will become closer. At the same time, it is necessary to promote 
energy management that contributes to the adjustment of power supply and 
- 87 - 
  
demand according to the amount of power generated by the photovoltaics system, 
using the energy management system (HEMS/BEMS) of the house/building. 
 
(b) Next-generation power management 
 
With the changes in the structure of electricity supply represented by the 
massive introduction of renewable energy, there are concerns that the spatial gap 
(distance between large demand areas and suitable power generation areas) and 
temporal gap (gap between demand and power generation) between electricity 
demand and supply will expand, and that grid congestion and power quality 
problems will become more serious. In order to realize a carbon-neutral society 
while curbing the burden on the public, it is important to maintain and review the 
necessary regulations in order to effectively respond to these issues, and at the 
same  time,  to  encourage  the  development  of  a  "next-generation  electricity 
management industry" that utilizes ever-advancing digital technology and uses 
more advanced methods for forecasting, operating, and controlling electricity 
management for business development, through institutional responses including 
market development and various support measures. 
The next-generation power management industry includes businesses that 
utilize  and  provide  values  of  distributed  energy  resources  (DERs),  such  as 
renewable energy, fuel cells, cogeneration, storage batteries, and demand-side 
resources, as well as next-generation grid businesses that upgrade the operation 
of power transmission and distribution systems and form facilities based on the 
premise of increasing and utilizing DERs. It also includes microgrid businesses 
as a form of fusion of the two in specific regions, and, in a broader sense, 
businesses that provide platforms such as systems, equipment, and databases 
that make these businesses possible. 
The development of these businesses and industries is expected to bring a 
variety of benefits to consumers and other electricity consumers. For example, 
the electricity generated by roof-mounted solar power equipment can be used 
without waste. Also, the use of electrical equipment in houses can be adjusted to 
the necessary extent based on electricity supply, demand, and price trends, and 
the recharging and discharging of EV storage batteries can be managed optimally, 
leading to savings in electricity bills compared to the situation without such 
optimal power management. At the same time, advanced use of the increasing 
number of DERs and the sophistication of various forecasting, operation, and 
control technologies are expected to help improve resilience by reducing the 
probability of power outages due to disasters, etc., and the extent of their impact, 
as  well  as  speeding  up  the  restoration  process.  In  the  future,  quantitative 
verification of these effects will also be conducted. 
- 88 - 
  
The direction and major initiatives planned for the time being regarding the 
expansion of the introduction of DERs, the support of related businesses, and the 
construction of next-generation grids are also indicated in the "Basic Energy 
Plan." In the future, specific discussions and examinations will continue in the 
"Advisory  Committee  on  Natural  Resources  and  Energy"  and  in  practical 
examination forums in which related businesses, etc. participate, and initiatives 
will be promoted through the cooperation of the public and private sectors. 
 
m. Resource circulation-related industries 
 
Regarding  the  goals  of  3R+Renewable,  the  Government  is  supporting 
technology development and social implementation through laws and planning. 
Waste power generation, heat utilization, biogas utilization, etc. have already 
entered  the  commercial  phase  and  are  becoming  more  widespread  and 
sophisticated. In the future, these efforts will be further promoted by advancing 
and  optimizing  technology,  improving  equipment,  lowering  costs,  advancing 
digitalization, etc. and then, Japan will reduce GHG emissions to net-zero by 
2050 while advancing the transition toward the Circular Economy. 
 
(a) Reduce and Renewable 
 
As regards the goal of Reduce, the Government will demonstrate a system 
for sharing necessary information on used products and materials among related 
parties in order to promote efficient resource circulation and CO  saving. In 
2
respect of the goal of Renewable (biomass conversion, utilization of recycled 
materials,  etc.),  the  Government  will  promote  technology 
development/demonstration, development/sophistication of recycling technology, 
equipment maintenance, and demand creation for higher functionality of biomass 
materials and expansion/cost reduction of applications for further expansion of 
recycling. 
 
(b) Reuse, Recycle, and utilization of exhaust gas 
 
The  Government  will  develop  and  advance  high-performance  recyclable 
materials and recycling technology, optimize collecting routes, expand installed 
capacity, and further expand reusing, and recycling.  
In particular, based on the "Act on Promotion of Resource Circulation for 
Plastics" and other relevant laws and regulations, the Government will take 
measures  to  promote  efforts  for  resource  circulation  for  plastics  by  all 
stakeholders  throughout  the  lifecycle  of  them,  from  designing  products  to 
- 89 - 
  
disposing waste. Similarly, promotion of resource circulation for other materials 
than plastics will be further considered. 
Regarding  the  utilization  of  exhaust  gases  and  other  materials  from 
incineration facilities, while considering the use of the Green Innovation Fund, the 
Government will promote efforts toward practical use and social implementation 
of those gases by developing and scaling up innovative technologies, reducing 
costs of them, etc. through demonstration projects such as combustion control to 
facilitate the recovery of CO  from waste treatment facilities as well as separation, 
2
recovery, and utilization of CO  from low-concentration exhaust gases containing 
2
various impurities. 
 
(c) Waste  power  generation,  heat  utilization,  biogas  conversion,  fixation  of 
exhaust gas 
 
As regards waste power generation, due to major changes in the quality of 
waste in the future (such as an increase in the ratio of kitchen waste due to a 
decrease  in  the  ratio  of  plastic  waste),  there  is  a  concern  that  the  power 
generation  efficiency  will  decrease.  The  Government  will  proceed  with 
technological development to ensure high-efficiency energy recovery. 
In addition, as a measure to mitigate climate change, in order to promote the 
use of trees generated in the ongoing maintenance and management of rivers 
(felled trees, driftwood, etc.) as a renewable energy resource for biomass power 
generation, the Government will examine the possibility to improve efficiency in 
the maintenance and management and effectively utilize general waste treatment 
facilities. 
As for heat utilization, the Government will promote the improvement and cost 
reduction of heat storage and transportation technologies to supply heat to distant 
facilities. 
With  regard  to  biogasification,  the  Government  will  promote  technical 
demonstration projects in anticipation of the need for large-scale methanization 
facilities in line with major changes in the quality of waste in the future In order to 
expand the use of sewage biomass, the Government will make intensive efforts 
until FY2025 to promote the formation of projects among local governments, 
including  the  enhancement  of  the  "Sewage  Energy  promoting  Concierge 
Programme." 
As  for  the  fixation  of  exhaust  gases  from  incineration  facilities,  the 
Government will develop the technology at the lab level to fix CO  which is 
2
separated and recovered from the exhaust gases from waste incinerators, etc. 
 
 
n. Lifestyle-related industries 
- 90 - 
  
 
In order to make our lives carbon-neutral while maintaining resilience and 
comfortability by 2050, the Government will put effort in decarbonization of our 
lifestyle, in consideration of the discussion in the Council for National and Local 
Decarbonization. 
 
(a) Total management of housing and transportation 
 
The Government will work on establishing the methods for total management 
of  housing  and  mobility  including  by  facilitating  practical  use  of  ZEH,  ZEB, 
demand side equipment (home appliances, boilers and etc.), local renewable 
energy and EV/FCVs in a combined manner.The Government will also promote 
the  demonstration  and  the  social  implementation  of  technologies,  such  as 
networking  houses  and  buildings  by  using  renewable  energy  electricity  and 
heating that is close to demand side and DC power supply, ensuring flexibility 
consistent with the mainstreaming renewable energy utilizing hydrogen, and 
sector coupling of electricity, heating and mobility. 
 
(b) Behavior change by means of nudge, digitalization, and sharing, etc. 
 
In order to materialize the concept of fusion of behavioral insights such as 
nudge and cutting-edge technologies (BI-Tech) in social implementation, the 
Government  will  further  accelerate  the  efforts  to  digitalize  that  behavioral 
information, which is to be aggregated and analyzed. The Government will pursue 
the  development,  implementation  and  standardization  of  further  advanced 
system technology which supports personalized, eco-friendly, and comfortable 
lifestyle. 
The Government will also promote the construction of smart cities equipped 
with a decentralized energy system nationwide, while ensuring security. 
What is more, the Government will promote the establishment of business 
models related to decarbonized mobility by car-sharing of EVs utilizing local 
renewable energy, and community-serving decarbonized logistics utilizing battery 
exchange type EVs and battery stations, and then horizontally diffuse on a 
nationwide base). 
 
(c) Enhancement of scientific infrastructure related to observation and models 
 
In order to estimate the CO  emissions more accurately, the Government will 
2
improve  spatiotemporal  resolution,  further  elucidate  the  mechanisms  of  the 
climate change, improve the accuracy of climate change projection information, 
continue  observation  and  monitoring,  promote  further  utilization  of  GHG 
- 91 - 
  
observation data and climate change projection information through the data 
integration/analysis system (DIAS), and enhance the scientific infrastructure. 
Furthermore,  the  observation  network  and  the  analysis  system  will  be 
integrated and upgraded to improve spatiotemporal resolution and estimation 
accuracy,  and  to  quantify  GHG  balance  in  whole  area  including  natural 
ecosystem. 
The  Government  will  promote  cross-disciplinary  R&D  including  from 
humanities and social sciences to natural sciences. To enrich the fundamental 
knowledge  related  to  the  methods  of  introducing  effective  technologies  and 
measures, as well as to promote the social implementation of such knowledge, 
the Government established “University Coalition for Carbon Neutrality 2050” to 
strengthen the cooperation between universities and between industry, academia 
and government. 
 
(2) Innovation in Economic and Social Systems 
 
Together with innovation to create technologies, “innovation in economic and 
social systems,” in which technologies are put to wide use, is indispensable to 
achieve  decarbonization  of  the  society.  In  particular,  in  order  to  make  the 
maximum use of private sector abilities and attract finance and investment, it is 
imperative for the Government to provide a “consistent climate change policy 
towards  an  ambitious  vision”  and  “preparing  environment  for  investment.” 
Technological innovation starts to reduce GHG emissions only after it has come 
to be used throughout the society. Policies to encourage corporate efforts and 
promote  the  creation of  self-sufficient  business  models  are  required  for  the 
outcome of the innovation to be used throughout the society. At the same time, 
while  performance  and  efficiency  are  important  aspects,  they  will  remain 
untapped unless chosen by the user. Accordingly, the Government will pursue 
measures to achieve innovation in economic and social systems, including a spur 
to the user’s choice of innovation for decarbonization. Furthermore, in developing 
renewable energy and/or updating housings, buildings, and infrastructure, which 
take time for introduction and involves various stakeholders, the Government will 
ensure their effectiveness by institutional reforms as well as support measures. 
 
(3) Lifestyle innovation 
 
“Lifestyle  innovation,”  shifting  the  way  of  life  of  each  citizen  towards 
sustainability, provides a major impact directly and indirectly on climate change 
through consumer behaviors and the use of fuels, energy, and resources. The 
shift from consuming goods to utility and price-driven to quality-driven, as well as 
- 92 - 
  
the expansion in “ethical consumption51” is part of an overall economic shift “from 
quantity to quality”; a shift from mass production and mass consumption to small 
lot, high added value production and consumption, fully aligned with the move 
towards the decarbonization of society. These changes are creating new demand, 
leading to innovation in new goods and services. 
In order to make it easier for citizens to choose decarbonizing behaviors, the 
Government  will  promote  the  "visualization"  of  CO   emissions  by  using 
2
technologies such as digitalization and blockchain to quantify and certify the 
environmental  value  of  products  and  services.  In  addition,  based  on  the 
information obtained through visualization including through points, nudges, and 
ambassadors, consumers will be encouraged to choose products and services 
that contribute to decarbonization and to take decarbonization actions such as 
saving electricity and eco-driving. Ultimately, the goal is to make CO  emissions 
2
from all products and services "visible" so that consumers become oriented and 
incentivized  to  choose  their  actions,  including  automatic  selection  by AI.  In 
addition, while holding dialogues, the Government will analyze if the transition will 
be accelerated toward a decarbonized society through lifestyle changes that may 
continuously come about in the future. 
 
Section 2: Promotion of Green Finance 
 
Toward net-zero by 2050, the Government will draw in private investment 
using governmental funds as priming water. The International Energy Agency 
(IEA) estimates that up to 8,000 trillion yen will be needed worldwide to achieve 
the Paris Agreement goals. In addition to renewable energy (green), financing is 
needed for the transition to decarbonization (transition) through steady low-
carbon  efforts  such  as  energy  conservation,  and  for  innovative  technology 
(innovation) for decarbonization. 
According  to  the  Climate  Innovation  Finance  Strategy  2020  (decided  by 
Ministry  of  Economy,  Trade  and  Industry  on  September  16,  2020),  the 
Government will take measures to attract private investment into green, transition 
and innovation initiatives. 
With regard to green finance, the green bond market is expanding steadily 
both domestically and internationally, with annual domestic issuance exceeding 
                                                   
51 Consumption behavior that takes into consideration people, society, and the environment, 
including  regional  revitalization  and  employment.  For  example,  in  addition  to 
"consideration for the environment" such as Eco Mark products, recycled products, and 
products  certified  for  sustainable  forest  management  and  fishery,  "consideration  for 
society" such as fair trade products and products with donations, and "consideration for 
people" such as products that support the disabled, local production for local consumption 
and consumption in support of products produced in disaster-affected areas are also 
considered to be included in ethical consumption. 
- 93 - 
  
1 trillion yen by 2020. In order to further promote green finance, including green 
bonds, the Government will improve our issuance support system, and further 
study  the  use  of  funds  to  be  raised,  the  procedures  for  issuance,  and  the 
environment, based on international trends and issuance results, and revise the 
Green Bond Guidelines in FY2021. 
Transition finance is the concept of providing funds for GHG reduction efforts 
based on a long-term strategy to realize a decarbonized society. There is a 
concern that the steady efforts of companies to make the low-carbon transition 
would not be appropriately evaluated if solely based on the dual categorization of 
either "green" or "non-green" activities. Based on the "International Principles on 
Transition Finance" published in December 2020, Japan has formulated its own 
"Basic Guidelines on Climate Transition Finance"(decided by Financial Services 
Agency, Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and Ministry of the Environment 
on May 2021). Founded on the Basic Guidelines, sector-specific roadmaps (steel, 
chemicals, pulp and paper, cement, electricity, gas, oil, etc.) will be sequentially 
developed in FY2021 for high-emission industries that cannot decarbonize in a 
single step. In order to promote energy transition in emerging countries in Asia 
and elsewhere with the aim of achieving global carbon neutrality, Japan will also 
promote the formulation and dissemination of the concept of an "Asian version of 
transition  finance"  based  on  the  domestic  Basic  Guidelines. Along  with  the 
formulation of various "transition" paths (roadmaps) based on each country's 
needs for economic growth, economic and geographical diversity, energy policies, 
etc., Japan will formulate a framework for transition finance for Asia based on the 
Basic Guidelines, and seek to involve these countries through various initiatives 
to realize transitions. 
In  addition,  for  businesses  that  have  been  approved  for  their  long-term 
business plans of 10 years or more, a long-term funding mechanism to realize 
the plans and a results-linked interest subsidy system (loan size of 1 trillion yen 
over three years) have been established in the Act on Strengthening Industrial 
Competitiveness (Act No. 98 of 2013) to promote long-term transition initiatives 
by businesses. 
Furthermore, by  utilizing  a  leasing method  which  is  expected  to  have a 
significant effect on inducing capital investment, the Government will promote 
initiatives  to  encourage  private  enterprises  to  actively  invest  in  advanced 
equipment that contributes to low-carbon development, with the aim to induce 
investment of 150 billion yen or more. 
Regarding  the  innovation  finance,  the  Government  has  been  conducting 
visualization of enterprises that have been engaged in decarbonization to provide 
information for investors (Zero-Emission Challenge: 325 companies as of March 
2021). In the future, the Government will expand the target industrial fields and 
create opportunities of dialogues for investors, enterprises and policymakers to 
- 94 - 
  
call in finance to enterprises working on decarbonization innovation. 
In addition, the Government will provide risk money support to green ventures 
including renewable energy business (e.g., offshore wind power), utilization of 
low fuel consumption technology, and next-generation storage battery business. 
Specifically, the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) has established the "Green 
Investment Promotion Fund" (project scale: 80 billion yen) as part of its specific 
investment  operations.  In  addition,  in  January  2021,  the  Japan  Bank  for 
International Cooperation (JBIC) established the "Post-Corona Growth Facility" 
(project size: 1.5 trillion yen) to support the overseas development of high-quality 
infrastructure and other overseas business activities by Japanese companies 
toward a decarbonized society. 
While governments and institutions in Japan and abroad are working on 
various  guidelines  for  sustainable finance, there  is  a  growing  demand from 
companies and investors for a comprehensive set of guidelines from a practical 
perspective. While taking these points into account, in addition to the revision of 
the Green Bond Guidelines mentioned above, guidelines for social bonds will be 
formulated, and the formulation of a document that provides a wide range of 
examples of specific indicators, etc. for solving social issues will be considered. 
In addition, from the perspective of providing information that is highly convenient 
from the perspective of companies and investors, stock exchanges, in particular, 
will take the lead in establishing an information infrastructure that includes the 
provision of market information, etc. 
With the  aim  of  creating  a  "Green  International  Financial  Center"  where 
transactions of green bonds, transition bonds, etc. are actively conducted, the 
Financial Services Agency and others will encourage the private industry to 
establish a certification framework for evaluating the eligibility of green bonds, etc. 
(where an external organization objectively certificates the eligibility of green 
bonds,  etc.  on  the  premise  of  an  external  evaluation),  in  addition  to  the 
establishment of the above-mentioned information infrastructure. In addition, the 
FSA  and  others  will  examine  the  nature  of  ESG  evaluation  organizations 
(transparency,  governance,  etc.)  in  light  of  some  comments  that  external 
evaluation methods for ESG, etc. are not always clear. 
With  regard  to  sustainability-related  disclosure,  following  the  revision  of 
Japan's Corporate Governance Code in June 2021, companies listed on the 
prime  market  are  encouraged  to  enhance  the  quality  and  quantity  of  their 
disclosure based on the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure 
(TCFD) or an equivalent international framework. 
Japan  will  actively  participate  in  the  development  of  a  comparable  and 
harmonized disclosure framework for sustainability, including climate change, by 
the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation, including by 
providing opinions. 
- 95 - 
  
In addition, financial  institutions  will  be encouraged  to  help  their  lending 
counterparts address climate change and contribute to the creation of business 
opportunities. A guidance will be developed by supervisors to require financial 
institutions to manage their own risks related to climate change. 
In addition, the role of regional finance is important from the perspective of 
promoting the decarbonization of each local region in Japan, where the focus is 
on indirect finance. In order to link the decarbonization of the regions to the 
creation of a virtuous cycle between the economy and the environment therein, 
the Government should set out a clear vision for the regions and promote ESG 
finance by focusing on the environment, economy, and society by cooperating 
with  leading  regional  financial  institutions,  providing  them  with  information, 
sharing know-how, and promoting the creation of models for building businesses 
that make use of regional resources and solving regional problems. 
 
Section 3: Business-led promotion of International Application, and International 
Cooperation 
 
Climate change is not a problem which can be solved by the Japan’s effort 
alone in reducing GHG emissions. Rather, it is imperative that the entire world 
needs to work together to reduce the emissions. For this reason, Japan will 
demonstrate its international leadership in driving the decarbonization of the 
world. At the G7 Cornwall Summit, the leaders confirmed their commitments to 
efforts to achieve a net-zero goal by 2050 at the latest as well as increased 2030 
targets that each country had committed in line with the 2050 goal. G7 also 
concurred  on  phasing  out  new  direct  government  support  for  international 
carbon-intensive fossil fuel energy as soon as possible, with limited exceptions, 
and committed now to an end to new direct government support for unabated 
international  thermal  coal  power  generation  by  the  end  of  2021.  G7  also 
reaffirmed the collective developed country goal to jointly mobilize $100 billion 
per  year  as  climate  finance  contributions  from  2021  through  to  2025,  and 
committed as G7 to increase and improve G7’s overall international public climate 
finance contributions for this period. 
Building on the established confidence, Japan will expand its cooperative 
partnership  with  other  countries. At  the  same  time,  toward  2050,  with  the 
decarbonization of buildings which will be a long-term stock source of emissions 
as well as the widespread use of negative emission technologies kept in mind, 
Japan will promote international application of the products and goods with high 
environmental performance, thereby leading global efforts and contributing to 
global  reduction  of  emissions,  with  Japanese  advanced  technologies,  and 
through further improvement of the environment, such as market creation, human 
resource development, and establishment of institutional platforms. 
- 96 - 
  
With regard to the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), Japan will implement in 
line with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, Japan will contribute to GHG emission 
reductions and removals in partner countries through the diffusion of leading 
decarbonization technologies and the implementation of mitigation actions and 
also use to achieve Japan's emission reduction target. This will promote global 
GHG emission reductions and removals, and thereby contribute to the realization 
of carbon neutrality in the world. 
In order to promote the development of innovative technologies and their 
social implementation toward the realization of net-zero by 2050, it is essential to 
have an integrated industrial policy perspective for both inside and outside Japan. 
As the market for decarbonization technologies is expected to expand due to the 
acceleration of initiatives for carbon neutrality not only in the domestic market but 
also in other countries including emerging economies, Japan will strive to capture 
the share in this growing market, and then strengthen the competitiveness of its 
domestic industry through cost reductions that take advantage of economies of 
scale. At the same time, Japan will bring inward foreign capitals, technologies, 
sales channels, and management through direct investment into Japan, domestic 
and foreign collaboration, and M&A. In order to achieve sustainable growth 
through  such  efforts,  it  is  necessary  for  Japan  to  lead  the  discussion  in 
international cooperation and multilateral and bilateral international negotiations 
by actively proposing rule-making and the formulation of standards and criteria. 
 
(1) Cooperation with major countries 
 
With  major  countries  such  as  the  U.S.  and  European  countries,  the 
Government of Japan will work on cooperation in innovation policies, promotion 
of individual projects in critical industrial fields and other relevant fields including 
by  the  support  for  initiatives  in  third  countries  including  emerging  countries 
towards decarbonization, standardization of elemental technologies in critical 
industrial fields, and making of relevant rules (e.g., removal of trade barriers). 
Also, with emerging countries in Asia that are especially important from the 
viewpoint of promoting global decarbonization, taking into account relatively large 
social and economic restrictions of Asian emerging countries compared with 
developed  countries,  Japan  needs  to  facilitate  them  to  be  committed  to 
decarbonization via more practical approach, while cooperating with international 
organizations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Economic 
Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA). From such a viewpoint, in 
line with the needs of each country, Japan will comprehensively cooperate with 
Asian emerging economies and other countries in the efforts in transition toward 
decarbonization , including from the formulation of long-term strategies and plans 
for that country, through the establishment of policies and institutions, to the 
- 97 - 
  
implementation of individual projects in each sector, aiming at promoting an early 
transition toward decarbonization and encouraging market creation. In order to 
respond to the diverse needs of each country, in line with the idea that a realistic 
transition is essential, utilizing various energy sources and technologies in line 
with the actual conditions of each country and region, Japan will propose a wide 
range  of  solutions  towards  decarbonization  including,  but  not  limited  to, 
renewable  energy,  CO   recovery,  nuclear  power,  hydrogen/biofuel,  
2
ammonia/hydrogen mixed fuel or single fuel firing that uses existing infrastructure, 
and  decarbonization  of  fossil  fuels.  Some  of  the  solutions  shall  also  cover 
financial,  technological  and  human  resources  aspects.  In  addition,  from  the 
viewpoint of market acquisition, Japan will promote bilateral and multilateral 
cooperation. 
 
(2) International dissemination and cooperation through International Events 
 
Based on these domestic and international trends, under the brand of Tokyo 
“Beyond-Zero”  Week,  the  Government  will  intensively  hold  energy-  and 
environment-related international discussions by inviting experts and leaders in 
various countries and industrial fields, globally disseminating Japan’s growth 
strategies to realize a virtuous cycle of the economy and the environment toward 
carbon  neutrality  (ICEF),  promoting  cooperation  among  advanced  research 
institutions  (RD20)  and  developing  an  environment  toward  realization  of 
innovation and mobilization of fund for supporting transition (TCFD Summit). In 
addition, the Government will utilize the Tokyo “Beyond-Zero” Week as a platform 
for leading international discussion and cooperation in such priority industrial 
fields as hydrogen, Carbon Recycling, and decarbonization of fossil fuel. 
At the same time, through “Japan Environmental Week” and “Zero Carbon 
City  International  Forum,”  etc.,  the  Government  will  disseminate  Japan’s 
initiatives toward decarbonization. In addition, Japan will promote international 
cooperation in the field of climate change by discussing climate change issues in 
developing  countries  in Asia  and  other  countries  with  various  stakeholders, 
including  central  and  local  governments,  private  companies,  and  research 
institutes, and identifying local needs for cooperation. 
 
Section 4: Budget (Green Innovation Fund) 
 
Achieving net-zero by 2050 requires more ambitious attempts for innovation 
than ever. For that reason, in particularly important fields and projects therein, 
once  the  public  and  private  sectors  share  bold  and  specific  goals,  the 
Government will provide continuous support for companies committed to taking 
on challenges toward achieving the goals, from R&D through demonstration to 
- 98 - 
  
social implementation. To this end, the Government has established a 2 trillion 
yen  "Green  Innovation  Fund"  and  decided  to  assign  the  New  Energy  and 
Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) to its operation. 
For the priority fields that are essential for a carbon-neutral society and form 
the  basis  of  industrial  competitiveness,  ambitious  2030  targets  will  be  set 
(performance, amount of installation, price, CO  reduction rate, etc.) based on 
2
the implementation plan of the Green Growth Strategy, and ambitious projects 
from R&D through demonstration to social implementation by companies that 
demonstrate their commitment to these targets will be continuously supported for 
the next 10 years. 
Regarding the management of the Fund's projects, discussions were held at 
the Green Innovation Project Subcommittee of the Industrial Structure Council, 
and a "Basic Policy of the Green Innovation Fund's project” (decided by Ministry 
of Economy, Trade and Industry on March 2021) was formulated in March 2021 
to ensure the execution of R&D, demonstration and social implementation over a 
long period of time. Amidst globally intensifying competition among businesses 
for leadership toward a carbon-neutral society, in order to maximize the results of 
each project, the following evaluation axes is established based on this policy. 
  Potential to contribute to CO  reduction and economic ripple effects, etc. 
2
  Necessity of policy support based on the degree of technical difficulty and 
the possibility of practical application 
  Potential market growth and international competitiveness 
Based on the above, priority investment will be given to projects of particular 
importance. With  the  participation  of  external  experts  with  a  wide  range  of 
expertise in management, technology, new business, finance, etc., the content 
and  priority  of  each  project  will  be  discussed  and  assessed. After  careful 
examination by both the Government and NEDO, the project will be launched 
sequentially from the summer of 2021. 
It should be noted that there are some areas where it would be effective to 
encourage the participation of SMEs and start-ups that underpin the base of the 
supply chain and play a role in creating new industries. 
At the same time, the Government will seek a strong commitment from the top 
management to the goals of the projects as one of the most critical business 
issues,  and  working  groups  established  under  the  Subcommittee  will 
continuously check the status of initiatives, etc. with a wide range of stakeholders. 
Specifically, at the time of adoption, the company implementing the project will 
submit a long-term business strategy vision in the relevant field (e.g., a 10-year 
innovation plan or the formation of a team directly connected to top management) 
under the commitment of top management. Furthermore, the Government ask 
the managers themselves to clarify their commitment to persistently tackling the 
project as a critical business issue and to regularly participating in working groups 
- 99 - 
  
to explain their efforts and discuss progress of the project. The Government will 
then introduce mechanisms such as the cancellation of projects and the partial 
return of commissioning fees in the case of inadequate efforts as a critical 
business issue, and incentive measures in which the Government will increase 
its support depending on the degree of achievement of the target. 
By creating mechanisms to require a commitment from the top management, 
the Government's 2-trillion-yen budget will be used as pump priming to induce 
private companies to invest approximately 15 trillion yen in R&D and equipment, 
and to move toward ambitious innovation. It will also draw in ESG (environmental, 
social and governance) funds from around the world, which is estimated to be 
3,500 trillion yen, thereby generating income and employment by strengthening 
Japan's  industrial  competitiveness,  and  reducing  GHG  emissions  by 
implementing innovative technologies in society. 
 
Section 5: Tax systems 
 
Realization of the net-zero by 2050 is a high-set goal, and short-term capital 
investment by companies that is highly effective in achieving the goal needs to 
be encouraged, let alone R&D investment from long-term views. Therefore, also 
from  the  aspect  of  tax  systems,  the  Government  will  strongly  push 
decarbonization investment by companies. In view of this, the Government has 
taken the following measures in the FY2021 tax reform. 
  Establishing  tax  treatments  to  induce  private  investment  toward 
decarbonization in order to cultivate new demand through early marketing 
of products with large GHG reduction effect, or to promote decarbonization 
of production process currently in use.  
  Taking a special exception to raise the upper limit of tax deduction for loss 
carried  forward  targeting  companies  that  are  resolutely  taking  on 
challenges towards “new normal” and realization of carbon neutrality, even 
though their business is in the red, amid the severe business environment 
induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
  As  for  R&D  tax  systems,  strengthening  incentives  to  positive  R&D 
investment amid the COVID-19 crisis. 
These measures will strongly encourage enterprises to make every sort of 
short-, medium-, and long-term decarbonization investment. 
 
Section 6: Regulatory reform and standardization 
 
In the Action Plans in key industrial fields, the policy focus will be placed on 
the demand creation through regulatory reform and the price reduction through 
the expansion of private investment and standardization. 
- 100 - 
  
To this end, the Government strives to: 
  create demand for new technologies by strengthening regulations,  
  streamline regulations to accommodate new technologies,  
  make it easier for new technologies to be utilized through international 
standardization, etc. 
With these efforts, Japan will work on developing an institutional environment 
and  inter-regional  cooperation  in  both  domestic  and  international  domains, 
thereby  strengthening  its  international  competitiveness  and  facilitating 
autonomous expansion of its market. 
 
Section 7: Carbon Pricing 
 
Japan will, without hesitation, tackle economic instruments such as carbon 
pricing, which use market mechanisms and are conducive to growth, so as to 
strengthen industrial competitiveness and promote innovation and investment. 
In light of accelerated expansion of voluntary credit markets internationally, 
Japan will take concrete measures to increase the depth of the domestic market 
(credit market) in which carbon reduction value can be traded, and thereby 
promptly respond to the desires of companies that are pioneering climate change 
measures. 
Specifically, in light of the growing corporate demand for credits with carbon 
reduction value, such as J-Credits and Non-fossil Fuel Energy Certificates, at first 
the  Government  will  review  the  existing  credits  mechanisms  and  promote 
voluntary and market-based carbon pricing. 
Furthermore, in terms of carbon taxes and emissions trading systems, the 
Government will advance professional and technical discussions on whether it is 
possible to design a system that will promote investment and contribute to growth 
in terms of both price signaling and revenue generation, while taking into account 
the  added  cost  borne  by  companies.  In  doing  so,  Japan  will  build  upon 
international  trends  and  domestic  circumstance,  including  current  economic 
situation  and  the  availability  of  alternative  means,  efforts  of  leading  local 
governments,  and  possible  impact  on  the  international  competitiveness  of 
domestic industries. In addition, Japan will fully take the lead in creating fair 
international rules that strike a balance between free trade and climate change 
policies, while demonstrating its leadership as a standard-bearer for free trade. 
On this occasion, we will organize Japan’s basic approach to carbon border 
adjustment mechanism, and then respond strategically to such mechanisms by 
paying attention to the trends of discussions in the EU and other countries. 
   
- 101 - 
  
Section 8: Human Resource Development 
 
(1) Education 
 
In moving towards resolving the climate change issue, it is important to foster 
values through education and to continue practical actions that contribute to 
solutions. 
At  the  74th  United  Nations  General  Assembly  in  December  2019,  the 
international  promotion  framework  “Education  for  Sustainable  Development: 
Towards achieving the SDGs (ESD for 2030)” was adopted. It was decided to 
promote education that aims at realizing a sustainable society by bringing about 
a change in values and behaviors that will lead to solutions to various issues 
arising from human activities, such as climate change, by having each individual 
take the initiative to see these issues as their own and tackle them from their 
immediate surroundings. 
In Japan, the Liaison Conference on Education for Sustainable Development, 
which consists of 11 Ministries and Agencies, formulated the “Implementation 
Plan for ‘Education for Sustainable Development (ESD)’ in Japan (2nd National 
Implementation Plan)” (decided by the Liaison Conference on Education for 
Sustainable  Development  on  May  31,  2021)  in  May  2021  for  the  domestic 
development of ESD for 2030. Based on the plan, environmental education will 
be steadily promoted, keeping in mind the promotion of ESD and the harmony of 
the three aspects of economy, society, and environment. 
In particular, through activities at UNESCO schools and other schools, the 
Government will work to raise the awareness and interest of children, students, 
and teachers in environmental conservation and climate change issues, and to 
ensure the quality of UNESCO school activities and networks among schools. 
The  Government  will  also  promote  collaboration  between  schools  and 
communities,  and  encourage  community-wide  environmental  activities.  In 
addition,  the  Government  will  support  the  formation  of  multi-stakeholder 
partnerships in order to establish actions to solve the climate change issue 
throughout society. 
 
(2) Human Resource Development for Innovation 
 
In order to create sustained innovations for the virtuous cycle of the economy 
and the environment, and to promote just transition of the workforce smoothly, it 
is important that the Government develops and maintain human resources in a 
wide  range  of  fields,  starting  with  science  and  technology  that  relate  to 
environment and energy. In order to continue developing human resources for 
the future, the Government needs to be continuously engaged in human resource 
- 102 - 
  
development from a long-term perspective. As the issue of decarbonized society 
is of a global nature, the entire international community needs to make efforts 
together. In this context, it is important that Japan, renowned for high academic 
and  technological  standards,  develop  human  resources  to  lead  the  world 
decarbonization. 
Accordingly,  human  resource  development  for  comprehensive  R&D  from 
basic research to practical application in the fields of environment and energy will 
be conducted, including preparing necessary environment such as on-the-job 
training, aimed at educating young and capable researchers. 
In  business  management,  the  Government  will  facilitate  companies  to 
incorporate  perspectives  to  appropriately  address  environmental  issues  and 
create new corporate values. In this context, the Government will facilitate efforts 
of companies to develop human resources in and out of the company to be 
engaged in management emphasizing environment and environmental protection 
and lead a “green” socio-economic system -- environmental human resources. 
 
Section  9:  Enhancement  of  an  Integrated  Approach  in  Building  a  Resilient 
Society to Adapt to Climate Change 
 
In  responding  to  climate  change,  mitigation  and  adaptation  are 
complementary measures to each other. The Government will steadily promote 
climate change measures based on two laws and two plans, each relating to 
mitigation and adaptation. 
In particular, the promotion of measures that bring about positive effects on 
both  mitigation  and  adaptation  will  help  reduce  GHG  emissions  while 
simultaneously improving societal resilience. These measures will also bring 
many benefits, such as developing a sound local community and improving 
people’s  health, as  well  as  contributing  to addressing  the  synergy  between 
climate action and disaster risk reduction (DRR) where climate action and DRR 
will be advanced in an integrated manner. For example, the introduction of self-
sustained and distributed energy including renewable energy is a mitigation 
measure, and at the same time, helps revitalize the local economy and secures 
energy in the event of a disaster, thus beneficial for adaptation. Developing and 
disseminating technologies to streamline and conserve water use and increasing 
awareness on water conservation can also contribute to reducing CO  emissions 
2
by reducing the energy required for water supply and sewarage system treatment. 
In addition, Nature-based Solutions (NbS), such as green infrastructure which 
makes use of various functions of natural environment, and ecosystem-based 
- 103 - 
  
approaches including the one based on forest (EbA52 and Eco-DRR53) will have 
various advantageous effects, such as: adaptation to climate change such as 
DRR; mitigation of climate change through carbon storage; generation of various 
economic, social and cultural co-benefits in local communities; and contribution 
to conservation of biodiversity and its sustainable use. 
The type and scale of climate change impacts significantly vary by climate, 
geography,  socio-economic  conditions,  and  other  local  and  regional 
characteristics. The fields requiring urgent measures also differ depending on the 
local area and region. In light of the situation, the Government will continue to 
utilize a knowledge platform on climate change impacts and adaptation called 
Climate Change Adaptation Information Platform (A-PLAT) and DIAS, etc. to 
strengthen and improve knowledge by linking the databases of various ministries, 
agencies and research institutions and will provide information including that on 
climate risk in a practical format to be utilized by various entities. 
In addition, in order to promote business activities adapted to climate change 
the Government will enhance the awareness of business operators on adaptation 
and encourage taking measures accordingly by visualization, i.e., collecting and 
providing the best practices of business operators in and out of Japan on climate 
risk management, i.e., grasping climate risks associated with business activities 
and taking measures, and adaptation businesses which provide technologies, 
products and services on adaptation. 
For developing countries and island countries which are highly vulnerable to 
climate  change,  Japan  will  promote  observation,  monitoring,  projection  and 
evaluation of climate change and its impacts, and promote technical cooperation 
on climate change adaptation, such as in the fields of DRR and agriculture, by 
using various international cooperation schemes and meteorological satellites, as 
well as AP-PLAT which Japan established as an international sharing system for 
information  about  climate  change.  In  addition,  in  order  to  make  a  plan  to 
systematically cope with future climate change impacts according to the local 
conditions, Japan will promote the utilization of local universities and research 
institutes so that the results of research and technological development can be 
used. Furthermore, utilizing AP-PLAT and DIAS, etc., Japan will promote the 
international expansion of adaptation businesses of Japanese companies. In 
doing so, by making use of such knowledge as of disaster experience, DRR and 
environmental  technologies,  Japan  will  promote  overseas  expansion  and 
international cooperation by the public and private sectors.

Section 10: Central and local government’s Own Efforts to Lead the Society 
 
The central and local governments will lead the way in carrying out initiatives 
for decarbonization on its own administration and undertakings, while working for 
the comprehensive introduction to the entire society to create a decarbonized 
society. 
Regarding  the  buildings  and  lands  owned  by  the  national  and  local 
governments,  Japan  aims  by  2030  to  have  photovoltaic  power  generation 
equipment installed on approx. 50% of the buildings and other facilities where 
possible, followed by the installment on maximum number of those buildings and 
facilities by 2040. Japan also aims to have the public sector take the lead in 
procuring electricity from renewable energy sources. In addition, as for the public 
facilities such as government buildings, schools, and sanitation facilities including 
waste disposal, water supply and sewerage systems, decarbonization will be 
promoted from now on in their renewal or update through improvements in the 
energy  efficiency  performance,  introduction  of  renewable  energy  facilities, 
electrification, and fuel switching in their renewal, in order to achieve net-zero by 
2050, so that the infrastructure that emits GHGs will no longer exist 30 years later 
(to prevent lock-in). 
The Government will  contribute to make available the information of the 
budget on environmental protection, including climate change. 
 
Section 11: Enhancement of Scientific Knowledge 
 
The Working Group I contribution to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report 
released in August 2021 states that it is unequivocal that human influence has 
warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. On this basis, it is essential to continue 
to accumulate the latest scientific knowledge both from inside and outside Japan 
in order to promote climate change countermeasures from a long-term and global 
perspective. 
Further survey and research, including observation, need to be conducted on 
such  issues  as  further  unravelling  of  the  climate  change  mechanism, 
improvement in the accuracy of the projection and assessment of the adverse 
effects and risks; and it is important to furnish the system for these. For further 
unravelling of the climate change mechanism and improvement in the accuracy 
of the projection, the modeling and simulation technologies will be sophisticated, 
including the use of supercomputers, thereby improving the time and spatial 
resolution as well as reducing the uncertainty and generating data for climate 
change  projection,  including  the  likelihood  of  occurrence.  Japanese  climate 
change projection data based on the needs of each sector will be enhanced in 
addition, the Government will strategically support researches to unravel the 
- 105 - 
  
mechanisms of climate change and assess the environmental, economic and 
social impacts of climate change, aiming for international cooperation where 
appropriate. With regard to the observation and monitoring related to climate 
change, comprehensive observation and monitoring to keep track of the GHG, 
climate change, and their effects will be continued. The Government will continue 
to observe the GHG in particular on a global scale from the space with the 
Greenhouse  Gases  Observing  Satellite  (GOSAT).  GOSAT-2,  launched  in 
October 2018, is able to identify combustion origin of CO , and the observational 
2
results will help refine climate change projections, improve the transparency of 
emissions reporting in accordance with the Paris Agreement by the state parties, 
and contribute to the Paris Agreement including following how far each country 
has reached its targets in the global stock-take. 
Furthermore, the launch of the Global Observing SATellite for Greenhouse 
gases and Water cycle (GOSAT-GW), scheduled in FY2023, is expected to 
improve  the  ability  to  identify  GHG  emission  sources  and  the  accuracy  of 
emission estimates, while maintaining the current GHG observation system. This 
will contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement including the second 
global stocktake in 2028. Furthermore, with an eye on net-zero by 2050, Japan 
will  collect  information  necessary  to  study  methods  for  observing  GHG 
concentrations and estimating emissions in 2030 and beyond, and organize the 
strengths of Japan and the direction of future GHG observation methods that 
make the most of them. 
In addition to the observation from the satellites, the Government will continue 
its observation on land and with vessels and aircraft, summarizing and analyzing 
the resulting data to fill out the knowledge, and disseminating the findings both 
domestically and internationally. 
In particular, in terms of observation of the Arctic and Antarctic regions where 
the effects of climate change are most prominent including the rapid decrease in 
sea ice, Japan remains to be engaged in steady construction of Arctic research 
vessels and continuous observation of the Antarctic region, which will enrich 
scientific knowledge. At the same time, Japan will disseminate the obtained data 
both domestically and internationally, thereby contributing to the high-resolution 
and precision of climate change projection. To assess the negative impacts and 
risks of climate change, Japan will promote further utilization of GHG observation 
data through the Global Environment Information Platform. Taking advantage of 
these strengths, Japan will also promote international cooperation such as in the 
sharing of observations by year, region, gas type, observation method, etc.; the 
joint implementation of accuracy verification and intercomparison (cooperation 
between countries that conduct observations); and the utilization in the global 
stocktake (cooperation between countries that conduct observations and emitting 
countries).

Chapter 4: Review and Implementation of the Long-Term Strategy 
 
In relation to this Strategy, aiming for net-zero by 2050, the Government will 
carry out analyses, taking future situational changes into account, based on the 
best available scientific knowledge, on issues such as the constraints on land, 
climate, resources and social systems, opportunities for growth caused by climate 
change, economic effects including costs, the loss of not conducting climate 
change measures, and etc. Furthermore, the Government will widely disseminate 
the information that has been found, and promote further initiatives to achieve 
net-zero by 2050 by pursuing collaboration with the stakeholders and dialogue 
that include younger generations, who will uphold the society over the long term. 
 
Reflecting on the vision established in this strategy and taking into account 
the  Plan  for  Global  Warming  Countermeasures  (October  22,  2021,  cabinet 
decision) and the Strategic Energy Plan, the Government will flexibly revisit the 
policy measures referred to in this Strategy about every 6 years with reference to 
situations, and review this Strategy as may be required.
