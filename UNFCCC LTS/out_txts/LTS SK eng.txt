SUMMARY 
This Strategy aims to identify measures, including additional measures, to achieve climate 
neutrality in Slovakia by 2050. This ambitious target was formally defined only at the last 
stage of preparation for this Strategy  (after the completion of the modelling of possible 
emission scenarios), and therefore other less ambitious emission reduction (and increase in 
removals) scenarios are analysed in detail: a scenario with existing WEM measures and a 
scenario with additional WAM measures. These, however, as pointed out in the Strategy 
itself, are unlikely to bring Slovakia to a lower degree of climate neutrality without additional 
effort. Possible additional measures are proposed at the end of each sectoral chapter, marked 
NEUTRAL, and should be modelled in future strategy updates. 
 
An essential part of the vision is the horizon of the nearest strategic decade, which is crucial 
for the achievement of the 2030 climate and energy targets. Plus, an essential fact in the case 
of Slovakia is that, if additional measures are not implemented beyond those used in WEM 
and WAM models and scenarios, then Slovakia will not meet the climate neutrality target in 
2050. The projected emission gap is likely to be 14 MtCO , which accounts for an 80% 
2eq.
emissions reduction compared to 1990 (not taking into account removals in the LULUCF 
sector). The hardest and most expensive step will be to just eliminate this gap. The target 
emission gap should be 7MtCO2 . This amount is likely to be eliminated through removals. 
eq
Removals  are  developed  mainly  by  the  land  use,  land-use  change,  and  forestry  sector 
(LULUCF), which in the case of sustainable management has great potential to reduce CO  
2
emissions.  
If Slovakia decarbonises its economy as modelled in the scenario with additional WAM 
measures under the World Bank cooperation project (a 70% reduction in total emissions 
compared to 1990 under the World Bank conservative estimate), additional costs until 2030 
will be EUR 8 billion for the whole decade. From 2031 – 2050 (the next two decades) the 
expected costs will be EUR 196 billion over the WEM reference scenario. Thus, by 2040, 
average additional annual costs will be 1.8% of GDP, and in 2020-2050 will average 4.2% of 
GDP annually. 
 
However, Slovakia has the highest decarbonisation targets. It implies a reduction of at least 
90% compared to 1990 (not taking into account removals), which would mean achieving 
climate neutrality in 2050. Therefore, the cost of the most ambitious decarbonisation would 
also be significantly higher than that envisaged in this strategy. The models used did not rely 
on this scenario and it is one of the tasks for updating this strategy in the future, which will 
also take into account the forthcoming EU strategy on climate neutrality.  
 
In the medium term, according to internal estimates of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak 
Republic in cooperation with the Permanent Representation of the Slovak Republic to the EU 
and to MoE SR estimates, between EUR 9.9 billion and EUR 10.5 billion could be available 
for climate action until 2030 through the EU budget (this figure only includes the budget until 
6
 
    
2027), the Modernisation Fund and the Environmental Fund. This did not include other 
possible financial resources for potential projects drawn from the Innovation Fund and the 
forthcoming so-called Just Transition Mechanism, and also from the financial mechanism of 
the  European  Economic  Area  and  the  Norwegian  Financial  Mechanism.  Other  financial 
resources within the budget of the SR and the European budget between 2028 and 2030 were 
not taken into account. Thus, this figure exceeds the estimated additional cost of World Bank 
modelling by EUR 2.5 billion until 2030.  
 
In the medium term, according to internal estimates of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak 
Republic in cooperation with the Permanent Representation of the Slovak Republic to the EU, 
between 2027 and 2050, Slovakia will have EUR 42 to 45 billion available for measures to 
combat  climate  change  from the EU  budget  alone,  where  other  national  and  European 
resources are not taken into account.  
 
Within five years at the latest, this Strategy will be updated to reflect recent developments at 
the national and EU levels. Until such time, several  analytical tasks  need to be solved, 
including: modelling the scope of  reductions and the impact  of the  additional measures 
identified as NEUTRAL in the Strategy. It will also be necessary to update the WEM and 
WAM reduction scenarios to reflect the current political and legal situation. The readiness of 
state and public authorities to use increasing funding for decarbonisation projects in the long 
term should also be analysed during the update of this Strategy. In addition, an open question 
at the EU level remains addressing the measures to maintain the competitiveness of EU 
exporters to third countries. 
 
In the meantime, in an effort to move closer to Slovakia’s common goal of achieving climate 
neutrality by 2050, all measures identified in the WEM and WAM scenarios will need to be 
implemented horizontally across all sectors and other additional NEUTRAL measures will 
need to be launched and implemented. All identified emission sectors will have to contribute 
to this effort jointly because, as described in the individual chapters for each sector, some 
reduction efforts will have to be increased, especially where emissions have not declined for 
the last decade and the trend must be reversed (transport, agriculture), or it is necessary to 
achieve the national ETS target by 2030, or the total modelled emissions in these sectors are 
higher than the target emission gap that can be emitted in 2050 (the energy sector without 
transport and industrial process emissions), or it is necessary to reverse the trend of declining 
removals in the long term in the specific LULUCF sector.  
 
Consistent horizontal implementation of measures that are in line with the target of achieving 
climate neutrality in the middle of this century and at the same time in line with this Strategy 
is to be ensured by the Council of the Government of the Slovak Republic for the European 
Green  Deal  and  Low-Carbon  Transformation.  This  horizontal  coordinating  body  at  the 
highest  level  will  be  approved  together  with  this  Strategy  as  a  sign  that  low-carbon 
transformation in Slovakia is taken seriously.

1  OVERVIEW AND PREPARATION OF THE STRATEGY 
1.1  Introduction 
The aim of the “ Low – Carbon Development Strategy of the Slovak Republic until 2030 with 
a View to 2050“  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Strategy)  is  to  outline  options  for  a 
comprehensive long-term (30-year) strategic roadmap for moving to a low-carbon economy, 
which will be completed by achieving climate neutrality by 2050. The Strategy identifies key 
policies and measures that will lead to achieving the headline target of the Paris Agreement1 – 
keeping the increase in global temperature this century to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts 
to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. According to the targets 
of  the  Paris  Agreement,  the  EU  and  Slovakia  have  committed  themselves2  to  climate 
neutrality by 2050, which means that only as much greenhouse gas emissions as we can 
remove can be emitted. The European Commission is further ahead in this process, as they 
already presented its detailed roadmap as early as on 11 December 2019 on key policies and 
measures  with  the objective  of  climate  neutrality,  entitled  the  European  Green  Deal.  In 
Slovakia, such a low-carbon transformation will on the one hand bring new additional costs, 
which were partially quantified in Chapter 4 (Impact Assessment) at 1.8 – 4.2% of the GDP 
per year. On the other hand, such a transformation will bring about environmental, economic 
and health benefits and development of a sustainable low-carbon economy. These costs must 
also be seen as investments for the future because climate change presents an enormous 
destructive potential that can jeopardize the functioning of the state and society with the 
standards we are used to today. For example, according to EEA estimates, between 1980 and 
2017 Slovakia reached economic losses from the extremes of climate change in the amount of 
almost EUR 1.7 billion.3 If no additional measures are taken and the global temperature rises 
by 3.5°C (everything is moving towards this now), then in the future the losses in the EU in 
the social security of the country would account for 1.8% of GDP4 and total loses for the EU 
would represent EUR 190 billion5. 
The low-carbon strategy aims to select and analyse cost-effective measures in terms of the 
scope of emission reductions and the economic and social impact. The measures envisaged in 
the near future and detailed and modelled in the strategy under the WEM and WAM scenarios 
raised the fact that climate neutrality in Slovakia cannot be achieved by 2050 with them. 
Therefore, the strategy also includes additional measures (called NEUTRAL) which should 
move Slovakia closer to its goal by 2050. Whether this happens will be analysed in detail in

the near future as part of the updating process. The implementation of the measures will 
require the active involvement of the relevant sectors, the interconnection and consolidation 
of  individual  sectoral  and  cross-cutting  policies,  and  society-wide  engagement. 
Consistent horizontal implementation of measures that are in harmony with the objective of 
achieving climate neutrality by the middle of this century and in line with this strategy is to be 
ensured by the Council of the Government of the Slovak Republic for the European Green 
Deal and Low-Carbon Transformation, the adoption of which is expected together with this 
Strategy. 
1.2  Legal and Political Context 
1.2.1   European Political Context 
In October 2014, the European Council adopted the 2030 climate and energy framework 
which  contains,  inter  alia,  a  binding  EU  target  of  at  least 40%  fewer  greenhouse  gas 
emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. The EU has set such a target collectively (and 
hence Slovakia) as their reduction target under the Paris Climate Agreement6. Based on this 
framework, the entire EU climate and energy legislation was subject to a comprehensive 
review in the next few years.  
On 28 November 2018, the European Commission (“the EC”) published a communication 
entitled “A Clean Planet for all; A European strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, 
modern,  competitive  and  climate  neutral  economy”.  The  document  analyses  possible 
pathways to a low-carbon economy that would meet the European Union's (EU) ambitious 
greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets or lead to climate neutrality by the end of the first 
half of this century. In this context, eight scenarios have been analysed, of which the two most 
ambitious scenarios would achieve a 100% reduction in emissions (after taking into account 
negative emissions, i.e. removals), which would mean achieving climate neutrality as early as 
2050. These two scenarios are in line with the ambitious 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement. 
The areas and measures described in the communication are of a cross-cutting nature. Energy 
plays a central role, but all sectors will have to take up their part to achieve GHG reduction 
objectives. This will be mean the industrial and transport sectors, but also the building, 
agriculture and waste management sectors. The circular economy and forestry system will 
also  play  an  important  role.  Achieving  climate  neutrality  will  also  require  a  change  in 
consumer behaviour. 
In December 2019,7 the European Council endorsed the objective of a climate neutral EU by 
2050, with some MS (Sweden, Finland, Austria) choosing even more ambitious targets at the 
national level. Slovakia signed up to a text that referred to climate neutrality in June 2019. In 
December 2019, the European Commission presented its detailed roadmap on key policies 
and  measures  for  achieving  climate  neutrality,  called  the  European  Green  Deal8.  This

agreement  became  the  basic  programming  document  of  the  whole  EC.  The  agreement 
includes measures and a roadmap of key policies covering a wide range of issues - from 
ambitiously  cutting  emissions,  to  investing  in  cutting-edge  research  and  innovation, 
transforming the entire industry, economy and agriculture, to preserving Europe’s natural 
environment. Under the agreement, the above stated -40% reduction target for the EU by 
2030 is to be reviewed (the EC proposes a -50% to -55% target).   
 
 
1.2.2  Slovak Political Context 
In response to the climate and environmental challenges and recent political developments at 
the European level, and given the major influence of the European Green Deal based on 
which the European Commission has already launched new initiatives, it is desirable to set up 
horizontal cross-sectoral coordination in Slovakia as soon as possible with the involvement of 
the political level. Therefore, together with the adoption of this Strategy, it is proposed to 
create  a  coordinating  and  consultative  advisory  body  to  the  Government  of  the  Slovak 
Republic entitled the Council of the Government of the Slovak Republic for the European 
Green Deal and Low-Carbon Transformation.  
1.2.3  Legal Framework for the Preparation of the Strategy 
The obligation to develop this Strategy is based on international, European and Slovak law. 
According to the Paris Climate Agreement, all parties, including the EU, are obliged to 
develop and submit by 2020 at the latest their long-term low-emission development strategies 
to take effect by 2050.  
 
This obligation has also been transformed into EU law, namely Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of 
the European Parliament and of the Council on the Governance of the Energy Union and 
Climate Action9, adopted in 2018. According to Article 15 of the Regulation, MS are obliged 
to submit a long-term low emission strategy by 1 January 2020. Annex IV to the Regulation 
specifies the content of the national strategies, which this strategy follows.  
 
The obligation to prepare a Low-Carbon Development Strategy of the Slovak Republic also 
results  from  the  performance  of  the  tasks  of  the  Action  Plan of  the National  Reform 
Programme 201310. This priority has also been set by the Government of the SR in the 
Programme Statement of the Government of the Slovak Republic for 2016-2020, according to 
which  “the  MoE  is  obliged  prepare  a 2050  Low-Carbon  Strategy”,  which  identifies  the 
potential for cost-effective emission reductions in individual sectors of the economy.

1.2.4  Procedural Steps of Document Preparation 
Background and Reasons for Document Preparation 
Slovakia meets the set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which have dropped by 
almost half since 1990 (taking into account the removals). This can be attributed to economic 
transformation, more efficient production processes and the introduction of new technologies 
(BAT technologies).  
Initially,  emissions  in  the  SR  were  reduced  through  relatively  simple  and  inexpensive 
measures (e.g., switching from coal to gas, closing inefficient and polluting operations as part 
of company restructuring and the introduction of market principles). Such changes were also 
related to Slovakia’s EU membership. However, cheaper measures are now largely exhausted 
and further emission abatement will require high investment costs.  
These costs can also be understood as investments for the future because climate change 
presents enormous destructive potential that can jeopardize the functioning of the state and 
society in  the future with  regard to  the standards we are used to  today.  In Slovakia,  a 
temperature increase of 1.73°C was observed for the period of 1881 – 2017. Changes are also 
indicated by trends in atmospheric precipitation, where in the south of Slovakia a drop of 
more than 10% was observed, but in the north and northeast total precipitation grew to 3% 
in isolated cases. Over the past 15 years, there has been a significant growth in the occurrence 
of extreme daily and several-day rainfall totals, which has resulted in an increase in the risk of 
local floods in various areas of the Slovak Republic. On the other hand, from 1989 – 2017 
there was local or full-area drought much more often than before, which mainly resulted from 
long periods of relatively warm weather with low total precipitation in some part of the 
vegetation period. The drought was particularly significant in 1990 – 1994, 2000, 2002, 2003 
and 2007; in some regions in the west of Slovakia also in 2015 and 2017. There is also 
evidence of gradual desertification, especially in the south of the country.  
The  purpose  of  this  long-term  Strategy  is  to  present  measures  required  for  reducing 
greenhouse emissions and to present a vision that can lead to establishing a balance between 
greenhouse gas emissions and their removals by 2050 in a cost-effective manner. Another 
positive aspect of the transformation is the fact that it will also bring new environmental, 
economic and health benefits and the development of a sustainable low-carbon economy. 
Selecting individual measures so that the selection is based on cost-effectiveness principles 
and finding out how these measures will influence emission abatement and the national 
economy is a rather complicated task. For this reason, the MoE SR signed an Agreement on 
Cooperation with the WB in November 2016. The cooperation project with the WB resulted 
in a Low-Carbon Growth Study for Slovakia: Implementing the EU 2030 Climate and Energy 
Policy Framework (with an outlook to the year 2050)11. This Low-Carbon Growth Study was 
the  basis  for  the  development  of  the  Low-Carbon  Development  Strategy  of  the  Slovak

Republic. The Low-Carbon Strategy was prepared with two models. The first one was the 
CPS model Slovakia from the WB (mainly related to the energy sector, industry and transport, 
i.e. those in which fuel is burned), the other one was a macro model – ENVISAGE-Slovakia 
(CGE). The two models were applied in a coordinated fashion, with the CPS model providing 
detailed energy outputs to the CGE model. Using them, WB experts, in cooperation with 
national experts, modelled the macroeconomic effects of individual proposed policies and 
measures in sectors where emissions from fuel combustion (energy, including transport) arise. 
Other sectors such as industrial emissions, fugitive emissions, LULUCF, agriculture, waste 
management and transport were modelled into scenarios by an expert approach, also based on 
the measures used by the WB. The COPERT model was also used in the transport sector. 
More detailed information on the models as well as on the approach to each sector is provided 
in Annex II.   
Following  the  preparatory  work  on  the  low-carbon  strategy,  the  MoE  SR  published  a 
questionnaire in May 2018 which was intended for the general professional public and a link 
to the questionnaire was presented in professional media and on the Ministry’s website. The 
questionnaire is available together with the evaluation on the MoE website12.  
The Low-Carbon Strategy covers the following sectors of economic activity: industry, the 
energy sector and energy efficiency, agriculture, LULUCF, transport and waste management 
including macroeconomic analyses and impacts of selected proposed measures. The Low-
Carbon Strategy aims at selecting and analysing measures in a cost-effective way. Support of 
the relevant departments and the interconnection and consolidation of individual sectoral and 
cross-sectoral policies will be necessary for its implementation. 
In August 2018, an “ad hoc working group on the preparation of a low-carbon strategy” was 
established (Figure 1), composed of representatives of the state administration as well as 
representatives of academia and employers’ associations. The basis of the working group was 
the already existing working group for the preparation of the Low-Carbon Strategy, which 
had been set up under the Commission for the Coordination of Climate Change Policy at the 
level of State Secretaries. In addition to this working group, six working groups set up by 
individual sectors began operating in November 2018.

When preparing the document, the MoE SR relied on, among other documents and materials, 
the “Methodology and Institutional Framework for the Creation of Public Strategies”, which 
was adopted by the Slovak Government by Government Decree No. 197 of 26 April 2017.  
 
In the context of this document, the concepts of carbon neutrality and climate neutrality are 
interchangeable and both mean that by 2050 a balance will be reached between greenhouse 
gas emissions from anthropogenic activity and the removals of emissions, which are mainly 
forests in our country. 
Link to Strategic Environmental Assessment 
Given  the  strategic  nature  and  nationwide  impact,  the  material  is  subject  to  a  strategic 
environmental impact assessment, including human health impacts (SEA) under Act No. 
24/2006 Coll. on Environmental Impact Assessments and on amendments and supplements to 
certain acts.13 
 
Document Management and Updating 
Following their strategic documents, the MoE SR, in close cooperation with other materially 
competent departments, will be responsible for managing, coordinating and updating the 
Strategy every five years.  
 
                                                 
13 The purpose of implementing the SEA process is to ensure a high level of environmental protection and to contribute to 
the integration of environmental aspects into the preparation and adoption of an economic policy strategy with a view to 
promoting sustainable development.

Document Structure  
The Strategy is divided into several parts. The introduction briefly describes the legal and 
political framework and the overall context on which the need for this Strategy is based. 
Furthermore, the Strategy describes the structure of sectors and greenhouse gas emissions in 
Slovakia  and  the  current  trends  in  their  reduction  and  reduction  targets  for  the  future, 
including possible future reduction trends. The main part of the Strategy consists of individual 
sectors in this order: the energy sector including transport and fugitive emissions, emissions 
from ‘Industrial  processes’,  transport,  agriculture, the  LULUCF  sector  and  waste 
management. Within these sectors, the current state of emission reductions and modelled 
scenarios of emission reductions until 2050 or 2040 are described by the WEM reference 
scenario and the scenario 'with additional measures' (WAM). At the end of each sector, 
additional measures are outlined (marked as NEUTRAL) which have not yet been modelled 
and which should help to achieve climate neutrality in Slovakia by 2050. The final chapters 
deal with the economic and social effects of the measures that have been modelled in WAM 
scenarios. At the end of the Strategy, there are Annexes I and II, which provide a detailed 
description of the scenarios by sector and a description of analytical models and procedures 
used.  
 
 
1.3  Public Consultation  
Due to the  complexity  and  cross-sectional  content  of  society-wide  impact,  the  MoE  SR 
cooperated  with  other  relevant  departments  as  well  as  representatives  of  the  general 
professional public and academia in the preparation of the Low-Carbon Strategy. During its 
preparation, the document will also be consulted with the relevant sections and organizations 
within the remit of the Ministry. The Ministry declared its interest in preparing the Strategy in 
May  2018  via  a  publicly  accessible  questionnaire  through  which  both  the  general  and 
professional  public  could  enter  and  directly  participate  in  the  proposal  of  characteristic 
measures in the individual chapters proposed. All responses have been assessed and processed 
and, if a respondent agreed with publication, they were published on the Ministry’s website14  
together  with  a  textual  evaluation  of  the  entire  questionnaire.  The  public  also  had  the 
opportunity to join and participate in the preparation of the document in the Interdepartmental 
Comments Procedure process.  
Finally, the public will also have the opportunity to join and participate in the preparation of 
the document in the SEA process.

2  CONTENT OF THE STRATEGY 
2.1  Overall Emission Reductions and Enhancement of Removals up to 2050  
2.1.1  Planned Emission Reductions and Enhancement of Removals up to 2050  
 
Based on the WB’s energy and macroeconomic modelling summarized in the Low-Carbon 
Growth Study (energy sectors such as households, industry, energy and fuel combustion 
services) and the national projections and expert estimates (non-fuel sectors), it can be 
assumed that Slovakia could reduce emissions by 2050 (compared to 1990) by a maximum 
of 80% (without removals in the LULUCF sector) if all additional modelled measures are 
implemented.  If  maximum  possible  removals  from  the  LULUCF  sector  are  taken  into 
account, a maximum of 90% emission reductions compared to 1990 could be envisaged, 
which would still not be sufficient to meet the objective of achieving climate neutrality. 
By 2050 there would still be at least 14 MtCO eq. without counting removals in LULUCF 
2
(Figure 2) and after counting removals, it would be at least 7 MtCO eq.

The 80% or 90% drop is not automatic and will require investment and changes in the 
economy and population behaviour. This is also highlighted by the WEM reference scenario 
15
 
    
(Figure 3), in which all emission reductions are modelled only if the measures in force at the 
time of modelling (2016-2018) are implemented. This scenario shows that without additional 
measures, we are at risk that emissions in 2050 will remain at a level comparable to 2015.

The total reduction was calculated on the basis of the results of CGE and CPS models as well 
as expert estimates and SHMI projections, which were more optimistic than conservative 
modelling by the WB. In its models, the WB focused mainly on CO  emissions from energy 
2
(fuel combustion), where in 'with additional measures' WAM scenarios, they even modelled a 
65%  reduction  (Figure  4)  compared  to  2015,  while  emissions  other  than  from  fuel 
combustion (mainly industrial processes, fugitive emissions, waste, agriculture) were at a 
higher level (14 MtCO eq.) than in 2015 (10 MtCO eq.) in the 2050 scenario (Figure 5). It 
2 2
appears to us that the WB addressed these non-energy emissions very conservatively and did 
not take into account potential reductions due to additional WAM measures. For this reason, 
too, the WB in the resulting model yielded an overall emission reduction by less than 70% by 
2050  compared  to  1990  levels  (without LULUCF  removals),  which  would  represent  an 
emission of 23 MtCO eq. in 2050.

Note: All emissions are total greenhouse gas emissions without LULUCF. The grey bars are taken from the 
energy model, i.e. they represent not only the energy and industry sectors, but also other consumer sectors – 
households, transport, services. 
 
However, expert estimates and partial projections of SHMI in these non-energy sectors (only 
by 2040) show other trends thanks to which a reduction of more than 50% could be achieved 
in these non-energy sectors as well. This trend is also supported by the results of the WB 
modelling, according to which all emissions from non-ETS sectors will drop by 29%15 by 
2050 compared to the reference scenario (these emissions account for less than a half of non-
energy emissions) and all ETS emissions will drop by 55%16 by 2050 compared to the 
reference  scenario  (more  than  a half  of  non-energy  emissions).  The  adoption  of  more 
ambitious energy legislation in the EU, which has also been reflected in the Slovak targets 
through the NECP compared to those envisaged in the model, can shift expectations towards a 
more optimistic scenario. Also, the model did not foresee ambitious EC plans for 2020 – 2025 
(the European Green Deal). The Slovak Government also adopted a decision on the early 
termination of support for electricity production from domestic coal and a commitment to 
achieve climate neutrality, which was also not considered in the model. It is precisely the 
commitment of the Slovak Republic and the EU to achieve climate neutrality in 2050 that is 
essential in this context, as this will mean a revision of the energy and climate targets by 2030 
so that they are in line with this objective (increasing the ambition).  
For Slovakia, despite all the above stated arguments and approaches, the key fact is that it is 
clear that unless further additional measures are taken beyond those used in the WEM 
and WAM models and scenarios, Slovakia will have to deal with an emissions gap (the 
so-called gap) which will probably be 7 - 14 Mt CO . The hardest and most expensive 
2eq
thing will be to eliminate this gap. The target emission gap should be 7Mt CO ., as this is 
2eq
the amount that can potentially be eliminated through removals (the LULUCF sector).  
The strategy aims to identify all measures, including additional ones, in order to achieve 
climate neutrality in the SR, which in practice will mean issuing a maximum amount of 
emissions that will not exceed the above stated emission gap in 2050. Other possible 
additional measures are identified as NEUTRAL at the end of each sectoral chapter and 
should  go  beyond  the  already  modelled  measures  used  in  the  WEM  and  WAM 
scenarios.  These  additional  NEUTRAL  measures  and  their  impact  have  not  yet  been 
modelled in the study or strategy and this will be a task that will need to be addressed so that 
they will be part of the strategy at its next update (the adoption of an updated strategy within 
five years at the latest). In the meantime, it will also be important that these additional 
measures facilitating climate neutrality become part of the policies and priorities of other 
relevant sectors.

2.1.2  National Target by 2030 and Indicative Milestones up to 2040 and 2050 
This chapter describes in detail the EU targets, national targets and targets that were used for 
modelling purposes in the two scenarios of this strategy (WEM and WAM) as well as the 
reductions reached (total and partial for ETS and non-ETS sectors) (Table 1).

Notes 1 and 2: The national targets were set in the Envirostrategy 2030 adopted in February 
2019 
National targets up to 2030 are based on European targets and for the overall reduction target 
it is a collective EU-wide target where Slovakia has no national target.  
The European targets were set by the EU 2030 Climate and Energy Policy Framework, 
adopted  by  the  European  Council  in  October  2014.  For  more  details  see  Chapter  1.2.1 
(European Political Context).  
According to the scenario with additional measures (WAM), Slovakia should achieve a -47% 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. 
19
 
    
In  the  context  of  climate  policies,  the  basic  legislative  instruments  are  the  Directive 
introducing the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading17 within the Union 
(EU ETS) and the Regulation on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by 
Member  States  from  2021  to  2030  for  economic  sectors  of  the  economy  falling 
outside the scope of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme18 (ESR). 
Within the EU ETS, the covered sectors, which account for about 45% of EU emissions, must 
reduce  their  emissions  by  43%  by  2030  compared  to  2005.  According  to  the  2030 
Envirostrategy, Slovakia has also set the target as its national target for ETS. The high 
emission intensity of the Slovak economy suggests that the cost of economic adjustment for 
energy-intensive sectors is likely to be high, but the intensity may also indicate that the 
country  has  great  potential  for  cost-effective  emission  reductions  (if  adequate  and  well-
targeted policies and investments exist). According to scenarios with additional measures 
(WAM) resulting from WB modelling, a reduction of CO  emissions by 53.46% should be 
2
achieved in the EU ETS in 2030 compared to 2005 levels. According to scenarios with 
additional measures (WAM) modelled in the SHMI, the ETS should achieve reductions of 
total emissions by 40.5% in 2030 compared to 2005. Thus, additional efforts beyond the 
measures in the WAM scenarios are envisaged on the Slovak side to meet the national 
emission reduction target in the ETS sector. 
Then there are targets outside the ETS (ESR). Emissions from EU non-ETS sectors must be 
collectively reduced by around 30 per cent below the level of 2005. Individual targets within 
the ESR range from a zero change in emissions in Bulgaria to -40% in Sweden. Slovakia, 
despite its good economic condition in recent years, is likely to exceed its non-ETS target for 
2020 by several per centage points. This is one of the reasons why Slovakia has increased its 
target (-12%) for reducing non-ETS greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (enshrined in EU 
legislation) in its 2030 Envirostrategy to a more ambitious target of -20%. According to 
scenarios with additional measures (WAM) resulting from WB modelling, a reduction of EU 
non-ETS  GHG  emissions  by  2030  of  19.42%  should  be  achieved  compared  to  2005. 
According  to  scenarios  with  additional  measures  (WAM)  modelled  in  the  SHMI,  the 
reductions in total emissions of non-ETS sectors should be 30.5% in 2030 compared to 2005 
levels.  It is  important to note that based on the  modelling in the WEM Reference 
Scenario by the WB, emission reductions in non-ETS sectors will not be achieved, as 
emissions by model will grow by 2030 (similarly by 2050) compared to 2005.  
In the energy sector, the Directives for energy efficiency and renewable sources have been 
revised. Both Directives only adopted binding targets at the EU level (32.2% and 32% 
respectively), with each MS setting its national targets in its National Energy and Climate 
Plans. Based on the adopted energy legislation (based on the EU 2030 Climate and Energy 
Policy Framework), the Slovak Republic has chosen its targets for energy efficiency (30.3%) 
                                                 
17 Directive (EU) 2018/410 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2018 amending Directive 2003/87/EC 
to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments, and Decision (EU) 2015/1814 
18 Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on binding annual greenhouse 
gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments under 
the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 
20
 
    
and renewable sources (19.2%) including related policies and measures (PAMs) that would 
stimulate the achievement of these targets. These targets were described in more detail in the 
Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of Slovakia by 2030 (hereinafter the NECP)19. 
Slovakia has not set any indicative milestones until 2040 and all scenarios contained in this 
Strategy  that  are  modelled  only  for  the  final  2040  year  will  have  to  be  updated  and 
supplemented by 2050 as part of the update of this Strategy.  
An indicative milestone up to 2050, achieving climate neutrality in Slovakia by 2050, is 
set as an objective of this Strategy. This target will be enshrined in European law in 2020 
(the EC will propose this within the framework of the European Green Deal).  
The measures envisaged in the near future and detailed and modelled in the strategy under the 
WEM and WAM scenarios have raised the fact that climate neutrality in Slovakia cannot be 
achieved with them by 2050. Therefore, the strategy also includes additional measures 
(called  NEUTRAL)  which  should  help  Slovakia  achieve the objective  of  climate 
neutrality. Whether this happens will be analysed in detail later as part of its updating 
process.

2.2  Adaptation Policies and Measures 
The  first  comprehensive  document  providing  basic  strategic  guidance  for  Slovakia’s 
adaptation to climate change and giving examples of proactive adaptation measures is the 
Adaptation Strategy of the Slovak Republic on Adverse Impacts of Climate Change 
(NAS) of 2014, which was updated in 2018.20  
The strategy assesses the current state of adaptation and planned activities in key areas and 
sectors, defines a general vision of adaptation of selected areas and sectors, and a set of 
adaptation measures and a framework for their implementation. It examines the consequences 
of climate change and proposes adaptation measures in several sectors. It proposes priority 
actions, an institutional framework for the coordination and implementation of adaptation 
activities, as well as a proposal for monitoring and evaluation, and identifies potential sources 
of funding.  
The main objective of the updated National Adaptation Strategy is to improve Slovakia’s 
readiness to face the adverse effects of climate change, to provide broad information on 
current adaptation processes in Slovakia, and to establish an institutional framework and 
coordination mechanism to ensure effective implementation of adaptation measures at all 
levels and in all areas; and to raise overall awareness of this issue. 
The achievement of the main objective of adaptation should occur thanks to a contribution of 
the  partial  objectives,  namely:  ensuring  the  active  development  of  a  national  adaptation 
policy, implementing adaptation measures and monitoring their effectiveness, strengthening 
the projection of objectives and recommendations of the Adaptation Strategy in multilevel 
governance and business promotion, raising public awareness on climate change, promoting 
synergies between adaptation and mitigation measures and the use of the ecosystem approach 
in the implementation of adaptation measures, and promoting the projection of the objectives 
and recommendations of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. 
Adaptation measures will be further assessed and prioritized in the National Adaptation 
Action Plan, which is currently at the stage of preparation. Prioritization will be based on the 
results of the participative process, in which all relevant actors are involved. Short-term 
measures for the period 2020-2022 and medium-term ones for the period 2022-2025 will be 
identified. The Action Plan should contribute to better translating adaptation measures into the 
sectoral policies of the relevant sectors. At the same time, it should contain a proposal for a 
system of medium-term evaluation of the adaptation process in the conditions of Slovakia, 
including monitoring the linkages between costs and benefits, and a proposal for a platform 
for the publication and sharing of positive experience.

2.3  Energy from Renewable Sources 
A binding EU-wide target for the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final 
consumption of energy  is at  least  32% in  2030.  In order to  achieve this binding target, 
Member States’ contributions for 2030 to this target, from 2021, are in line with the indicative 
trajectory of this contribution. Slovakia’s contribution is 19.2% (which represents the de facto 
renewable energy target for Slovakia for 2030). 
This  already  includes  the  14%  RES  target  in  the  transport.  An  indicative  trajectory  is 
described in Table 2. More detailed information on RES (to determine the contribution, the 
estimated installed capacity of RES installations, the estimated amount of energy generated 
from renewable energy sources, as well as heat and cold production) is published in Chapter 
2.1.2. (Energy from RES) in the NECP. This plan was prepared by the Ministry of Economy 
in close cooperation with other relevant ministries (MoE SR, the Ministry of Transport and 
Construction of the Slovak Republic, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of 
the SR, the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR, MF SR) and other 
public and private sector stakeholders.

2.3.1  Biomass as a Renewable Energy Source 
According to the approved Energy Policy of the Slovak Republic,21 biomass has the largest 
energy potential among RES in Slovakia, with theoretical potential of 120 PJ. In addition, 
biomass has long been established not only in Slovakia as being the most important renewable 
energy  source,  the  use  of  which  contributes  to  increasing  the  energy  self-sufficiency  of 
countries, to economic growth and also significantly contributes to reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. According to the forecast, a slight growth in biomass is expected in Slovakia, 
mainly for energy purposes (cogeneration of electricity and heat and production of heat and 
cold), namely an increase in 2020 in wood chips from 3,160 tonnes to 3,540 tonnes in 2030, 
which represents an increase of 12% (Table 20 in the NECP). However, an increase in the 
total annual volume of planned felling is not expected, as the volume of incidental felling is 
included in the volume of planned felling carried out and the volume of planned felling cannot 
be exceeded. More detailed information on the current development and forecasts of forest

biomass trends, which is the most important part of biomass in Slovakia, can be found in the 
Green Report 201822 and in the National Forest Inventory and Monitoring of the Slovak 
Republic 2015-201623. 
 
2.4  Energy Efficiency  
Energy efficiency is one of the main pillars of the energy policy of the Slovak Republic. In its 
NECP, Slovakia has set its national contribution (which will mean Slovakia’s target) in the 
field of energy efficiency at 30.3% by 2030, which is below the European target of 32.5%. 
Slovakia has set its target based on the WB modelling in the Low-Carbon Growth Study, 
based on which two national contributions for energy efficiency have been set – a realistic 
28.36% and an ambitious 30.3. The SR has chosen the more ambitious one of 30.3% in its 
plan (please see Table 3). The industry and building sectors will be key to achieving this 
target. More detailed information on the energy efficiency sector (indicative trajectories, 
cumulative energy savings, etc.) is published in Chapter 2.2. in the NECP.

2.5  Detailed Analysis of Individual Sectors 
 
The individual chapters are broken down by IPCC sector and provide information on the most 
important  policies  and  measures  aimed  at  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  2050 
compared to the base year 2015 or 2017. The measures are divided into three groups in 
individual chapters: 
1. into measures already implemented (within the WEM scenario); 
2. into measures that will be implemented on the basis of new legislation, measures 
that are already in force and are not yet being implemented, or that have a high 
chance of being adopted (under the WAM scenario);  
3. Finally, into those that are not yet actually envisaged, but which in the future will 
need  to  be  adopted  and  implemented  in  a  cost-effective  way  to  achieve  the 
desired  environmental  benefits  so  as  to  achieve  climate  neutrality  by  2050 
(hereinafter referred to as other additional measures - NEUTRAL). 
Where possible, two scenarios with emission reductions are modelled in individual chapters 
by 2050 (based on WB models), somewhere only until 2040 (based on an expert approach - 
SHMI modelling).  
 
Two projection scenarios were used: 
  With existing measures (WEM);  
  With additional measures (WAM).  
 
Within these projections, the modelling included policies and legislation that no longer 
takes into account the real state of affairs at the time this Strategy was finalized. The 
most striking changes were in the adopted European energy legislation (higher EU targets for 
RES  and  energy  efficiency),  but  then  there  are  other  changes  (an  EU  waste  legislation 
package)  and  ambitious  plans  of  the  new  EC  which  are  more  likely  to  be  reflected  in 
European legislation in the near future. In addition, the national legislation has changed (more 
ambitious legislation on waste recycling, forest protection, more ambitious plans to terminate 
support for the production of electricity from domestic coal and more ambitious national 
contributions (targets) of the SR for RES and energy efficiency in the NECP than those 
originally envisaged). All these new and valid (probably valid) measures as mentioned above 
will have a positive impact on the future reduction of emissions in Slovakia. 
In addition to modelling the missing years of 2040 - 2050, another important task in 
updating  the  strategy  will  be  to  model  the  impact  of  other  additional  measures 
(NEUTRAL) which are stated at the end of each sectoral chapter and have not been 
modelled, and which should facilitate Slovakia’s climate neutrality in 2050. Whether 
these  additional  NEUTRAL  measures  will  indeed  contribute  to  achieving  climate 
neutrality or whether the adoption of other, more ambitious ones will be needed will 
only be seen from future modelling (with respect to updating this strategy) and the 
development of technology and policies which have recently become very dynamic.

2.5.1  ENERGY SECTOR (INCLUDING TRANSPORT AND FUGITIVE 
EMISSIONS) 
2.5.1.1 Current Trends in Reducing Emissions in the Energy Sector   
This sector includes the transport sub-sector and transport emissions, and these emissions and 
transport measures have also been included in the models and projections used in the energy 
sector; for ease of reference, all transport sector measures are described in a separate chapter 
below (the transport sector). The fugitive emissions sector is part of the energy sector, but 
since it does not burn any fuels, the sector was not included in the models. Therefore, 
projections have been made separately for it and are part of this chapter. 
The energy sector is the main contributor to total greenhouse gas emissions with a share of 
67.04% and 27,543.77 Gg CO  eq. in 2016. The trend of total fossil fuel consumption is 
2
decreasing  as  a  result  of  higher  energy  efficiency  (Figure  6).  By  comparison,  biomass 
consumption was 3.6 times higher in 2015 than in 1990. Within this sector, the main polluters 
include transport, with a share of 24.5%, fuel consumption in large (a 27.4% share) and 
medium-sized stationary sources (a 24.6% share), pollution from small sources of residential 
heating  systems  (a  17.4%  share)  and  fugitive  emissions  of  methane  from 
transmission/transport/distribution, processing and storage of oil and natural gas (a 6.4% 
share). 27

2.5.1.2 Projections of Emissions from Energy Sector based on Reference Scenario (WEM) 
These projections include policies that no longer reflect the real situation at the time this 
Strategy was finalized.

This sector includes the transport sub-sector and transport emissions, and these emissions and 
transport measures have also been included in the models and projections used in the energy 
sector; for ease of reference, all transport sector measures are described in a separate chapter 
below (the transport sector). 
The WEM scenario contains the policies and measures stated below at the EU level as well 
as national measures that are often related to them: 
  Framework EcoDesign Directive (Directive 2005/32/EC). 
  Energy Labelling Directive (Directive 2010/30/EU). 
  Energy  Performance  of  Buildings  Directive  (2010/31/EU),  Energy 
Efficiency Directive (Directive 2012/27/EU). 
  Completing the internal energy market, including the provisions of the 3rd package 
(Directive 2009/73/EC, Directive 2009/72/EC), Directive (EC) 715/2009, Regulation 
(EC) 714/2009.  
  Directive on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources - 
Directive  on  Renewable  Energy  Sources  -  including  the  amendment  on  ILUC 
(Directive 2009/28/EC as amended by Directive (EU) 2015/1513). 
   Implementation of the Commission proposed EU target for a 27% share of renewable 
energy sources in total consumption by 2030, which was based on the proposal for a 
'Clean Energy for All Europeans' Package presented by the European Commission in 
November 2016. Modelling did not take into account the fact that a much more 
ambitious EU target was finally adopted in December 2018 (32%).  
  The National Renewable Energy Action Plan28 in force since 2011.  
  EU ETS Directive 2003/87/EC with the last amendment in 2015 (by Decision (EU) 
2015/1814 -market stability reserve). The EU ETS is an economic and regulatory 
measure with a high positive impact on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and 
stimulates the use of biomass in the fuel mix and technological innovation. 
  Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council setting 
emission performance standards for passenger cars, Regulation (EC) 443/2009, as 
amended by Regulation EU 333/2014, Directives EURO 5 and 6. 
  Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council on type 
approval of motor vehicles. 
  Regulation  510/2011  setting  emission  performance  standards  for  new  light 
commercial vehicles, as amended by Regulation 253/2014. 
  Act no. 137/2010 Coll. on Air protection, as amended. The Act is amended by Act No. 
401/1998 Coll. on Fees for Air Pollution, which serves for the control and regulation 
of emission limits for basic air pollutants. 
  Increasing energy efficiency with a number of measures in force since 2014 on the 
energy consumption, based on which energy savings are seen as a reduction in final 
                                                 
28 Adopted by Resolution of Slovak Government No. 677/2010

energy consumption. These measures are broken down by sector (buildings, industry, 
public sector, transport and appliances). In the building sector, this primarily involves 
improving  the  thermal-technical  properties  of  buildings  by  implementing  cost-
effective deep renovation of buildings. Legislation and changes to national technical 
standards after 2012 have introduced conditions for the gradual tightening of energy 
performance  requirements  for  new  buildings and  buildings  undergoing  major 
renovation, which are regularly reviewed. Measures in the building sector are the most 
important source of potential energy savings by 2030.  
In addition to the above-mentioned EU-wide policies and the national policies required for 
implementing the 2020 commitments, the WEM scenario includes the following national 
specific measures:  
  Optimization of district heating systems  – shift  from  fossil fuels  to  biomass  and 
natural gas and installation of combined heat and power (CHP) units in district heating 
systems. Industrial Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants produce industrial steam, 
which can also be used for district heating, or is a secondary use of industrial steam. 
Other measures are also taken into account (e.g., improving the efficiency of district 
heating systems (DHS), installing innovative district heating technologies, improving 
heat supply from combined heat and power plants). 
  Gradual decommissioning of solid fuel heating systems from 2025. 
  Subsidies to support alternative-fuel vehicles. 
The development of projected GHG emissions expressed as a CO  equivalent based on the 
2
scenario with measures (WEM) from the energy sector, which also includes the transport 
sector, is shown in Table 6 in Annex I and Figure 7. Separate projections of emissions from 
transport are described below in more detail in a separate section. Table 8 in Annex I 
describes the quantified mitigation measures of part of these WEM measures (including two 
WAM measures).

Based on the projections in the WEM reference scenario, it is clear that additional measures 
need to be taken in the future to reverse trends in emissions that are incompatible with 
Slovakia's target of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. 
2.5.1.3 Projections  of  fugitive  CH   and  CO   emissions  from  coal  mining  and  mining 
4 2
activities in 2017 – 2040 under the WEM reference scenario 
The projections of fugitive emissions of methane and CO  from underground coal mining and 
2
mining activities in the Slovak Republic were estimated based on the following assumptions:  
  Expected termination of electricity production in Nováky in the general economic 
interest for the production of electricity from domestic coal in Slovenské elektrárne, 
a.s. (JSC) has been approved by the Government of the Slovak Republic by the end of 
2023 (the model envisaged the year 2030); 
  Progressive reduction of coal mining is also recorded in connection with the closure of 
the Dolina Mine in 2015 and the termination of mining in the Cígeľ Mine (HBP, a.s) 
in 2017;  
  It is expected that, due to the end of higher economic interest for the production of 
electricity  from  domestic  coal  in  Nováky  power  plants,  after  2023  mining  will 
decrease more rapidly (the model envisaged the year 2030). 
The models of these projections included policies that no longer reflect the real situation at the 
time the Strategy was finalized. In 2019 it was decided to stop the production of electricity 
from domestic coal in Nováky (the public economic interest) by the end of 2023 and to 
transform the fuel base at the Vojany Power Plant. According to the Action Plan for the 
Transformation of the Upper Nitra Region, the Nováky Plant can remain the primary heat 
source for the region after its transformation from solid fossil fuels. The Vojany Power Plant 
is planned to be transformed into a secondary fuel installation in order to get away from 
dependence on imported primary energy sources, as well as to support the circular economy 
in the region.

Based on the projections in the WEM reference scenario, it is clear that additional measures 
need to be taken in the future to reverse trends in emissions that are incompatible with 
Slovakia's target of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. 
2.5.1.4 Projections of fugitive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from oil and natural gas 
production, transport and distribution in the SR for 2017 – 2040 under the WEM 
reference scenario 
The  projections  of  fugitive  greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions  from  oil  and  natural  gas 
production, transport and distribution in the Slovak Republic were estimated based on the 
following assumptions:   
  Oil production in the Slovak Republic is expected to end after 2020; 
  Natural gas production will only decline slowly;  
  Consumption  /  distribution  of  natural  gas  and  oil  in  Slovakia  will  be  without 
significant changes; 
  Rerouting gas supplies through the North Stream pipeline will reduce the amount of 
gas transported to other countries by pipelines in Slovakia, resulting in a drop in 
fugitive CH emissions.

Based on the projections in the WEM reference scenario, it is clear that additional 
measures  need  to  be  taken  in  the  future  to  reverse  trends  in  emissions  that  are 
incompatible with Slovakia's target of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. 
 
2.5.1.5 Possibilities of Decarbonising the Energy Sector under the WAM Scenario 
The models of these projections included policies that no longer reflect the real situation, as 
recent developments have been moving towards more ambitious measures (the ambitious EC 
plans described in the European Green Deal).  
The specification of the WAM scenario depends on the logic of the proposal of EU scenarios 
and in particular on the EUCO30 scenario29, which sets the EU target for energy efficiency 
for 2030 at 30%. The scenario includes all measures from the WEM scenario, plus it also 
includes the following measures, which also no longer take into account the real situation at 
the time the Strategy was finalized (different targets for RES and EE, ambitious new EC plans 
under the Green Deal):  
  The national RES target was set at 18.91% in the model.  
  The national target for ESR is -20%.    
  The national target for primary EE savings in the model was set -28.36%. 
  An increase in EU ETS carbon prices after 2020 - The EU ETS carbon price affects 
both energy and energy-intensive industries and is a major driving force for cutting 
emissions. Electricity producers will have to respond to the pressure of rising prices of 
                                                 
29 In 2016, the European Commission developed two basic policy scenarios, the EUCO27 and EUCO30, using the PRIMES 
model, which was based on the EU Reference Scenario 2016. EUCO scenarios include the achievement of the 2030 energy 
and climate targets for 2030 and a 27% or 30% energy efficiency target. www.ec.europa.eu/energy/en/data-
analysis/energy-modelling

emission allowances in order to facilitate their own shift from coal to other low-
emission to non-emission sources. 
  Earlier decommissioning of solid fuel power plants. The decommissioning of Vojany 
and Nováky is expected in 2025 and 2023, respectively.  
  Decarbonisation  of  electricity  generation  after  2020  thanks  to  RES  and  the 
development of nuclear energy.  
  RES support scheme for electricity generation with envisaged RES technologies such 
as solar photovoltaics, onshore wind turbines, biogas/biomethane and biomass. The 
scenarios assume the support of 50 MW in 2021-2025, followed by support of an 
additional 500 MW based on auction.  
  Increasing the share of nuclear energy in the energy mix of the Slovak Republic. This 
increase in the medium term (2020 - 2025) will be due mainly to the commissioning of 
two new nuclear reactors at the Mochovce Nuclear Power Plant.  
  Continuation of an improvement of final energy efficiency in all sectors after 2020. 
The measure gives emphasis to policies promoting accelerated renovation of building 
stock  (both  residential  and  non-residential,  private  and  public)  with  a  focus  on 
implementing  cost-effective  deep  renovation of  buildings  and  applying  minimum 
energy performance requirements for nearly zero-energy buildings after 2020 in the 
case  of  new  buildings.  Energy  efficiency  policies  for  the  energy  sector  include 
encouraging the use of new innovative technologies in industrial production (BAT 
techniques); in the transport sector they are policies focused on infrastructure as well 
as soft measures for greater efficiency. 
  Electrification of transport  after  2020,  which  will  mean  in  practice  increasing  the 
percentage of electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles that will replace vehicles with 
internal combustion engines. 
  Carbon capture and storage was excluded from the modelling 
The development of projected GHG emissions expressed as a CO  equivalent based on the 
2
decarbonisation scenario with additional measures (WEM) from the energy sector is shown in 
Table 7 in Annex I and Figure 10.

The WB modelling (as described in more detail in the WB Study, Chapter 430) used in the 
WAM scenario suggests several findings that can be applied in the planning of future 
actions and priorities: 
In the short term, the most important source of possible energy savings by 2030 is the 
building renovation policy. 
After  2030,  a number  of  savings  would  be  thanks  to  heat  recovery  and  the 
electrification of transport.   
In the medium term, the demand for electricity increases at a lower speed than in the 
WEM reference scenario. This result stems from additional efficiency policies that support 
improvements in energy efficiency. Therefore, the demand for electricity should be reduced in 
the future. However, a reverse trend has been observed in the long term.  
In the long term, the demand for electricity increases at a lower speed than in the reference 
scenario. New ways of using electricity in heating (e.g., heat pumps), the launch of the 
electrification of appliances and transport not only maintains, but also accelerates the 
growth of electricity demand. The new nuclear reactor should be completed before 2050.  
  In  terms  of  overall  energy  savings,  the  largest  potential  from  among  all 
consumption sectors is expected in industry; other important sectors are the 
building and transport sectors. 
  More stringent efficiency policies further stimulate the reduction rates of final 
energy demand in all sectors of demand except for the transport sector. 
                                                 
30 https://www.minzp.sk/files/oblasti/politika-zmeny-klimy/2019_01_low-carbon-study.pdf 
34
 
    
  CO standards  for  cars,  vans  and  trucks,  together  with  the 
2 
electrification of transport  and  higher  use  of  biofuels  allow  for  a  significant 
reduction in fossil energy demand in the transport sector. 
  In the industrial sectors, energy demand growth is slowing as more ambitious 
efficiency  policies  are  envisaged,  identifying  extensive energy  efficiency 
improvements  over  the  period  of  2025-  2035.  After  2035,  energy  savings  in 
industry do not show significant differences, suggesting that the trajectory of 
increased EU ETS price is becoming the key driver that allows for the use of 
efficient technologies and investment in them. 
 
According to the NECP plan, which is based on these findings, Slovakia has space for the 
decarbonisation of energy mainly in the substitution of coal with low-emission sources, 
energy efficiency measures and transport decarbonisation, given the high share of nuclear 
sources  in  electricity  production  and  the  high  share  of  natural  gas  in  the  heat  sector. 
Decarbonisation of the Slovak economy will be associated with additional costs, and therefore 
its implementation  will require a  gradual  replacement of high-emission sources by low-
emission sources, the prices of which are likely to fall and the availability of which is likely to 
increase compared to conventional sources, the price of which, by contrast, will grow with all 
measures.  
Based on the projections in the WAM scenario (as well as of the emission gap identified 
in  Chapter  2.1.1),  it  is  clear  that  despite  the  inclusion  of  additional  measures  in 
modelling,  this  sector  will  not  be  able  to  contribute  sufficiently  to  achieve  climate 
neutrality in 2050 with its reduction. Based on the projections, CO2 emissions in 2050 
from the energy sector alone (Figure 4 in Chapter 2) are still higher than the entire 
target emission gap (of 7MtCO2 eq., as described in more detail in Chapter 2.1.1 ), 
which the SR can emit as a maximum amount in 2050 if it wants to achieve climate 
neutrality.  It  will  therefore  be  necessary  to  adopt  a  series  of  additional  measures 
identified as NEUTRAL measures.  
 
2.5.1.6 Possibilities of Decarbonisation of Fugitive CH  and CO  Emissions from Coal 
4 2
Mining and Mining Activities under the WAM Scenario 
Future policies have been included in these models as part of projections that no longer reflect 
the actual situation as recent developments are moving towards more ambitious measures in 
the near future (new EC and plans to increase ambitions).   
The  projections  of  fugitive  CH   and CO   emissions  were  calculated  based  on  the  same 
4 2
measures and data as in the WEM scenario, except that a faster drop of coal mining in the

Based on the projections in the WAM scenario (as well as of the emission gap identified 
in  Chapter  2.1.1),  it  is  clear  that  despite  the  inclusion  of  additional  measures  in 
modelling,  this  sector  will  not  be  able  to  contribute  sufficiently  to  achieve  climate 
neutrality in 2050 with its reduction. It will therefore be necessary to adopt a series of 
additional measures identified as NEUTRAL measures.  
 
2.5.1.7 Possibilities of decarbonisation of fugitive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 
oil and natural gas production, transport and distribution in the SR for 2017 – 2040 
under the WAM scenario 
For the calculation of fugitive emissions (and projections) from the production, transport and 
distribution of natural gas and oil in the Slovak Republic, the same data and measures were 
used as in the WEM scenario, with the only exception being that long-distance natural gas 
transport (transit) was calculated with a significant drop in transit after 2020 (as a result of 
rerouting gas supplies through the North Stream pipeline).32

Based on the projections in the WAM scenario (as well as of the emission gap identified 
in  Chapter  2.1.1),  it  is  clear  that  despite  the  inclusion  of  additional  measures  in 
modelling,  this  sector  will  not  be  able  to  contribute  sufficiently  to  achieve  climate 
neutrality by 2050 with its reduction. It will therefore be necessary to adopt a series of 
additional measures identified as NEUTRAL measures.  
 
 
2.5.1.8 OTHER ADDITIONAL MEASURES (NEUTRAL) TO ACHIEVE THE CLIMATE 
NEUTRALITY TARGET IN THE ENERGY SECTOR (INCLUDING ENERGY 
EFFICIENCY INCREASE MEASURES) UP TO 2050 
This  sector  includes  the  transport  sub-sector  and  fugitive  emissions  from  fuels. 
Transport emissions and additional measures to further reduce them have also been 
included in the models and projections used in the energy sector; for ease of reference, 
all transport sector measures are described in a separate chapter below (the transport 
sector). For reasons of clarity, measures increasing energy efficiency are described in 
a separate chapter, but they are taken as part of the energy sector. 
CO  emissions from the energy sector are still projected to be higher in 2050 alone than 
2
the entire emission gap (as described in more detail in Chapter 2.1.1), which will have to 
be eliminated by 2050 for the SR to achieve climate neutrality by then. Plus, this sector, 
if not counting transport, falls almost entirely under the ETS, which, according to the 
WAM  scenario  (Chapter  2.2.2),  will  not  achieve  the  national  target  for  emission 
reduction by 2030. It is therefore necessary to increase the reduction effort, either by 
adopting  new  additional  measures  (NEUTRAL)  or  implementing  already  existing 
measures (some of which are also included in this list), which are often adopted in other 
strategies (the NECP, Envirostrategy) and laws but their implementation in practice is 
still insufficient in terms of contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In 
37
 
    
order to achieve climate neutrality, it will be desirable to effectively set up a long-term 
and predictable framework for financial support.  
  Establish  of  the  Council of  the Government  of  the  Slovak  Republic  for  the 
European Green Deal and Low-Carbon Transformation, which will serve as an 
interdepartmental coordination body at the highest level in order to streamline the 
low-carbon transformation of Slovakia towards climate neutrality by 2050. 
  Adopt of a climate change law to address mitigation and adaptation to climate 
change. 
  Create conditions and remove barriers to optimal use of energy sources without 
greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  to  support  those  sources  and  projects  that  can 
replace fossil fuels in order to ensure the reliability of electricity or heat production 
and supply while maintaining cost-efficiency and environmental friendliness and 
respecting the conservation or improvement of biodiversity.  
  Reduce  legislative,  technical,  administrative  and  financial  barriers  to  the 
implementation of these resources with an emphasis on the self-consumers sector. 
  Develop sustainable use criteria for all renewable energy sources that will be 
legally binding. 
  Align the development of heating installations with local development concepts in 
the field of thermal energy. 
  Avoid discrimination of sources so that the price of carbon is also taken into 
account for fuel combustion plants with a total rated thermal input of less than 20 
MW, as is the case for larger installations covered by the ETS. 
  Take into account the principle that measures to meet the targets for reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions should at the same time make it possible to achieve the 
objectives of improving air quality and not lead to air quality deterioration (for 
example, excessive support for direct biomass combustion leads to increased PM 
emissions and deterioration of the air quality). 
  Increase energy efficiency in the building sector, preferably by replacing old 
inefficient and non-ecological solid fuel heating installations with modern 
installations (including RES) in combination with thermal insulation.  
  Differentiate registration fees included in the price of new boilers to promote more 
environmentally-friendly combustion plants. 
  Establish awareness campaigns and education on good practice in coal and 
biomass combustion. 
  Continue (or extend) the support scheme for the effective transition to the use of 
low-emission thermal-energy installations. 
  Set the conditions for CHP, including the rules for prohibiting the disconnection 
from  CHP,  which,  according  to  the  Energy  Efficiency  Directive  and  the 
Renewable Energy Directive, means the possibility of disconnecting from CHP 
only in the case of ineffective CHP and only if the new system is cost-efficient and 
environmentally effective  and  does  not  increase  pollutant  and  greenhouse  gas 
emissions in the relevant location. According to the Renewable Energy Directive, 
38
 
    
in the case of disconnection, it is necessary to pay CHP all costs incurred by the 
original operator in connection with the disconnection from CHP.    
  Use existing gas infrastructure for renewable energy sources due to the highly 
developed  transmission  and  distribution  network,  including  underground 
reservoirs, which is a precondition for further decarbonisation of the economy. 
  Promote the interconnection of the electricity and gas sectors through so-called 
Power-to-X technology and enable an increase in the level of hydrogen blending to 
natural gas. 
  Set  up  long-term  support  for  increasing  the  proportion  of  decarbonised  gases 
(biogas, biomethane, hydrogen, synthetic methane). 
  Promote negative emission technology as defined in the IPCC.  
  Set financial support mechanism objectives from the EU and the Slovak Republic 
to allow the financing of as many decarbonisation measures as possible, taking 
into account the diversity of entities operating in the energy sector, including 
reducing the administrative burden in the submission of projects. 
  Offer legislative and financial support from the EU and SR by developing local 
sources  for  electricity  production  by  enabling  the  supply  of  electricity  to  the 
distribution  system  aimed  at  reducing  losses  in  electricity  transmission, 
distribution and transformation. This will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
transmission capacity building costs as electricity is expected to be consumed by 
the nearest customers. 
  Transform fossil-fuel power plants – The termination of electricity production in 
Nováky in the general economic interest by 2023 and the transformation of the 
fuel base at the Vojany Power Plant. The Nováky Plant will remain the primary 
heat source for the relevant region after its transformation, which will be based on 
a combination  of  renewable  sources  and  high-efficiency  heat  and  electricity 
production. The Vojany Power Plant is planned to be transformed into a secondary 
fuel installation in order to move away from dependence on imported primary 
energy sources, as well as to support the circular economy in the region.  
  Maintain electricity generation from existing hydroelectric power stations as far as 
possible and encourage investment in their modernization and renewal, including 
pumped-storage  power  stations,  which  provide  flexibility  and  storage  for 
electricity. 
  Support  the  decarbonisation  of  energy  by  replacing  coal  with  low-emission 
sources, or sources with alternative fuels (e.g., solid secondary fuels containing 
bio-components or RES). 
  Make use of funds from the Modernisation Fund to modernize energy and industry 
as far as possible, in particular to reduce fossil fuel consumption from energy and 
industry. 
  Innovative financing is expected in increasing the energy use of waste, waste gases 
and waste heat in industry and energy.  
  Reassess the system of excise duty on energy products in harmony with EU policy 
so that products are taxed on the basis of negative environmental impact, while 
39
 
    
allowing  full  application  of  the  options  in  Directive  2003/96  EC,  i.e.  the 
application  of  a  preferential  tax  rate  on  energy  products  used  for  industrial 
purposes, in particular electricity. 
  Promote research and the application of innovative technologies for the capture 
and  utilisation  of  greenhouse  gases  (so-called  CCU  -  Carbon  Capture  and 
Utilisation, synthetic fuels) as well as the storage of greenhouse gases (so-called 
CCS - Carbon Capture and Storage). 
 
 
 
MEASURES TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY 
 
  Consistently apply the principles of green procurement for all energy efficiency 
measures with an emphasis on energy consumption and emissions throughout the 
life cycle of the measure. 
  Increase the energy savings achieved in building renovation from 30% to 60% as 
building renovation is also the most economical and effective measure under the 
Low-Carbon Growth Study for Slovakia prepared in cooperation with the WB. 
  Increase the rate of renovation of public buildings and family houses.   
  For  public  building  support,  in  particular,  deep  renovation  of  buildings,  in 
accordance with the principles of green public procurement.  
  Set up financial support mechanisms from the EU and Slovakia so that they can 
finance  the  deep  renovation  of  public  buildings  and  create  the  necessary 
opportunities for financing the renovation of buildings in the Bratislava region in 
accordance with the principles of green public procurement.   
  Create  multi-source  financing  for  regional  development,  so-called  Regional 
Development Funds that would allow the financing of decarbonisation measures in 
the relevant regions (forms of funding ranging from grants to revolving funds, not 
just EU funds and co-financing but all public and non-public funds). 
  Promote the establishment of regional centres of sustainable energy and regional 
energy centres that would provide support and advisory services at the regional 
level with the aim of increasing energy efficiency and increasing the share of RES.  
  Promote improvement of the expertise of designers and building companies with a 
focus on deep renovation of buildings. 
  Promote  the  improvement  of  buildings’  energy  performance  with  measures 
implemented in the heating and cooling sector aimed at decarbonising the supply 
of  heat  to  buildings  from  district  heating  and  cooling  systems.  Promote  only 
effective CHS systems with heat supply from RES, waste heat from industrial and 
energy processes based on economically cost-effective use of RES, e.g., including 
locally available biomass/biomethane and waste. 
  Modernize the existing CHS systems in the field of thermal energy. 
  Introduce new district heating systems in valleys and basins in a cost-effective way 
with increased deployment of RES in systems.  
40
 
    
  Extend the energy efficiency monitoring system operated by the Slovak Innovation 
and Energy Agency with the aim of creating a single database centre that would 
cover  both  the  private  and  public  building  renovation  sectors,  including  an 
overview of public buildings in the Slovak Republic.   
  Use innovative financial mechanisms (green debentures and green bonds, energy 
savings  audits,  guaranteed  energy  services,  an  auction  system  for  energy 
purchases,  soft  loans  through  revolving  funds,  a  bonus-malus  financing 
mechanism, soft-rate mortgages for energy-efficient buildings). 
  Install and deploy smart metering systems in energy systems and installations, 
including  gas  distribution  and  supply  (where  the  benefit  to  the  consumer 
demonstrably outweighs the cost of deploying the said systems)  
  Consistently apply the “Polluter Pays” principle  
  End the provision of environmentally harmful subsidies, such as support for coal 
or biomass from unsustainable sources. 
  Set up rules for the absorption of funds from financial support mechanisms from 
the EU and Slovakia in the area of energy efficiency so that the energy sector is 
also entitled to benefit from subsidies for investment that demonstrably reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
  Support so-called ESCO (energy service company) companies as energy service 
providers with guaranteed savings for the public sector, so-called EPC (Energy 
Performance Contracting) and support in the form of Guaranteed Energy Services 
according to Act No. 321/2014 Coll. on energy efficiency. 
  Support the development of heat pumps for the production of heat and cold by 
creating  funding instruments in  order to  also  increase the  availability of heat 
pumps for low-income segments of the population. 
  In order to increase the energy performance of buildings, focus on  the active 
application of passive elements and passive technologies in the building, i.e. to 
reduce heat transfer through the external cladding and roofing (by applying the 
elements of climatic, energy-active applications) as well as through nature-friendly 
solutions such as planned greenery in streets, car parks (which would serve as 
climatic  and  energy-active  areas),  green  roofs  and  walls  providing  thermal 
protection and shade to buildings.  
  In the context of updating this Strategy, consider introducing a target for the whole 
building sector (whether for 2030, 2040 or 205033), which would be in harmony 
with the target of achieving climate neutrality by 2050.  
  Provide for education, awareness-raising and information for the general public on 
the need for additional measures in this sector.  
                                                 
33 The external consulting organization BPIE recommends reducing overall energy consumption in buildings by 60% by 2050 
to achieve the climate neutrality target.

2.5.2  INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES SECTOR 
2.5.2.1 Current Trends in Reducing Emissions and Energy Demand 
The industrial processes and product use (IPPU) sector covers the greenhouse gas emissions 
resulting from technological processes producing raw materials and products.  
In 2016, total aggregate GHG emissions from the IPPU sector amounted to 9,338.23 Gg CO  
2
eq. In comparison with the 1990 base year, emissions dropped by 4.6%. CO  is the most 
2
important gas, with a 91% share, followed by F-gas emissions (7%) and N O emissions (2%), 
2
which is shown in Figure 27 in Annex I. The most important sources of greenhouse gas 
emissions are the following categories: metal production (52%), mineral industry (23%), 
chemical industry (16%), and substitutes for ozone-depleting substances (7%). The most 
important source of N O emissions is the production of nitric acid.

The energy intensity of industrial processes in the Slovak Republic decreased significantly 
compared to the 1990 base year. According to the SO SR, there was a drop in the energy 
intensity of the SR by 41.0% between 2005 and 2017. The drop results from GDP growth 
(52.4%) and the current decline in gross domestic energy consumption (10.0%).  
According to EUROSTAT34 data, the energy intensity in Slovakia is still relatively higher 
compared to the EU average. This is due to the historical structure of industrial production.  
Decreasing trends of final energy consumption in this sector is characterized by a decrease in 
total energy consumption. This represents a 32.5% share of total final energy consumption in 
Slovakia.  The  following  industry  sectors  contribute  significantly  to  fuel  and  energy 
consumption: metallurgy 32%, energy sector 32%, chemical industry 11%, pharmaceutical 
industry  11%,  wood  processing  4%,  mechanical  engineering  3%,  textile  industry  2%, 
electrotechnical industry, glass and footwear production approximately 1% each.

2.5.2.2 Projections of emissions in industry under the WEM reference scenario 
The projections of greenhouse gas emissions from the IPPU sector which are integrated into 
the EU ETS (large industrial enterprises) are modelled jointly with the energy sector. Policies 
are based on the EU 2016 Reference Scenario35, where several pieces of legislation are 
mentioned, such as Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions, Directive 2001/81/EC on 
national emission ceilings and the Fluorinated Greenhouse Gas Regulation. The projections of 
greenhouse gas emissions from the IPPU sector which are not integrated into the EU ETS 
have been modelled with the trend of value-added development in the industry segment and 
productivity and fuel consumption trends. Also, it was assumed that obsolete installations 
would gradually be eliminated for SF emissions (part ofF-gases).  
6   
The development of greenhouse gas emission projections expressed as a CO  equivalent 
2
under the reference scenario (WEM) from the IPPU sector including F-gases is shown in 
Table 9 in Annex I and Figure 10.

Based on the projections in the WEM reference scenario, it is clear that additional 
measures  need  to  be  taken  in  the  future  to  reverse  trends  in  emissions  that  are 
incompatible with Slovakia's target of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. 
2.5.2.3 Possibilities of Decarbonising the IPPU Sector under the WAM Scenario 
The projections of emissions from the IPPU sector which are integrated into the EU ETS 
(large  industrial  enterprises)  were  modelled  jointly  with  the  energy  sector  (the  WAM 
scenario), and the projections of emissions from the IPPU sector which are not integrated into 
the EU ETS were modelled with the trend of value added development and the effect of

measures by individual production category. However, the modelling as such did not include 
new measures concerning the technological processes which are responsible for industrial 
emissions themselves. Also, the ambitious EC plans from the European Green Deal were not 
taken into account in the modelling. In addition, compared to the WEM scenario, it was 
assumed for F-gases that all refrigerants must be supplied from gases with a low global 
warming potential (GWP) (or additional gases), and SF6 emissions were foreseen to be 
prohibited from using SF6 in new installations. 
The development of greenhouse gas emission projections expressed as a CO  equivalent 
2
under the scenario with measures (WAM) from the IPPU sector is shown in Table 10 in 
Annex I and Figure 11.

Based on the projections in the WAM scenario (as well as of the emission gap identified 
in  Chapter  2.1.1),  it  is  clear  that  despite  the  inclusion  of  additional  measures  in 
modelling,  this  sector  will  not  be  able  to  contribute  sufficiently  to  achieve  climate 
neutrality in 2050 with its reduction. It will therefore be necessary to adopt a series of 
additional measures identified as NEUTRAL measures.  
2.5.2.4 OTHER ADDITIONAL MEASURES (NEUTRAL) TO ACHIEVE THE CLIMATE 
NEUTRALITY TARGET IN THE IPPU SECTOR UP TO 2050 
This sector falls almost entirely under the ETS, where it accounts for less than a half of 
the  emissions  and  in  which,  according  to  the  WAM  scenario  (Chapter  2.2.2),  the 
national emission reduction target will not be achieved by 2030. Thus, additional efforts 
will have to be made beyond the measures in the WAM scenario to meet the national 
emission reduction target in the ETS sector. Moreover, in the long term, emissions in 
this sector in 2040 are projected to be the same as the overall target emission gap (in the 
amount of 7 MtCO2 eq., as described in more detail in Chapter 2.1.1 ) which the SR can 
emit as a maximum amount in 2050 to reach climate neutrality.   
44
 
    
It  is  therefore  necessary  to  increase  the  reduction  effort,  either  by  adopting  new 
additional measures (NEUTRAL) or implementing already existing measures (some of 
which are also included in this list), and which are often adopted in other strategies and 
laws but their implementation in practice is still insufficient in terms of contributing to 
the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In order to achieve climate neutrality, it will 
be desirable to effectively set up a long-term and predictable framework for financial 
support. 
 
  Introduce  additional  energy  efficiency  improvements  in  industry  and  industrial 
processes beyond the scope of modelled scenarios.  
  Introduce the circular economy and innovation into industrial processes, e.g., the use 
of hydrogen as an innovative technology (including the transition of hydrogen-based 
steel production in the case of sufficient hydrogen supply), including adherence to 
BAT (best available techniques) Conclusions. 
  Innovate energy- and material-intensive industrial operations. 
  Transition to new, cleaner ways to produce energy and products, including through the 
use  of  energy  sources  without  emitting  greenhouse  gases  in  industry  or  the 
introduction of circular economy principles. 
  Reduce  the  use  of  fossil  fuels  in  industry  provided  that  it  is  technically  and 
economically efficient and that this solution will bring real emission savings . 
  Capture and use all waste heat from industrial and energy processes in a cost-effective 
way. 
  Set up financial support mechanisms from the EU and Slovakia so that they can 
finance as many decarbonisation and energy-saving measures as possible, including 
reducing the administrative burden when submitting projects. 
  Include the implementation of the Paris Agreement as one of the basic provisions in 
international  trade  agreements  between  the  EU  and  third  countries  (the  so-called 
"Paris clause"). 
  Ensure transformation does not jeopardize the competitiveness of industry. For this 
reason, it is necessary to introduce support measures for both importers of products 
from  third  countries  to  the  EU  and  exporters  of  products  from  the  EU  to  third 
countries. As a support measure for importers, the Slovak Republic promotes the 
introduction of a carbon border adjustment/tax, but at the same time it is necessary to 
address measures to maintain the competitiveness of exporters.

2.5.3  TRANSPORT SECTOR 
2.5.3.1 Current Trends in Reducing Emissions in the Transport Sector  
Transport has a very special position in the energy sector as it is not covered by the EU ETS 
or other laws, so emissions in this category are very difficult to control. In recent years, a shift 
from public transport to individual passenger cars has been observed. The level of transit 
traffic has increased. Fuel consumption in rail transport has been increasing slightly in the last 
year and fuel consumption in road transport has risen rapidly. Total aggregate GHG emissions 
in the transport sector increased by 12% compared in 2017 to the 1990 base year, while road 
transport emissions increased by 58% compared to the base year (1990). The long-term trend 
is opposite to most sectors – i.e. rising emissions and therefore this sector represents  a 
substantial risk in terms of emissions for achieving climate neutrality. Therefore, considerable 
attention should be paid to it in the future.

1990 - 2016  
 
Source: SHMI 
 
2.5.3.2 Projections of emissions in transport sector under the WEM reference scenario 
Policies have been included in these models as part of projections that no longer reflect the 
actual situation at the time this Strategy was finalized (new legislation on CO  standards).  
2
 The following measures have been taken into account in modelling:  
  CO  emission standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, efficiency 
2
standards for trucks, together with the electrification of transport in force since 2007. 
This has the effect of increasing the efficiency of cars, reducing fuel consumption and 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions from passenger cars, light commercial vehicles 
and trucks thanks to the increased efficiency of engines and production. 
46
 
    
  Measures in accordance with the Ecodesign Directive. The purpose of these measures 
is to reduce the environmental impact at all stages of the product life cycle. The 
challenge in the application of ecodesign in the automotive industry is the complex 
interaction of various, partly conflicting influencing factors. The automotive industry 
is forced to take into account the entire life cycle of cars. In addition to reducing fuel 
consumption and emissions, production as well as the end-of-life phase of a car must 
be taken into account.  
  Supporting biofuels in road transport since 2010. The Slovak Republic plans to speed 
up the implementation of second-generation biofuels made from non-food crops such 
as wood, organic waste, waste from food crops and specific biomass crops. After 2020 
operators are obliged to blend biofuels  with fossil fuels with a minimum energy 
content as follows:  
7.6% in 2020, 8.0% in 2021 and 8.2% in 2022 – 2030. 
  The energy share of advanced biofuel must be at least:  
0.5% in 2020 – 2024 and 0.75% in 2025 – 2030. 
The transport sector is mainly subject to EU-wide regulation. In general, a trend towards the 
gradual  electrification  of  transport  is  generally  visible  after  2020,  which  has  been  most 
reflected in the models after 2030, and in practice will mean a higher share of electric vehicles 
and fuel cell vehicles which will replace vehicles with internal combustion engines. The total 
number of passenger cars remains the same, except that vehicles with internal combustion 
engines are replaced by electric vehicles. For more information on the projection of fuel 
consumption and projections of greenhouse gas emissions in transport, please see Table 11 in 
Annex I.

In addition to projections for greenhouse gas emissions in road transport, projections for 
emissions from non-road transport (air, ship transport) in the Slovak Republic were also 
calculated, but their share in total emissions from transport is minimum. Only a scenario with 
NECP measures was prepared for these projections).   
Based on the projections in the WEM reference scenario, it is clear that additional 
measures  need  to  be  taken  in  the  future  to  reverse  trends  in  emissions  that  are 
incompatible with Slovakia's target of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. 
 
2.5.3.3 Possibilities of Decarbonising the Transport Sector under the WAM Scenario 
The following extra measures were used in modelling compared to the WEM scenario:  
  Changing the distribution of traffic, which will result in a reduction in the performance 
of road freight transport for roads over 300 km, of which 30% should be transferred to 
railway or waterway transport. 
  Economic and tax instruments, which will result in a change in the projected energy 
consumption, environmentally friendly fuels will dominate, which should be with a 
lower tax. 
  Increased road charging, which will result in a change in demand for road freight 
transport. 
According to the calculated projections (Figure 14) broken down by individual gas (Table 12 
in Annex I), there are clear downward emission trends for CO  and N O until 2040 but CH  
2 2 4
emissions are growing in the WAM scenario compared to the WEM scenario. The most 
probable  reason  is  a  growing  trend  of  natural  gas  consumption  and biogas/biomethane 
consumption in road transport and its increasing share in fuel consumption, which has been 
included in the WAM scenario.  
The  models  of  these  projections  included  future  policies  that  no  longer  reflect  the  real 
situation, as recent developments have been moving towards more ambitious measures in the 
near future (higher RES targets thus increasing the share of biofuels in transport in Slovakia, 
new  EC  European  legislation  in  the  field  of  transport  such  as  new  CO   standards  and 
2
ambitious EC plans under the European Green Deal).  
In addition to existing and additional measures, the Slovak Republic has taken other measures 
that have not been taken into account in the modelling, but which will contribute to reducing 
greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  transport  and  which  will  need  to  be  included  in  the  new 
modelling, in particular: 
In accordance with the approved National Energy and Climate Plan, measures are taken in the 
transport sector for fuel suppliers 
•  Increase the share of RES in fuels to 14% in 2030 in line with the indicative trajectory. 
48
 
    
•  Reach a share of advanced biofuels in fuels to: 0.5% in 2022; 1% in 2025 and 3.5% in 
2030.

WAM scenario 
 
 
CO2 eq. (Gg) WAM scenario

Based on projections in the WAM scenario, where transport emissions in 2040 are only 
slightly lower than the target emission gap (7 MtCO2 eq., as described in more detail in 
Chapter 2.1.1) which the SR can emit as a maximum amount in 2050 to reach climate 
neutrality. Despite the inclusion of additional measures in modelling, this sector will not 
be able to contribute sufficiently to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 with its reduction. 
It will therefore be necessary to adopt a series of additional measures identified as 
NEUTRAL measures.  
 
 
2.5.3.4 OTHER  ADDITIONAL  MEASURES  (NEUTRAL)  IN  THE  TRANSPORT 
SECTOR TO ACHIEVE THE CLIMATE NEUTRALITY TARGET UP TO 2050 
Given the current upward trends in transport emissions, it is necessary to increase the 
reduction  effort,  either  by  adopting  new  additional  measures  (NEUTRAL)  or 
implementing already existing measures (some of which are also included in this list), 
and which are often adopted in other transport strategies but their implementation in 
practice is still insufficient in terms of contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions. In order to achieve climate neutrality, it will be desirable to effectively set up 
a long-term and predictable framework for financial support. 
 
49
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
  Increase the attractiveness and comfort of public transport at all levels: 
 
-  Enable the arrival of private rail carriers on national routes;  
-  Renew the rail carrier’s train fleet; 
-  Support the development of public passenger rail transport (trams and trolleybuses), 
support the development of alternative-fuelled bus public passenger transport and 
support regular alternative-fuelled passenger ship transport; 
-  Gradually reduce the procurement of public transport vehicles using fossil fuels with 
high greenhouse gas emissions, from public funds; 
-  Harmonize national and local public passenger transport timetables; 
-  Expand the Integrated transport system (IDS) to other regions;  
-  Introduce and support flexible public passenger transport systems (bus on demand or 
with flexible routes), particularly in areas with low population density; 
-  Develop Park&Ride facilities; 
-  Carpooling;  
-  Introduce financial and support measures to make public transport more financially 
attractive to the public than individual car transport.  
 
  Fully electrify the railway network and make rail freight transport more attractive 
(including increasing its capacity) to carry goods. 
  Support  the  development  of  intermodal  transport,  the  completion  of  intermodal 
transport  terminals,  and  diverting  transit  and  traffic  over  a  certain  number  of 
kilometres compulsorily to railway or waterway transport, use of alternative fuels as a 
priority. 
  Lower the carbon  footprint  of  urban  public  transport  with  available  technology 
(electrification, bioCNG, liquid biofuels, hydrogen). 
  Support  cycling  in  the  form  of  subsidies  for  the  emergence  of  new  cycling 
infrastructure  and  plan  cycle  paths  in  advance  and  support  in  the  urban  road 
infrastructure as one of the pillars of passenger transport in cities. 
  Introduce  bikesharing  in  cities  and  villages  and  its  integration  into  the  public 
passenger transport system. 
  Educate on the benefits of green transport and support sustainable mobility campaigns 
(Riding a bicycle to  work, Riding  a bicycle to  school,  Riding a bicycle to  shops, 
European Mobility Week).

forthcoming revision of Council Directive 2003/96/EC36 and according to the OECD 
Recommendations 37 and the Progress Report of the Environmental Performance of 
OECD Recommendations,38 unless they are in contradiction with Council Directive 
2003/96/EC, whereas the measures will take into account price competitiveness and 
elasticity of consumption.  
  Reassess the system of excise duty on energy products in transport so that products are 
taxed on the basis of their adverse impact on the environment, while allowing the 
possibilities of Directive 2003/96 EC to be fully applied.   
  Change passenger car registration fees to reflect CO2 emissions or Euro emission 
standards, or a combination of these, or other factors that reflect environmental criteria 
in the calculation of fees. Toll charges will also include an environmental element in 
passenger transport and will analyse other ways of using economic instruments in 
accordance with the Polluter Pays principle.  
  Support individual automobile transport regulations, in particular in the form of a 
parking  policy  (charges  for  parking,  ban  on  parking  on  pavements)  through  the 
standardization of parking policy throughout the Slovak Republic, while respecting 
technical standards governing the construction of parking places STN 73 6110 /Z1/O1. 
  Introduce low-emission zones in municipalities, including charging for entry into these 
zones and traffic calming in settlements (the introduction of functional 30 zones and 
cycling streets, including transport-technical facilities). 
  Increase the use of alternative fuels but ensure that there is no increase in imports of 
crops with a high risk of indirect land use change (ILUC).  
  Take greenhouse gas emissions from the whole fuel life cycle into account when 
adopting  measures  to  promote  individual  fuels  in  order  to  achieve  low-emission 
transport solutions. 
  Develop infrastructure for alternative fuels more quickly and reconstruct the road 
network to reduce fuel consumption in order to increase support for the development 
of alternative-fuel cars.  
  Set up financial support mechanisms from the EU and Slovakia so that they can 
finance  as  many  decarbonisation  measures  in  the  transport  sector  as  possible, 
including reducing the administrative burden when submitting projects. 
  Remove legislative barriers to the use of underground car parks for CNG, LPG, and 
hydrogen vehicles (the Fire Act, amendment to the Building Act, etc.).

  Prepare and strictly implement the revised Directive 2009/33 on the promotion of 
clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles. 
  Promote the application of green public procurement. 
  Reduce aviation emissions. 
  Support  the  construction  of  infrastructure  for  waterway  transport  enabling  the 
operation  of  alternative  fuel  vessels  in  inland  waterway  transport  and  encourage 
carriers/operators  of  inland  waterway  vessels  to  remotorise  their  alternative-fuel 
vessels. 
  Raise awareness of eco-driving (so-called eco-driving). 
  Initiate a debate on a complete change in the concept of mobility, exploring ways to 
reduce the number of people commuting to school or work and increase support for 
home office.  
  Meet the need for education, awareness-raising and awareness for the general public of 
the need for additional measures in this sector.  
  Consider introducing a reduction target for the whole transport sector (whether for 
2030 or later) as part of updating this Strategy.

2.5.4  AGRICULTURE 
2.5.4.1 Current Trends in Reducing Emissions in Agriculture 
Human  activities  in  the  agricultural  sector  contribute  significantly  to  changes  in  the 
concentration of some gases in the atmosphere, namely N O and CH  are considered to be the 
2 4
most important gases emitted from agriculture in terms of mitigation and adaptation measures 
planned to reduce their environmental impact. The largest share of methane emissions is from 
the category of Enteric Fermentation, which produced 34.42 Gg (76.3%) of methane in the 
sector in 2016. The main source of N O emissions is agricultural soil with a 90% share, 
2
followed by the Manure Processing category with a 10% share of total N O emissions. Figure 
2
15  shows  total  emission  trends  after  the  1990  base  year  by  gas  and  main  category  in 
agriculture. In the Slovak Republic, agricultural production stopped growing at the end of the 
1980s. This was followed by a drop in 1990 - 2002 due to economic and political changes in 
the country. After these years, agriculture has stabilized. Improvements in the agricultural 
sector, the regeneration of crop production and the use of mineral  fertilisers resulted in 
a slight increase in emissions over the last six years (2010-2016).

2.5.4.2 Projections of emissions in agriculture under the WEM reference scenario  (the 
same applies also to the WAM scenario) 
Compared to  other sectors, the production  and  removal of  greenhouse gas  emissions in 
agriculture have not been studied in detail. Some sources are difficult to quantify, others are 
53
 
    
hidden. In addition to significant climatic differences, there are also different types of soil in 
Slovakia. This affects the sowing process, manure application and farming.39 
The potential for reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions in  agriculture is  related to  manure 
management, in particular the handling and storage of manure and slurry, and a change of 
animal feed plans. The WEM scenario was modelled with the following measures: 
  Storage rules for organic fertilizers40  
This measure applies to N2O and NH3 emissions and has been in force since 2012. During 
the storage of slurry and other liquid organic fertilizers, it is necessary to ensure sufficient 
tank capacity with regard to the appropriate application time, tank surface coverage, e.g., 
floating covers of plastic films, covering the surface with straw or LECA material, if the 
surface is protected by natural bark, to limit handling operations to prevent damage. During 
the storage of solid organic fertilizers, it is especially necessary to ensure a reduction of the 
surface area, the covering of the surface, and the use of bioreactors. 
  
  The right feeding strategy41 
The protein content in the feed must correspond to the production level of animals, thus 
reducing the excess nitrogen content in the manure.  
The feeding strategy provides the most cost-effective options for reducing emissions, as it 
produces an effect at every stage where ammonia and N2O can be released.  
In particular, the following measures are recommended to reduce excess protein doses:   
• Adapt the composition of the feed to the requirements of the animals,  
• Replace a part of fresh grass with fibre of a lower protein content (e.g., maize silage).  
 
Emissions projections (Figure 16) from the Agricultural soil category were prepared using 
the WEM scenario (identical to the WAM scenario) and although they may differ from the 
actual figures achieved in the future due to a number of external factors (e.g., Common 
agricultural policy measures and many other factors - whether economic (supply, demand, 
agricultural input and output prices etc.), political or accidental (natural disasters, climate 
change, etc.), forecasts reflect current (2015) trends and expectations for the future. The 
development of the scenario by individual category is in Table 13 in Annex I.

39 More detailed information on the sector can be found in the National Inventory Reports of the Slovak Republic SR (NIR) 
on the website https://ghg-inventory.shmu.sk/documents.php

32 Technological equipment – Livestock production. 
41 Annex No. 7 to Regulation No. 410/2012 Coll. 
54
 
    
 
 
 
Based on the projections in the WEM reference scenario, it is clear that it is necessary to 
adopt  additional  measures  in  the  future  (identified  as  NEUTRAL  measures  as  the 
measures were not modelled in the WAM scenario) to reverse trends in emissions in 
which  agricultural  emissions  will  rise  slightly  in  the  future.  These  trends  are 
incompatible with Slovakia's target of achieving climate neutrality in 2050. 
2.5.4.3 ADDITIONAL  MEASURES  (NEUTRAL)  TO  ACHIEVE  THE  CLIMATE 
NEUTRALITY TARGET IN AGRICULTURE UP TO 2050 
In view of a slightly increasing trend in agricultural emissions over the last decade and 
projected for the following decades, it is necessary to increase the reduction effort, either 
by adopting new additional measures (NEUTRAL) or implementing already existing 
measures (some of which are also included in this list), and which are often adopted in 
other strategies but their implementation in practice is still insufficient in terms of 
contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In order to achieve climate 
neutrality,  it  will  be  desirable  to  effectively  set  up  a  long-term  and  predictable 
framework for financial support.   
 
 
 
  Support for the consistent implementation of the Code of Good Agricultural Practice. 
  Consistent implementation of measures identified in the Adaptation Strategy of the 
Slovak Republic on Adverse Impacts of Climate Change (rev 2017).42 While these 
measures  are  of  an  adaptation  nature,  they  have  great  mitigation  potential  in 
agriculture. These are, for example, the following measures (partly overlapping the 
LULUCF sector):  
-  Restoring degraded wetlands,

aktualizacia.pdf 
55
 
    
-  Managing changes in green cover due to climate change so that the development of 
erosion and desertification of the territory is reduced,  
-  Increasing landscape connectivity – building green infrastructure. 
  Reduce food losses and focus on maximising removals and minimising emissions for 
released land. 
  Precise farming (technology) can increase yields or reduce the farmed area, releasing 
land for alternative use. 
  Analysis and, where appropriate, subsequent implementation of agroforestry systems 
in land management. 
  Increased  use  of  nitrate-type  fertilizers  and  nitrogen-stabilized  fertilizers  to  the 
detriment of urea application. 
  Prepare a national analysis of N2O emissions, from the point of view of emission 
reductions of up to 40%.   
  Analyse the advantages and weaknesses of individual crops and their use in terms of 
greenhouse  gas  balance  and  biodiversity  impacts.  For  example,  crops  grown  for 
energy purposes (biofuel, biomass) are compared with other options (grass, forest, 
wetland, etc.).  
  Targeted boosting of self-sufficiency in food with a link to the preference of local 
foods, which often have a lower emission footprint (mainly due to transport). 
  Effectively  store  animal  waste,  namely  storing  liquids  in  tanks  isolated  from  the 
environment or tanks with oxygen access and storing livestock manure without or with 
a minimum amount of water to facilitate its handling so that it is stored under a roof 
with a concrete floor - this can eliminate up to 100% of N O emissions.  
2
  Efficiently process animal waste and use biogas, mainly as a local energy source. 
  Set rules for the operation of biogas plants in terms of processed input, including the 
storage of input material and digestate. 
  Animal feeding interventions to reduce CH  emissions such as intensive feeding on 
4
active substances, especially cereals. 
  Increased support for the bioeconomy. 
  Implementation of support from Pillar I and II of the Common Agricultural Policy 
aimed  at  improving  the  environment  and  climate  with  farmer  remuneration  for 
additional activities aimed at reducing emissions, or at increasing carbon sinks.  
  Pay attention to raising awareness and educating the population, prepare campaigns to 
change consumer behaviour, including a stronger emphasis on the carbon footprint of 
food and especially dairy products and certain types of meat.  
  Consider introducing a sectoral reduction target as part of updating this Strategy.

2.5.5  LAND USE, LAND USE CHANGE AND FORESTRY (LULUCF) SECTOR 
2.5.5.1 Current Emission and Removal Trends in the LULUCF Sector 
The  land  use,  land  use  change  and  forestry  (LULUCF)  sector  covers  a wide  range  of 
biological and technical processes in the country which also affect the amount of greenhouse 
gas emissions/removals. The emission inventory in this sector includes the main greenhouse 
gases (CO , CH  and N O) as well as basic pollutants from forest fires (NO   and CO). The 
2 4 2 x
LULUCF sector represents a net sink of CO  ranging from -10,987.61 (1992) to -5,719.15 
2
(2005) Gg CO  eq. over the period of 1990 – 2017 and the most important carbon sinks. The 
2
trend of GHG emissions/removals by the land use and harvested wood products category in 
the LULUCF sector is shown in Figure 17.  
Figure 17:  Trend of greenhouse gas emissions/removals in the LULUCF sector (Gg CO2eq.) 
in 1990-2017 (Gg CO2eq.) 
Forest land  Cropland  Grassland Settlements Other land  HWP 
Source:  SHMI 
Note: HWP stands for harvested wood products 
Net greenhouse gas emissions/sinks in the LULUCF sector are the result of changes in the 
different land use categories. For the FL (Forest land) category, the balance contains carbon 
stock in living biomass (aboveground and ground) and is based on the difference between the 
annual  increase  in  carbon  (total  current increase)  in  biomass  and  its  losses  (timber-
harvesting). In view of the fact that there are more and more biomass increases in Slovakia 
than those harvested, the balance is favourable, carbon stock in living biomass has been 
growing in recent years and this is also expected in the next decades (Figure 28 in Annex I). 
The temporary decrease in removals is caused by a gradual increase in the average age of 
forest  stands  and  a  resulting  lower  year-on-year  increase  in  wood  mass.  Healthy  forest 
ecosystems have a high carbon storage capacity. 
57
 
    
 
2.5.5.2 Projections of emissions and removals under the WEM reference scenario 
The projections of emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector were based on the Sectoral 
Strategy Paper the Rural Development Programme of the Slovak Republic 2007 – 2013 and 
2014 – 2020, taking into account the adopted National Forest Programme (NLP) of the Slovak 
Republic as well as the NLP Action Plans for 2009 – 2013 and 2015 – 2020.  
The following measures were included in the projections of greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals in the LULUCF sector:  
  Afforestation of 800 ha of low-productive/low reclaimed land with fast growing trees 
and the first afforestation of 600 ha of agricultural land by 2017;  
  Grassing of 50,000 ha of arable land by 2017; 
  Reduction of the risk of forest fires to 90% compared to the period of 2000 – 2003 
(application of Regulation 2152/2003/EC concerning the monitoring of forests and 
forest fires),   
Figure 18: Projections of CO  (Gg) emissions/removals in the Land use, land use change 
2 eq
and forestry (LULUCF) sector until 2040 under the WEM scenario 
 
 
 
The results of the modelling of projected CO  emissions/removals from the LULUCF sector 
2
for the period until 2040 are shown in Figure 42. As can be seen, overall CO  removals in the 
2
sector are expected to range from –6,642.32 (2017) to – 4,206.56 (2035) Gg CO . The 
2
projections of CO  removals in the period between 2017 and 2035 show a decreasing trend. 
2
This is mainly due to a decrease in removals in the categories FL (Forest land), CL (Cropland) 
and GL (Grassland) and an increase in emissions from SL (Settlements) and OL (Other land). 
58
 
    
After 2035, removals are expected to increase in the FL (Forest land) and GL (Grassland) 
categories. These trends can be seen in Table 14 in Annex I.  
The LULUCF sector plays an important role in removing those emissions that cannot 
otherwise be eliminated (emissions from industrial processes, agricultural activities and 
transport) and, on the other hand, the use of wood in the material and energy sectors 
will replace the use of fossil-based products and raw materials. Thus, the sector provides 
opportunities for emission reductions that will not be eliminated otherwise, and which 
could jeopardize the achievement of the climate neutrality target in 2050. However, the 
development as from 1990 as well as projections (Figure 15) for the future show quite 
the opposite trend (a reduction of such removals). It will therefore be necessary to 
quantify and assess the potential for CO2 removals in the LULUCF sector and their 
possible application to reduce the emission residue (Chapter 2.1.1) by 2050 through 
additional measures. On the other hand, the sector is vulnerable to the damage caused 
by the effects of climate change (drought, higher temperatures, wind, fires, pathogens, 
etc.) that reduce CO2 removals.  
2.5.5.3 Possibilities of Increasing Removals of LULUCF Sector under the WAM Scenario 
The Scenario with additional measures (WAM) shows the trend of emissions after two other 
additional measures have been implemented: 
-  Afforestation of 23,000 ha of grassland by 2040 
-  Grassing of 50,000 ha of cropland after 2016. 
Based on this assumption (Figure 19), projected CO  removals in the period between 2017 
2
and 2035 show a downward trend. As can be seen, overall CO  removals in the sector are 
2
expected to range from –6,642.32 (2017) to – 4,272.30 (2035) Gg CO . This is mainly due to 
2
a decrease in removals in the categories FL (Forest land), CL (Cropland) and GL (Grassland) 
and an increase in emissions from SL and OL. After 2035, removals are expected to increase 
in the FL and GL categories. More detailed information can be found in Table 15 in Annex I.

Slovakia has not yet quantified emissions/removals from the Wetland category as there is no 
sufficiently accurate input data based on which it is possible to model emission/removal 
projections in this category.  
 
2.5.5.4 OTHER ADDITIONAL MEASURES (NEUTRAL) IN THE LULUCF SECTOR TO 
ACHIEVE THE CLIMATE NEUTRALITY TARGET BY 2050 
The scenarios highlighted the need to strengthen efforts in the LULUCF sector through 
the  introduction  of  new  NEUTRAL  measures  and  the  implementation  of  existing 
measures, including those used in the WAM scenario, which are often adopted in other 
strategies (e.g., the Adaptation Strategy) but their implementation in practice is still 
insufficient in terms of increasing removals. Moreover, it will be necessary to quantify 
and evaluate the potential for CO  removals in the LULUCF sector and their possible 
2
application  to  reduce  the  emission  residue  by  2050  through  additional  measures. 
Support for increasing removals will be implemented in the short term mainly through 
the  Common  Agricultural  Policy  and  through  adaptation  measures  under  the  2nd 
Program  Priority  in  Slovakia  financed  from  the  EU  budget.  However,  in  order  to 
achieve climate neutrality, it will be desirable to effectively set up a long-term and 
predictable framework for financial support.  
 
 
  Introduce sustainability criteria for forest biomass according to the Directive on the 
promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. 43 
  Increase  forest  area  through  afforestation  of  agriculturally   unused  land  while 
maintaining the diversity of non-forest habitats.

  Maintain vital forests by limiting the negative impacts of climate change on forests 
through  measures  focused  on  forest  adaptation  (supporting  the  application  of 
management models beyond the scope of legal obligations, supporting the use of 
alternative management models for the purpose of modifying the woody composition, 
using appropriate provenance).   
  Maintain vital forests by limiting the negative impacts of climate change on forests by 
implementing preventive and protective measures against the spread of disturbances. 
  In  the  context  of  sustainable  forest  management,  support  measures  focused  on 
increasing carbon removals. Apply nature-friendly management from the third degree 
of nature protection and higher. 
  Implement measures to significantly  reduce the share of  accidental  felling in  the 
forests of the SR. 
  Preserve and ensure the protection of primaeval forests and natural forests in the 
context  of  the  overall  implementation  of  the  concept  of  sustainable  forest 
management. 
  Use agro-forestry systems aimed at carbon sequestration through wood biomass and 
soil.  
  Utilise record-keeping, quantification and active management of biomass on non-
forest land.  
  Gradually  increase  the  area  of  forest  land  or  agroforestry  land  by  addressing 
discrepancies in land types through land consolidation projects and partial changes to 
non-forest lands overgrown with forest trees. 
  Increase the share of wood products (HWP) with long lifetimes, including for building 
purposes.  
  Implement measures aimed at increasing carbon sequestration in agricultural soils and 
maintaining a high level of organic carbon in carbon-rich soils. 
  Increase the organic carbon content in agricultural soils by ensuring land management 
with the principles of good agricultural practice as well as by meeting the general 
requirements  under  Article  8  of  Regulation of  the  Government  of  the  SR  No. 
342/2014 Coll. of 2015, which lays down the rules for granting support in agriculture 
in  connection  with  decoupled  direct  payment  schemes  (crop  diversification, 
maintaining existing permanent grassland, having an ecological focus area). 
  Maintain and restore grassland. 
  Protect and restore peatlands and wetlands in river basins. 
  Recognise the need for education, awareness-raising and awareness for the general 
public for additional measures in this sector.  
  Prepare a study to assess the possibilities for achieving 7 Mt CO2 eq. and more from 
the LULUCF sector by 2050.

2.5.6  WASTE SECTOR 
2.5.6.1 Current Trends in Reducing Emissions in the Waste Sector 
The emission inventory for the waste sector includes direct greenhouse gas emissions (CH , 
4
CO ,  N O)  and  indirect  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (NMVOC).  Methane  emissions  are 
2 2
generated at solid waste disposal sites, the sites of biodegradable waste recovery, waste 
incineration  and  in  wastewater  treatment  processes.  The  main  source  of  CO   is  waste 
2
incineration. N O arises from biological waste treatment and wastewater treatment.  
2
Total emissions from the waste sector are relatively stable over the period 1990 -2016, as 
shown in Figure 20.

(Gg CO2eq.) – by category 
 
Landfilling Biological treatment of solid waste Waste Incineration Wastewater treatment 
Source: SHMI 
Total CO  eq. emissions in 2016 were 1,483.80 Gg, an increase of 11% compared to 1990, 
2
and a drop by 3% compared to 2015 due to a decrease in biologically treated waste and waste 
incineration. The increase in emissions from waste disposal was offset by a reduction in 
emissions  from  wastewater  treatment,  while  biological  wastewater  treatment  and waste 
incineration had a minor impact on the overall balance of the sector. 44 
                                                 
44 44 More detailed information on the sector can be found in the inventory reports (NIR) on the website https://ghg-
inventory.shmu.sk/documents.php 
62
 
    
2.5.6.2 Projections of emissions under the WEM reference scenario (identical to the WAM 
scenario) 
The projections of emissions from the waste sector until 2040 concentrate on activities in the 
areas of municipal waste management and municipal wastewater treatment. These two main 
sources of emissions account for more than 80% of the estimated emissions in the waste 
sector.  
The reference scenario (WEM) is based on the expectation that development in municipal 
waste  management  will  continue  as  observed  in  the  last  decade.  This  development  is 
characterized  by  organization  of  waste  collection  at  the  municipal  level  and  increasing 
separation of recyclables or waste components, maintaining landfilling as the main waste 
disposal  method. This  development  relies on the Waste Management  Programme of the 
Slovak Republic for the years 2019 – 202545. The WEM/WAM scenario relies on measures 
from the Programme or other assumptions:   
  Reduction of mixed municipal waste by 50% until 2025 compared to 2016; 
  Reduction  of  biodegradable  waste  in  mixed  municipal  waste  by  60%  until  2025 
compared to the status in 2016. 
  Reduction of municipal waste landfilling to a maximum of 10% until 2035. 
  It is assumed that to achieve the targets above, the two incinerators (Košice and 
Bratislava) will continue their operations in this scenario at their current capacity (200 
kt/year). 
When  evaluating  specific  measures  for  the  continued implementation  of  the  targets  and 
measures of the Waste Management Programme of the Slovak Republic for 2016 – 2020, it 
was found that most of the original targets have not been achieved46. In order to achieve the 
above stated  targets, it  is  expected that the existing incineration plants will continue to 
increase their operation to full capacity, i.e. 285 kt/year.

Slovak Republic for 2016 – 2020 https://rokovania.gov.sk/RVL/Material/23377/1  
63
 
    
 
 
Based on the projections in the WEM reference scenario, which are identical to the 
WAM scenario, it is clear that the trend of waste emissions is  moving in the right 
direction. The risk is related to the implementation of all modelled measures in force 
(waste  legislation  with  targets)  because  the  targets  have  not  been  met  in  the  past. 
Therefore, additional measures (NEUTRAL) need to be taken in the future so that the 
trend  of  emissions  copies  the  projections  and  that  reductions  beyond  the  scope  of 
projections are increased for the sector to be able to contribute as much as possible to 
achieving climate neutrality for the Slovak Republic by 2050. 
 
2.5.6.3 OTHER ADDITIONAL MEASURES (NEUTRAL) IN THE WASTE SECTOR TO 
ACHIEVE THE CLIMATE NEUTRALITY TARGET UP TO 2050 
For  this  sector  to  contribute  effectively  to  the  2050  climate  neutrality  target,  it  is 
necessary  to  increase  the  reduction  effort  by  adopting  new  additional  measures 
(NEUTRAL) and implementing already existing measures, some of which are often 
adopted  in  other  strategies,  programmes  and  plans  (e.g.,  the  Waste  Management 
Programme of the Slovak Republic) but their implementation in practice still has a 
lot of room  for  improvement  from  the  point  of  view  of  contributing  to  reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions. In order to achieve climate neutrality, it will be desirable to 
effectively set up a long-term and predictable framework for financial support. 
 
  Increased support for the circular economy through: 
-  Ecodesign  focusing  on  reuse,  durability,  recyclability,  recycled  material  content, 
reparability;  
-  Measures to increase resource efficiency;  
-  Encourage  the  emergence  of  new  business  models  based  on  sharing,  lending  or 
repairing; 
64
 
    
-  Reduce food waste (e.g., food products can be further used, either by donating safe 
food products or food products past their expiry date to a charity, or by composting or 
recovering products for energy or otherwise)  
-  Waste prevention; 
-  Establish the obligation to use certified products from recycling where there is an 
equivalent to non-renewable raw material products (e.g., at least a 30% share); 
-  Establish  the  obligation  to  reuse  purified  water  from wastewater  treatment plants, 
purified process water mainly for energy use – water vapour applications. 
  Streamline the prevention of illegal dumps. 
  Improve separate collection of biodegradable municipal waste for the production of 
biogas from waste (e.g., biodegradable waste and waste from wastewater treatment 
plants) with regard to the use of digestate for land, its subsequent transformation into 
biogas / biomethane (e.g., for its subsequent use in transport or injection into the 
distribution  system)  and  the  production  of  electricity  and  heat  from  biogas  / 
biomethane. 
  Support  SMART  solutions  for  technical  services  in  towns  to  streamline  waste 
management.  
  Optimize waste management logistics at the level of cities and municipalities. 
  Recognise the need for education, awareness-raising and awareness for the general 
public for additional measures in this sector.  
  Consider introducing a reduction target for the whole waste sector (whether for 2030, 
2040 or 2050) as part of updating this Strategy which would be in harmony with the 
2050 climate neutrality target.

3  CURRENT AND PLANNED FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
THE PROPOSED MEASURES 
 
3.1 Estimated Investments Required for Decarbonisation  
 
If Slovakia decarbonises its economy as it was modelled in the scenario with additional 
measures WAM  from  the WB (i.e. by 2030,  there would be  a 47%  reduction in  total 
emissions compared to 1990 levels and 70% in 2050 according to the WB conservative 
estimate), by 2030 it will cost an extra EUR 8 billion over the decade, and in 2031-2050 
(i.e. two decades) it will even be an extra EUR 196 billion compared to the WEM reference 
scenario. Thus, by 2040 the average additional annual expenditure will be 1.8% of GDP, in 
2020-2050 it will be up to 4.2% of GDP47 on average per annum. 
 
These costs include investments that will be made by households, the business sector and the 
state. For example, in 2030, households will invest an extra EUR one billion per year for 
thermal insulation, the purchase of more environmentally-sound appliances, or the use of 
renewable energy sources. Likewise, in the third sector, an essential part of which is buildings 
and  services,  investments  will  be  made  for  insulation  and  the  application  of  measures 
according to the Ecodesign Directive, which will mean an investment of almost EUR 1 
billion in 2030.  
Slovakia has a higher decarbonisation target than was modelled in the WAM scenario, 
which is to achieve climate neutrality in 2050, meaning reductions of at least 90% 
compared  to  1990  levels  (excluding  removals).  This  would  imply  that  the  cost  of 
decarbonisation would be considerably higher than those calculated in this strategy. We 
do not have this data available. However, the models used did not assume this scenario and 
it is one of the tasks that must be dealt with when updating this strategy in the future.   
 
The partially quantified amounts needed for decarbonisation should also have adequately 
allocated funds. According to recent developments, it is clear that the higher cost of 
decarbonisation  will  in  future  be  partly  offset  by  the  higher  amounts  of  funding 
available for it.  
  
Based on internal estimates of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic in cooperation 
with the Permanent Representation of the Slovak Republic to the EU and MoE SR estimates, 
between EUR 9.9 and 10.5 billion should be available before 2030 for climatic measures 
                                                 
47 The projected costs are calculated on the basis of the prices of existing technologies (electric arc, synthetic fuels, battery 
repositories) and it is expected that they will be cheaper, but not as a result of a sudden reduction in prices due to the 
discovery of new technology.  
66
 
    
through the EU budget (the figure only covers the period until 2027), the Modernisation 
Fund and the Environmental Fund (both the Funds cover the period between 2020 and 
2030). This figure did not include possible additional funds for projects drawn from the 
Innovation  Fund,  from  the  European  Economic  Area  Financial  Mechanism  and  the 
Norwegian Financial Mechanism and did not take into account other sources within the SR 
budget in the period between 2028 and 2030. Nevertheless, this figure exceeds the estimated 
additional cost of WB modelling by 2030 by EUR 2.5 billion.  
 
In the long term, according to internal estimates of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak 
Republic in cooperation with the Permanent Representation of the Slovak Republic to 
the EU, the SR will have EUR 42 to 45 billion available between 2027 and 2050 for 
climate change measures just from the EU budget, where other national and European 
funds are not taken into account.  
It  is  questionable whether  State  and  public authorities  are  ready  to  use  such  huge 
financial resources intended for decarbonisation projects which should be in line with 
the goals of achieving climate neutrality in 2050. This issue should also be analysed 
during the update of this strategy.  
  
3.2  Planned Financing Opportunities for Mitigation and Adaptation Measures 
After 2020 
Since it is a long-term strategic document, the current sources of funding available at the time 
of the adoption of this Strategy in this context will not take into account post-2020 realities. 
Details on the current way of financing decarbonisation measures until 2030 are stated in 
Chapter 3.1.1 of the NECP. It contains information about current EU funding sources, other 
funding sources such as SlovSEFF III and about State aid schemes.    
 
In order to achieve the targets set, it is also necessary to create support mechanisms to finance 
individual measures. The Strategy identified 6 priority financial instruments (other than 
the SR budget) ensuring the transition to a low-carbon economy:  
1.  Modernisation Fund 
2.  Innovation Fund  
3.  EU budget (European Structural and Investment Funds) 
4.  Other funds from abroad provided under contracts 
5.  Environmental Fund 
6.  European Green Deal Investment Plan 
 
Under these financial instruments, significant funds of EUR 9.9 billion to EUR 10.5 billion 
could be earmarked for climate change for the next 10 years. 
 
Another important area of financing for climate measures will be State and local authorities’ 
budgets.  Mitigation  and  adaptation  measures  must  also  be  funded  from  the  central 
government, regional and local governments’ own resources, regardless of the availability of 
67
 
    
other sources, in the implementation of their own departmental measures which are either 
based on or in line with this Strategy. In implementing their own measures and priority areas, 
ministries  and  other  public  authorities  often  also  implement  measures  in  line  with  this 
Strategy, either directly or indirectly.  
3.2.1  Modernisation Fund 
The Modernisation Fund is set up under Article 10d of the revised ETS Directive and will 
serve  to  encourage  investment  in  modernising energy  systems  and  improving  energy 
efficiency. The investments supported must be in line with the objectives of the Directive 
(reducing greenhouse gas emissions) and in accordance with State Aid Guidelines. 
Projects applying for support from the Modernisation Fund can be divided into priority and 
non-priority projects. Priority projects include:  
  Investments in the generation and use of electricity from renewable sources, 
  The improvement of energy efficiency, except energy efficiency relating to energy 
generation using solid fossil fuels, 
  Energy storage, 
  The modernisation of energy networks, including district heating pipelines, 
  Investments  and  the  modernisation  of  grids  for  electricity  transmission  and  the 
increase of interconnections between Member States, 
  Investments in energy efficiency in transport, building industry, agriculture and waste 
management; and 
  Promoting fair transition in coal-dependent regions. 
The percentage of the allowances for the SR in the Modernisation Fund is 6.13%. According 
to the ETS Directive, the SR will transfer 30% from its total share of allowance auctions to 
the Modernisation Fund. This will additionally increase the quantity of allowances from 19 
mil.  allowances to  roughly  54 mil.  allowances during  the 10-year period  of 2021-2030, 
ensuring a financing package of around EUR 1.35 billion for Slovakia in that period at 
the average price of 25 EUR/allowance. 
 
3.2.2  Innovation Fund 
The Innovation Fund is a pan-European fund and will be financed from the auctioning 
of 450 million EU Emissions and from the funds, if any, that will be left after the end of the 
NER  300  programme.  On  the  basis  of  preliminary  estimates,  such  auctioning  could 
accumulate between EUR 3 and 11 billion, depending on the selling price of the emission 
allowances, and will be available to all entities within the EU. 
The Innovation Fund will be built on similar principles to the NER 300 programme. However, 
the biggest difference is the extension of supported investment plans to include carbon capture 
and utilisation technologies, innovative low-carbon technologies in the industry, and energy 
storage technologies. 
 
68
 
    
3.2.3  EU Budget (European Structural and Investment Funds)  
Within the Union's budget for the years 2021-2027, it is possible to make use of financial 
resources  from  individual  EU  structural  and  investment  funds  (the  European Fund 
for Reconstruction and Development, Cohesion Fund, European Social Fund, Horizon, LIFE, 
CEF, InvestEU, Just Transition Fund, BICC) as well as from the Common Agricultural 
Policy, where climate change and environmental expenditure should account for up to 40%. 
From the entire budget, up to 25% of expenditure should go for climate change. At 
present there have been discussions on the final form of the multiannual financial framework 
(MFF) for 2021-2027, with individual Member States including Slovakia already working on 
their national Programme Priorities. 
 
If measures to combat climate change become a strategic priority for the SR, in the 
years 2021-2027 the Slovak Republic can use EUR 7.6 to 8.1 billion for this purpose in 
combination with EU funds and related national co-financing.48 Fighting climate change 
will  be  priority  for  the  EU  and  the  EC  will  prefer  such  projects  to  other  projects  in 
negotiations with Slovakia. The EU precondition will be that the SR invests at least EUR 6.5 
billion (25% of the funds from the EU budget which SK will receive in 2021-27) in measures 
to combat climate change. Adding mandatory national co-financing, we get EUR 7.6 billion 
for the conservative scenario and EUR 8.1 billion for the optimistic scenario.  
 
By 2050, the SR's receipts from the EU budget will have gradually declined, but the per 
cent share of the mandatory funds for combating climate change will have increased. At 
the beginning of 2020, it can be assumed that in the period between 2021 and 2050, 
Slovakia will have EUR 49.5 to 53 billion available for measures to combat climate change 
(the sum of gradually declining revenue from the EU budget, whereas the % focus for that 
purpose will grow and growing mandatory co-financing from the EU budget). This is the sum 
of likely revenue from the EU budget through the cohesion policy and rural development and 
their national co-financing, which SK is likely to receive from the EU budget in 2021-2050 
for measures to combat climate change. 
Within the main programme priorities in Slovakia being prepared for the upcoming MFF by 
2027,  priority  2:  A  GREENER, low-carbon  EUROPE  relates  to  climate  change 
through promoting clean and fair energy transition, green and blue investment, the circular 
economy, climate adaptation and risk prevention and management. 
Within this priority, Slovakia plans to focus on addressing mitigation and adaptation issues 
with the following support: 
  Support for measures to reduce the energy performance of buildings 
  Promoting renewable energy sources and efficient district heating systems (DHS) in 
the areas of heat and cold supply and smart energy systems, energy storage 
  Promoting and using alternative fuels in transport 
                                                 
48 An internal estimate of the Ministry of Finance in cooperation with the Permanent Representation of the SR to the EU  
69
 
    
  Water  management  and  retention  capacity  of  the  landscape  and  settlement 
environment 
  Preventive measures to protect against emergencies associated with climate change 
  Supporting  the  adaptation  process  by  improving  data  availability,  supporting  the 
creation of strategy papers and raising public awareness 
 
Support  for  increasing  removals  will  be  implemented  mainly  through  the  Common 
Agricultural Policy and partly through adaptation measures under the 2nd Programme Priority 
in Slovakia financed from the EU budget.  
3.2.4  Environmental Fund  
The Environmental Fund will play an important role through which mitigation measures will 
be financed further to help the transition to a low-carbon economy in Slovakia.  
The  Environmental  Fund  is  the  recipient  of  revenues  from  the  sale  of  emission 
allowances by auction. Starting from 2020, the share will be higher, whereas according to the 
national legislation it cannot be less than 30%.  This will ensure possible spending on 
climate and environmental projects for the next period in the amount of roughly EUR 1 
billion.  
This change will facilitate better investment predictability and better planning for the use of 
Environmental Fund funding.  Revenue  from  the Environmental Fund will be reused for 
investment that contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This arrangement also 
pursues the implementation of ETS Directive provisions that at least 50% of revenues should 
be used to reduce emissions and mitigate the consequences of climate change, either at the 
national level or through aid to developing countries. However, Slovakia has not fulfilled this 
condition yet. 
 
 
3.2.5  Other Funds from abroad Provided under Contracts 
This means the European Economic Area Financial Mechanism and the Norwegian Financial 
Mechanism, through which both decarbonisation and adaptation projects in Slovakia have 
been financed. It is expected that the funds will continue to finance such projects after 2020.  
 
3.2.6  European Green Deal Investment Plan 
During the last stage of the preparation of this strategic document on 14 January 2020, the 
European Commission published the "EU Green Deal: Sustainable Europe Investment Plan" 
on financing low-carbon transformation by 2030.  It should cover expenses for measures 
presented in the EC programme entitled the European Green Deal and should have at least 
EUR 1,000 billion (EUR 1 trillion) available. It will be a combination of mainly European 
(the EU budget and EIB loans) but also of national public and private funds. The core of 
the proposal is the so-called Just Transition Mechanism (EUR 100 billion), built on 3 pillars:  
70
 
    
1.  Pillar – a just transition fund in the amount of EUR 30-50 billion. An allocation of 
about EUR 160 million is assumed for SK. The allocation has already been included in the 
above-stated estimates for the amount of funding available for climate action from the EU 
budget.  
2.  Pillar – a dedicated scheme under InvestEU in the amount of EUR 45 billion.  
3.  Pillar – a new programme that uses EIB Loan Facilities in the amount of EUR 25-30 
billion.  
 
The scope of support from the Just Transition Fund basically copies the relevant activities 
that are already part of the support of the current cohesion policy. The EC will bind countries 
to a compulsory transfer from European Structural and Investment Funds of 1.5 to 3 times 
their national allocation to the Fund (160 million). Support from this new fund should focus in 
particular on: 
 (1) Phasing out extraction and production of coal, lignite, peat and shale oil and the related 
impact on unemployment; 
 (2)  The  introduction  of  new  technologies,  processes  and  products  in  sectors  with  high 
greenhouse gas production, resulting in a significant reduction in greenhouse gas levels;  
(3) Promoting innovation and sustainable technology research;  
(4) Up-skilling and re-skilling workers affected by low-carbon transformation.

4  ANALYSES OF THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL ECONOMIC ASPECTS 
OF PROPOSED POLICIES AND MEASURES  
At the beginning, Slovakia reduced greenhouse gas emissions through relatively simple and 
often  inexpensive  measures.  This  was  also  due  to  the  restructuring  of  enterprises  that 
introduced relatively clean technology (e.g., switching from coal to gas), the introduction of 
which resulted from the membership of the Slovak Republic in the EU. However, cheap 
technology is now depleted, and further emission reductions will require significant funding. 
Such a low-carbon transformation will therefore require large investment costs on the one 
hand, but will also bring new economic benefits (green jobs, new sectors) and sustainability to 
the levels of economic growth on the other hand (decarbonisation based on WAM scenario 
impact modelling should bring GDP growth in the long term). Green jobs mean mainly new 
jobs created in the housing, building, agriculture and forestry sectors (in terms of nature 
conservation and biomass use, as well as jobs in the electricity, heat production and new 
economy sectors).  
If Slovakia decarbonises its economy  as was  modelled in  the  scenario  with additional 
measures WAM  from  the WB (i.e. by 2030,  there would be  a 47%  reduction in  total 
emissions compared to 1990 levels and 70% in 2050 according to the WB conservative 
estimate), projected costs by 2030 are roughly an extra EUR 8 billion over the decade, and 
in 2031-2050, it will even be an extra EUR 196 billion compared to the WEM reference 
scenario. Thus, by 2040 the average additional annual expenditure will be 1.8% of GDP, in 
2020-2050 it will account for 4.2% of GDP on average per annum49 (Figure 22). 
The costs of implementing the low-carbon scenario will have increased only slightly by 2030, 
however, they will have grown considerably by 2050 mainly due to higher investment in the 
field of energy efficiency and the transition to new technologies compared to the baseline 
scenario. In order to achieve the objectives, the energy sectors have to incur additional costs 
in the field of electrification, thermal insulation, the transition to cleaner technologies or the 
use of the best available technologies. All these costs are then divided through the model 
among the individual consumer industries that relate to the energy part of the economy: 
industry, households, the third sector (services) and transport (i.e. the industrial processes, 
agriculture, fugitive emissions and waste sectors are not counted).  
For example, households will invest an extra EUR billion per year in 2030 (Figure 23) e.g. 
for thermal insulation, the purchase of more energy-efficient electrical appliances or the use 
of renewable energy sources. In 2050 it will be up to 8 billion. Equally, in the third sector, of 
which buildings and services are an important part, investments will be made for thermal 
insulation and the implementation of measures under the Ecodesign Directive, which in 2030 
                                                 
49 The projected costs are calculated on the basis of the prices of existing technologies (electric arc, synthetic fuels, battery 
repositories) and it is expected that they will be cheaper, but not as a result of a sudden reduction in prices due to the 
discovery of new technology. These costs relate only to the energy part of the economy: industry, households, the third 
sector (services) and transport (i.e. the industrial processes, agriculture, fugitive emissions and waste sectors are not 
counted). 
73
 
    
will mean an investment of almost EUR 1 billion. In addition, there are also positive effects 
where, as a result of the electrification and modernization of transport, all sectors (as shown 
in Figure 23) will save more than half a billion euros on fuels and in 2050 almost EUR 2 
billion.

Slovakia has a higher decarbonisation target than was modelled in the WAM scenario: 
to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. This would imply reductions of at least 90% 
compared to 1990 levels (excluding removals). The cost of decarbonisation would be 
considerably higher than those calculated in this strategy. We do not have this data 
available. However, the models used did not assume this scenario and it is one of the tasks 
that must be dealt with when updating this strategy in the future. 
 
4.1  Detailed Analysis of the Effects of the Measures under the WAM Scenario 
 
The transition to a low-carbon economy may potentially support GDP growth in the long 
term but on the other hand, may lead to lower household consumption. 
Based on the results of the WAM scenario, in 2025-2035 GDP growth is expected to be 
around 0.5 - 1.0% compared to the reference scenario, and 3-4% in the 2040-2050 period. 
What is important is that GDP will also increase in the reference scenario (in the amount of 
2.7%  in  2030  up  to  0.6%  in  2050)  (Figure  24).  Furthermore,  the  model  shows  a 
decrease in household consumption in the period of 2025-2035 by 0.7 - 1.02% and by 5-6% in 
2040-2050.  
 
Towards 2050, investments in electricity generation will continue increasing as Slovakia is 
building new electricity generation capacities. Exports will decrease due to the loss of 
competitiveness as the cost of investments in efficiency is passed on to consumers, also 
because of the lower production capacity of the economy due to a lower core capital. What is 
important is that the macroeconomic impact on Slovakia is due not only to its domestic 
policies, but more than half of the decline in consumption is due to decarbonisation 
75
 
    
policies in the rest of the EU (a carbon tax in both the ETS and non-ETS sectors). Policies in 
the rest of the EU will lead to lower imports from Slovakia.  
 
Reduced  demand  for  fossil  fuels  will  decrease  Slovakia's  import  costs,  but  trade 
conditions will also be deteriorating. As a result, the imports will drop while exports 
grow. An increase in net exports with respect to the deterioration of trade conditions will 
'consume' GDP profits stemming from productivity improvements (energy efficiency) and 
contribute to a drop of private consumption. An open question at the EU level remains 
to address measures to maintain the competitiveness of EU exporters to third countries. 
The transformation towards a low-carbon economy will lead to lower collection of revenue 
from  indirect  taxation  (e.g.,  VAT)  and  direct  taxation  (including  social  security 
payments). The collection of revenue from indirect taxation will drop due to lower household 
consumption, while revenue from direct taxation will fall due to lower wages.  
 
Significant investments in energy efficiency in businesses and households will be needed 
to achieve reduced energy demand. In industry, for instance in heavy industrial production, 
this  will  involve focusing on best available techniques  by investing in heat recovery, 
processing  and  new  equipment.  In  the  service  sector,  this  will  mainly  involve  the 
renovation of buildings (i.e. better insulation). Households will perform major renovations 
of buildings to meet the 2030 targets, while in the post-2030 period a strong emergence of 
electric cars and fuel cell cars replacing combustion engine cars is expected.  
 
Households  will  effectively  finance  the  renovation  of  their  homes  by  reducing 
consumption. Households will also experience the costs of electrification in the transport 
sector, but this will not directly lead to a reduction in consumption. Households will prefer 
replacing their combustion engine cars with either electric cars or fuel cell cars (alternative 
fuels).  However,  households  will  also  be  affected  by  higher  prices  transferred  by 
businesses for the purposes of reimbursing the costs of energy efficiency investments. Taking 
into account the social impact of these measures on households, measures will need to be 
taken in accordance with the principles of equalization and distributive justice in order 
to prevent households falling into the energy poverty trap. The NECP addresses this issue 
in more detail.50 
 
Decarbonisation will weaken some sectors of the heavy manufacturing industry, such as 
the chemicals, rubber and plastics, and iron and steel sectors. The iron and steel industry 
will experience high extra investment costs, leading to significant price increases and oil 
refineries will face lower demand for oil fuels. On the other hand, in other cases – mainly in 
the ferrous heavy metals sector – the costs of the energy system will actually fall due to 
decarbonisation policies, leading to lower prices and an increase in overall production. The 
production  of  motor  vehicles  will  remain  important  in  the  Slovak  economy  in  all  four 
scenarios. An implicit assumption is that the Slovak motor vehicle manufacturing industry 
                                                 
50 Specifically, Chapter 2.4.4 of the NECP. 
76
 
    
will move towards the manufacture of electric vehicles or alternatively fuelled vehicles in line 
with demand.  
The model has shown that there will be heavy investments in building renovation and the 
building sector will grow. Construction will be driven by the renovation of buildings by both 
households and businesses.  
 
Changes in the structure of the economy's industry will lead to a redistribution of the 
workforce  across  different  sectors,  taking  into  account  the  ageing  factor  of  the 
population. Some sectors will grow, such as mainly services and export-oriented industry 
and sectors supplying goods, and will recruit additional workforce. This will also create 
potential for the emergence of so-called green jobs (jobs related to new activities concerning 
electromobility and alternatively fuelled vehicles, increasing EE and a higher use RES). On 
the  contrary,  some  sectors  will  decline,  such  as  the  main  industries  manufacturing 
consumer  goods,  and  will  dismiss  workers.  However,  not  all  employees  who  become 
redundant will be able to find a job, leading to a rise in unemployment (Figure 25). The 
downward pressure on wages will increase as we approach 2050 (Figure 26). The solution 
to this situation will require the preparation of social projects by the state in cooperation with 
the education sector to ensure the adaptation of the vacant labour force to new labour market 
requirements and projects to ensure the elimination of social impacts on members of the 
labour force who do not find a job within a reasonable time. 
 
Taking into account the results of empirical research on energy poverty51 in the Slovak 
context,  the  transformation  to  a  low-carbon  economy  will  especially  need  to  take  into 
account marginalized Roma communities, pensioners, the unemployed, large families with 
children, families with  lone parents and persons living in leased flats on the commercial 
market. The issue of energy poverty will need to be addressed comprehensively and in a 
cross-cutting context in the conditions of social policy and related topics (affordable and high-
quality) housing, energy prices, financial literacy, education and employment. On the other 
hand, it will also be necessary to deepen the strategic planning of options to ensure human 
resources,  in  particular  a  skilled  workforce  to  achieve  the  transformation towards  a low-
carbon economy. 
 
A  poorly  controlled  and  insufficiently  regulated  transformation towards  a low-carbon 
economy bears the risk of the situation deteriorating in the area of economic and social rights, 
the guarantee of which is, inter alia, a prerequisite for the effective exercise of civil and 
political rights. Guaranteeing rights results, inter alia, from the international commitments of 
the Slovak Republic and it is reasonable to assume that their consistent implementation in the 
long term in the context of unprecedented economic and social transformation will require the 
ability to react in a preventive, flexible, targeted and innovative way. Adequate action to

CONCLUSION 
Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of the 21st century. Climate change solutions 
entail economic and social costs which will ultimately bring benefits in all areas of life as they 
aim to prevent a climate crisis to the extent that could mean the destruction of society and life 
as we know it today.  
The strategy is  a cross-cutting document across all sectors of the economy which must 
implement  individual  policies  to  complement  each  other  towards  the  fulfilment  of  the 
common goal of completely decarbonising Slovakia by the middle of this century (to achieve 
climate neutrality).  
 
This ambitious goal was set by Slovakia only at the final stage of the preparation of this 
strategy (when modelling had already been completed), and therefore the less ambitious 
emission reduction (and increases in removals) scenarios entitled WEM and WAM will not 
get us to climate neutrality alone, as pointed out in this document.  
 
For these reasons, the strategy proposes additional measures (entitled NEUTRAL) which 
should move us closer to the objective of achieving climate neutrality. These additional 
NEUTRAL measures and their impact have not yet been modelled in the study or strategy, 
and this will be a task that will have to be addressed so that they are part of the strategy at the 
next update (with the adoption of an updated strategy no later than five years), including their 
social economic impacts. It will also be necessary to update the WEM and WAM reduction 
scenarios to reflect the current political-legal status. Another issue that should be analysed 
during the update of this strategy is the readiness of state and public authorities to use 
increasing funding intended for decarbonisation projects in the long term.  
 
In the meantime, in a move closer to Slovakia’s common goal of achieving climate neutrality 
in  2050,  all  identified  measures  in  the  WEM  and  WAM  scenarios  will  have  to  be 
implemented horizontally across all sectors and other NEUTRAL additional measures will 
have to be adopted and implemented. All identified emission sectors must contribute to this 
effort because, as described in the sectoral chapters, either some of them must increase their 
reduction efforts as emissions have not declined for the last decade and the trend must be 
reversed (transport, agriculture), the national ETS target must be achieved by 2030, the total 
modelled emissions in these sectors are higher than the target emission gap that may be 
emitted in 2050 (the energy sector without transport and emissions from industrial processes), 
or it is necessary to reverse the downward trend of removals in the LULUCF specific sector in 
the long run. It is no less important to support new methods for greenhouse gas mitigation.  
Consistent horizontal implementation of measures that will be in harmony with this Strategy 
will be ensured by the Council of the Government of the Slovak Republic for the European 
Green Deal and Low-Carbon Transformation, which is approved together with this Strategy.

ANNEX  II  -  SPECIFIC  APPROACHES  AND  ANALYTICAL  MODELS 
APPLIED TO INDIVIDUAL SECTORS 
 
Different procedures and software modules for specific industries (sectors) of the national 
economy have been used in the projections of greenhouse gas emissions: 
•   Energy (including transport) and industry - CPS - Compact Primes Slovakia model 
•   Transport - CPS - Compact Primes Slovakia model and TREMOVE and COPERT IV 
models, and an expert approach 
•   Process emissions, Solvents – expert approach 
•   Agriculture - expert approach 
•   LULUCF - expert approach 
•   Waste - expert approach 
•   Macroeconomic analyses and indicators – Envisage Slovakia model 
 
 
Energy sector - modelling with models from the World Bank 
Modelling of emission projections has been done based on the results of the new CPS model. 
The CPS model is still not fully calibrated for CRF (Common Reporting Format) categorization 
of greenhouse gas emissions, therefore it was necessary to adjust the model results to the 
current greenhouse gas emission inventory.  
 
Transport sector –CPS and TREMOVE and COPERT models  
Transport emission projections were calculated using the CPS energy model and its scenarios 
as described above. At the same time, the COPERT 5 calculation model for the transport sector 
was used in the projections of emissions in the transport sector. The prediction of energy 
consumption  in  the  transport  sector  was  determined  as  a  percentage  of  fuels  in  total 
consumption in the energy sector. 
  
 
Road  transport  emissions  projections  were  calculated  based  on  the  following  data  and 
activities: 
  Aggregation of data transmitted from the COPERT 5 road transport model for the 
period 2000 – 2017, as the current COPERT version uses a total of 382 road vehicle 
categories. The aggregation took into account the mode of transport, the fuel used and 
the EURO emission standard. 
  Estimated  number  of  vehicles  for  each  year  (2018  –  2040)  based  on  new  vehicle 
registrations and the number of discarded vehicles. 
  Update of data on new registrations and discarded vehicles from IS EVO. 
  Allocation of new vehicle registrations to vehicle categories based on their energy 
consumption forecasts. 
 
 
88
    
  Classification  of  discarded  vehicles  into  categories  of  older  vehicles  so  that  their 
number  gradually  decreases  to  zero  due  to  ongoing  fleet  renewal  in  the  Slovak 
Republic. 
  Aggregation of annual mileage according to COPERT calculations for the period of 
2000 – 2017 into defined categories of vehicles and assumption of mileage development 
for the years 2018 – 2040.  
  Transfer of “implied” emission factors from COPERT and their appropriate breakdown 
for vehicle categorization in the projection model.  
  Calculation of future transport performance for 2018  – 2040 for the given vehicle 
categories.  
  Calculation of emission projections through multiplication of performance and emission 
factors. 
  Non-road  emission  projections  were  calculated  in  a  simpler  way  using 
AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modelling. 
 
Industry sector – expert approach  
The basic approach of preparing projections in the industrial sector for both scenarios lies in the 
growth of the added value in the industry categories. A maximum production capacity and 
stoichiometry  are  constraints  on  emission  projections  and  generally  follow  the  reference 
scenario.  The  software  itself  is  based  on  the  MS  Excel  platform  and  was  developed  for 
automatic generation of emission projections.  
Agriculture - expert approach The calculation of emission projections in the agriculture 
sector was based on mathematical formulae and definitions which are described in the IPCC 
Guidelines for agriculture categories. The emission factors and conversion factors are in line 
with the factors used in the emission inventory. The computational analytical tool is based on 
the MS Excel platform and the calculation includes various policies and measures (in numerical 
form) defined according to the WEM scenarios and the same was also used for the WAM 
scenario. 
 
The time series of input data for preparing emission projections were different in length (the 
longest for the period of years 1970 – 2016, the shortest for the period of years 2003 – 2016) 
and are mostly the following data: 
  The  most  important  parameter  is  the  number  of  livestock  used  to  estimate  CH  
4
emissions  from  enteric  fermentation  and  CH   and  N O  emissions  from  manure 
4 2
management. The results were used in the WEM scenario. 
  Animal  feed  information  is  important  in  estimating  CH   emissions  from  enteric 
4
fermentation used in the WEM scenario. 
The consumption of mineral nitrogen fertilizers, lime and urea was also taken into account in 
the WEM scenario. 
 
 
 
89
    
LULUCF – expert approach 
The calculation of emission projections in the LULUCF sector (Land use, land-use change, and 
forestry)  was  based  on  the  mathematical  formulae  and  definitions  described  in  the  IPCC 
Guidelines  for  categories  of  Land  use  and  land  use  change.  The  emission  factors  and 
conversion  factors  are  in  line  with  the  factors  used  in  the  emission  inventory.  The 
computational tool is based on the MS Excel platform and the calculation includes various 
policies and measures (in numerical form) defined according to the WEM and WAM scenarios. 
 
Waste sector - expert approach 
The calculation of emission projections in the waste sector was based on the mathematical 
formulae and definitions described in the IPCC Guidelines for waste categories. The emission 
factors and conversion factors are in line with the factors used in the emission inventory. The 
computational tool is based on the MS Excel platform and the calculation includes various 
policies and measures (in numerical form) under the WEM and WAM scenarios.  
Emissions  from  composting,  waste  incineration,  industrial  waste  disposal  and  the 
purification of industrial wastewater are estimated from an average of 10 years (2007 – 2017) 
dynamically, only in the case of biodegradable municipal waste composting, a constant value 
from 2017 is used throughout the projected period 2018 – 2040. 
Emissions from municipal waste disposal are affected by the amount of waste disposed of, 
which is regulated by the Waste Act and by the landfill gas combustion, which is regulated by 
the Air Pollution Control Act. The projections of emissions from municipal waste disposal are 
therefore divided into waste quantity modelling and landfill gas recovery modelling. 
Projections of total municipal waste produced are based on the projections of waste per capita 
and population growth. This procedure is in line with the Eunomia forecast52 prepared in 2016. 
This  waste  generation  forecast  is  used  for  all  scenarios  prepared.  The  amounts  of  sorted 
recyclable waste (paper, plastics, glass, food waste, biodegradable municipal waste) are used as 
variable variables in the preparation of individual scenarios. After estimating gross landfill 
emissions, net emissions are estimated by subtracting the removed CH .  
4
The main source of emissions from wastewater treatment are retention tanks (septic tanks). CH  
4
emission projections from wastewater are based on a changing number of people using public 
sewage systems and domestic wastewater treatment plants to estimate population reductions 
through  reservoirs.  Nitrogen  oxide  emissions  are  based  on  the  estimates  of  protein 
consumption, while the characterization of WWTP installations is assessed without changes. 
Biogas recovery from anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge is not a factor affecting emissions, 
as wastewater legislation requires that all anaerobic treatment plants have combustion systems 
or biogas combustion systems. In addition, heat produced from biogas is an important element 
of the energy balance of wastewater treatment plants under climatic conditions in Slovakia.

Only one scenario was prepared for the wastewater sector. For the period of years 2018 – 2040, 
there are no quantified targets available for defining alternative scenarios. The scenario with 
measures is based on the expectation that developments in waste management will continue as 
observed in the last decade. This development can be characterized by the gradual development 
of  sewage  systems  and  the  modernization  of  wastewater  treatment  plants  to  meet  EU 
requirements for water sector strategies.  
The model for modelling the amount of waste is derived from the statistical data on municipal 
waste presented under the Waste Management Programme 2010-2016, the source of which is 
the Statistical Survey of the SO SR on municipal waste53 and the analysis of waste composition 
published by Benešová.54 The total quantity of waste is estimated on the basis of demographic 
projections and the percentage of per capita waste. The waste produced is divided into mixed 
municipal waste, a group of separately collected components (sorted waste) which is subject to 
a waste composition analysis, and a group of other separately collected components not subject 
to a waste composition analysis. The same division applies to landfilled waste. The total 
landfilled waste is estimated as the difference between the total waste generated and the sum of 
recovered and incinerated waste. The model uses a number of sorted components as input 
variables. The amount of mixed / residual waste as well as changes in the waste composition, 
are estimated from these variables.  
 
 
A Detailed Description of the Scenarios Used in the Low-Carbon Study 
Below is a detailed description of the scenarios used to prepare the Low-Carbon Study from the 
WB.  
Reference scenario – herein referred to as the WEM scenario 
The WEM baseline or reference scenario is the starting point for understanding policy options. 
The reference scenario for Slovakia is a common projection including national commitments on 
climate action up to 2020. This scenario is similar to the reference scenario developed for the 
European Union in 2016. It includes policies adopted and implemented (2017) and additional 
policies required for meeting the commitments in the field of renewable sources and energy 
efficiency of the country in 2020. The trajectory of ETS allowance prices is based on ETS price 
projections for the 2016 EU reference scenario. 
2016 was designated as the reference year for the modelling of greenhouse gas emissions for all 
scenarios  for  which  verified  datasets  were  available  from  the  National  Greenhouse  Gas 
Inventories. The scenario is based on the logic of the EU RS 2016 scenario and includes 
policies and measures adopted and implemented at the EU and national levels by the end of

2016  which  contain  measures  needed  to  achieve  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency 
targets  in  2020.  Policies  included  in  the  EU  RS  2016  also  contain  amendments  to  three 
directives adopted in early 2015 (ILUC – the Renewable Energy Directive, FQD – the Fuel 
Quality Directive, and the EU ETS Market Stability Reserve decision). The scope of the EU RS 
2016 includes currently known policies and any additional measures necessary to achieve 
binding energy and climate targets by 2020. After 2020, other policy measures are excluded 
from  the  EU  RS  2016  except  the  EU  ETS  system.  The  pricing  trajectory  for  EU  ETS 
allowances draws on the outlooks of the prices of allowances for the EU RS 2016. 
Despite the absence of new policies after 2020, the reference scenario is not a frozen efficiency 
outlook. Energy efficiency improvements across all sectors continue in the future, albeit at a 
slower pace than would be the case with the enactment of new policies. The already established 
EU energy efficiency directives and regulations for the ecodesign of household appliances, 
engines  and  other  electrical  equipment  will  have  a growing  influence.  More  importantly, 
market forces are the drivers for efficiency progress. In industry, progress in energy efficiency 
is part of the pursuit of productivity growth, which is part of sustained growth in added value. 
In the buildings and transport sectors, energy efficiency improvements are achieved through the 
commercialization  of  equipment  and  vehicles  with  increasing  efficiency,  as  the  industry 
considers  operating  cost  reductions  to  be  a  marketing  factor  capable  of  increasing  sales. 
Therefore,  the  decoupling of energy  consumption  from economic  growth  continues  in  the 
future  as  a  result  of  technological  progress  (included  in  the  values  corresponding  to  the 
parameters  of  the  model  chosen  to  reflect  market  forces  set  below  levels  that  would  be 
adequate for policy-related technological progress). 
 
Decarbonisation scenarios 
In order to achieve the selected commitments by 2030, the reference scenario requires the 
identification and implementation of further policies and measures that would encourage a 
further reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the decarbonisation scenario used in 
the energy sector, industry and partly also in the transport was prepared and analysed for the 
SR. A 'Clean Energy for All Europeans' Package was considered in the proposal of the WAM 
scenario presented by the European Commission in November 2016. PRIMES model scenarios, 
entitled the EUCO scenario 2030 and 2050, supported the impact assessment of measures and 
targets proposed by the European Commission. Other scenarios of the PRIMES model, called 
the EUCO scenario 2030 and 2050, supported the assessment of measures and targets set out by 
the European Commission.   
The WAM scenario includes ways to achieve different  combinations of ambitious energy 
efficiency, renewable energy and emission reduction targets by 2030. The WAM scenario 
analyses  the  possibility  of  achieving  EU  targets  in  reducing  emissions  by  2050  (carbon 
neutrality).  The  scenario  includes  Slovakia’s  participation  in  the  EU  ETS  after  2020  and 
intermediate  targets  for  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency,  the  construction  of  new 
nuclear generation capacities, while maintaining its key role in the production mix. 
 
A Detailed Description of the Models Used 
 
 
 
92
    
Compact Primes Model (CPS) is a mathematical system implemented in the General Algebraic 
Modelling System, a model for high-level mathematical programming. The energy model is 
designed to support the development of an energy strategy including an assessment of political 
instruments, energy demand and energy supply planning, and an evaluation of climate change 
mitigation policies. The model includes the main metric of the energy sector at a more detailed 
level:  
  Energy demand by sector and fuel,  
  Modelling of energy efficiency options,  
  Technology capacity,  
  Mix  of  electricity  generation,  combined  heat  and  power  and  other  energy  supply 
technologies,  
  Fuel prices and system costs,  
  Sectoral investments and energy-related CO  emissions. 
2
An energy model for Slovakia captures the details of energy supply and demand that are critical 
to  designing  a  low-carbon  pathway.  A  country-level  energy  model,  named  the  Compact-
PRIMES  for  Slovakia  (CPS),  provides  a  bottom-up  technology-rich  analysis  of  the  key 
elements of the energy sector and has been designed to evaluate low-carbon options for the 
energy sector. The CPS model is a single-country partial equilibrium model of the energy 
sector which balances energy supply and demand. As a hybrid model with technology and 
engineering detail together with micro- and macroeconomic interactions and dynamics, the 
CPS’ sectoral decisions consider technology and costs. Electricity and heat supply and biomass 
supply are captured on the supply side while energy demand  modelling includes separate 
treatment of the industrial sector (and 10 subsectors), transport, and other demand. The design 
of the CPS model is  appropriate for the quantification of long-term energy planning and 
policies reducing energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
ENVISAGE  Slovakia  -(Slovak-CGE)-  is  a  macroeconomic  model  for  Slovakia  that 
complements the energy model using the detailed energy system results from the CPS model 
and assessing economywide impacts. It has all the features of a standard computable general 
equilibrium model but with additional detail in energy, electricity generation, and emissions so 
that it is useful for the assessment of climate policies. The macroeconomic model, named the 
ENVISAGE-Slovakia applied general equilibrium (Slovak-CGE) model, has been customized 
to  reflect  the  particular  features  of  the  Slovak  economy.  Importantly,  demand  for  energy 
commodities across households and firms is price sensitive, and various electricity generation 
options are captured. Emissions are explicitly modelled. A variety of mitigation policies can be 
analysed using the Slovak-CGE model. By comparison with the CPS energy model, the aim of 
the Slovak-CGE model is to simulate the broader economic effects of moving towards a low-
carbon economy. A detailed description of the models is provided in the Final Report on the 
Low-Carbon Growth Study for Slovakia project and is available on the website of the Ministry 
of the Environment of the Slovak Republic55.
