Introduction: Recent Situation on Climate Change, Economy and Society 
This “The Long-term Strategy under the Paris Agreement” (hereafter “Long-
term Strategy”) is  formulated by the Government of Japan as long-term low 
greenhouse  gas  emission  development  strategy  in  accordance  with  the 
provision1 of the Paris Agreement2.  
 
(1) Situation on Climate Change 
 
In recent years, extreme weather events which are thought to be partially 
attributed to climate change have been happening around the world3. Some 
studies have assessed that these events are the result of the expansion of human 
activities that are about to exceed the earth’s limitations. It has become an urgent 
task to take climate change measures throughout the world.  
In 2018, Japan suffered from the “Heavy Rain Event of July 2018” and the 
extremely hot conditions, which marked the highest temperatures in the national 
record, and 1,843 people, including a toll of 252 people 4, were affected by the 
torrential rains and typhoons. It is also reported that the economic damage from 
these  climate-change-related  disasters5  amounts  to  US$27.5  billion6 .  The 
responses to these disasters have placed a considerable economic burden to the 
central and local governments.  
 
 
                                                 
1 Article 4, Paragraph19 of the Paris Agreement: [a]ll Parties should strive to formulate 
and communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies, 
mindful  of  Article  2  taking  into  account  their  common  but  differentiated 
responsibilities  and  respective  capabilities,  in  the  light  of  different  national 
circumstances.  
2 Adopted in December 2015 (Signed in April 2016)  
3  According  to  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  Fifth 
Assessment Report, it is very likely that human influence has contributed to the 
observed global scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperatures 
extremes; it is likely that human influence has significantly raised the probability of 
occurrence of heat waves in some locations; there is high confidence that the intensity 
of extreme precipitation events will increase with warming at a rate well.

Jebi, and Typhoon Trami, according to Cabinet Office. In addition, material damages 
including houses ware generated.

of the ’Heavy Rain Event of July 2018’ and the Subsequent Heatwave in Japan from 
Mid-July Onward" 
6 Total amount of damages from Heavy Rain Event of July 2018, Typhoon Jebi and 
Typhoon Trami of that year. According to “Weather, Climate & Catastrophe Insight 
2018 Annual Report” (Aon plc, 2019).

(2) Trends in Climate Change in the International Community 
 
Considering  the  current  trend  in  international  conferences,  including  the 
Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (COP), there seem to be major changes in the world’s perception of 
climate change.  
Based on the scientific findings regarding climate change presented by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Paris Agreement was 
adopted at COP21 in December 2015, and came into force in November 2016. 
The  Paris  Agreement  stipulates  its  objective  to  hold  that  while  holding  the 
increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial 
levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels, and for this purpose, achieve a balance between anthropogenic 
emissions  by  sources  and  removals  by  sinks  of  greenhouse  gas  (GHG) 
(worldwide carbon neutrality) in the second half of this century. 
According to the “Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C7” adopted by the 
IPCC Session in October 2018, climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food 
security, water supply, human security and economic growth are projected to 
increase with global warming of 1.5°C, and increase further with 2°C. In limiting 
global warming to 1.5°C, anthropogenic CO emissions are expected to reach net 
2 
zero around 2050.8 Furthermore, it is suggested that emission pathways limiting 
global warming to 1.5°C would require rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, 
land, urban and infrastructure, and industrial systems. These transitions are said 
to be unprecedented in terms of scale, but not necessarily in terms of speed. 
The international community takes note with concern the findings of the IPCC 
Special  Report  on  Global  Warming  of  1.5°C  and  shares  the  necessity  of 
strengthening international responses to the threat of climate change. 
 
(3) Changes of Situation in Business including Finance 
 
With regard to climate change measures, significant changes that have not 
been experienced before are now taking place. Energy transition with low-cost 
renewable energy and the trend of companies and financial sectors that aim at 
                                                 
7 The Special Report on strengthening the global response to the threat of climate 
change, the impact of a 1.5°C temperature rise from its pre-industrial level and related 
worldwide  greenhouse  gas  emission  pathways  in  the  context  of  sustainable 
development and poverty reduction.  
8 In the emission pathways that contains global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited 
overshoot using multiple models, the net CO  emissions from anthropogenic sources 
2
worldwide are expected to reach net zero around 2050 (interquartile range between 
2045 to 2055). 
- 10 - 
  
zero  GHG  emissions  are  the  characteristic  changes.  There  is  a  growing 
possibility that the evaluation and assessment of a company will depend on 
whether or not it can promptly make transition to decarbonization. It could well be 
said  that  climate  change  measures  are  no  longer  a  cost,  but  a  source  of 
competitiveness among companies. 
The  International  Renewable  Energy Agency  (IRENA)  estimates  that  the 
additional investment needed for decarbonization of the energy industry, such as 
investment  for  energy-saving  measures,  renewable  energy,  carbon  dioxide 
capture and storage (CCS), building renovations and storage batteries, could 
reach  approximately  more  than  $29  trillion  by  2050,  which  will  drive  new 
economic growth, and increase GDP worldwide by 0.8% in 20509. In Japan, the 
amount of new investment in renewable energy has also increased significantly 
since 2012.  
In  the  financial  sector,  there  is  a  growing  movement  to  regard  corporate 
environmental  efforts  as  one  of  the  criteria  for  investment,  such  as  ESG 
investment that places emphasis on the Environment, Social, and Governance. 
Global  ESG  investment  in  2018  increased  by  more  than  2,000  trillion  yen 
compared to 2012, and ESG investment in Japan has grown more than four times 
from 2016 to 2018. In addition, there are also moves that can lead to restraining 
the use of fossil fuels that emit large amounts of CO2, including coal, through 
engagement  (holding  constructive  dialogues  with  invested  companies  to 
encourage actions), divestments (withdrawing investment on assets related to 
fossil fuels, including and especially coal-fired thermal power plants) and others. 
Divestment  alone  cannot  address  climate  change.  It  is  viewed  that  ESG 
investment  to  positively  evaluate  capital  investments  and  innovation  for 
decarbonization will attain further importance. 
Under such circumstances, in order to obtain significant finance required for 
capital  investment  and  technological  innovation  to  address  climate  change, 
competition could arise for access to ESG funds, which evaluates the efforts of 
climate change measures in a positive way. 
For ESG investment as well, it is important to attempt growth in a longer term 
and  improvement  of  corporate  value  in  a  sustainable  manner  through 
constructive dialogue and engagement between companies and investors based 
on the information disclosure. 
 
 
 
                                                 
9 “Perspectives for the energy transition”(2017,IEA and IRENA). Many models which 
are reported to the IPCC estimates negative effects on GDP, and the model taken in 
this report shows a different result.

(4) Adoption of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
 
The  “2030  Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development”  (2030  Agenda)  was 
adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015 in order to 
recognize various problems arising from human activities as urgent issues and 
let the international community work together to solve them. The 2030 Agenda 
was adopted as a universal goal for the entire international community, among 
which 17 goals and 169 targets were set as “Sustainable Development Goals, 
SDGs.”   In addition, the 2030 Agenda clearly states that “no one is left behind” 
on the earth to achieve the goal. Climate change could be a factor that can 
influence the achievement of other SDGs. In order to achieve the whole SDGs, it 
is necessary for Japan to promote climate change measures in line with elements 
of SDGs other than climate change.

Chapter 1: Basic Concepts 
 
1. Intent and Purpose of Formulating this Strategy 
 
In response to the urgent challenge of climate change, efforts to balance 
emissions and removal of the GHGs in the second half of this century have been 
accelerated  all  over  the  world.  Against  this  backdrop,  the  Paris  Agreement 
stipulates that all parties should strive to formulate and communicate long-term 
low  GHG  emission  development  strategies.  Determined  to  lead  global 
decarbonization, Japan will demonstrate its high aspiration and its stance to 
actively promote efforts for decarbonization both in and out of Japan. In particular,  
pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial 
levels is set as a global target in the Paris Agreement, and, especially since the 
IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C was published, it has attracted 
a  great  interest  and  discussions,  including  in  the  COP  process. This  is  an 
extremely difficult target that should be pursued worldwide; as a member of the 
international community, Japan will contribute to the world by formulating this 
long-term strategy and sharing the experiences out of its implementation, thereby 
contributing  to  achieving  the  aforementioned  target  set  forth  in  the  Paris 
Agreement. Furthermore, Japan will share these ideas and efforts with the world 
and promote them globally as the G20 presidency at the time of the formulation 
of this strategy in 2019. 
For these reasons, bearing in mind the changing situation described in the 
previous chapter, Japan formulates its long-term low GHG emission economic 
and social development strategy as a growth strategy. 
 
2. Japan’s Long-term Vision 
 
In its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution submitted in 2015, Japan 
set  forth  feasible  reduction  targets  for  the  fiscal  year  2030  by  bottom-up 
calculation with concrete policies, measures and individual technologies taking 
into adequate consideration, inter alia, technological and cost constraints. On the 
other  hand,  for  a  long-term  climate  change  policy,  the  Government  should 
present a clear vision as an “ideal future model” and show a policy direction 
towards it, thereby encouraging all stakeholders to make efforts for its realization 
through the pursuit of all possibilities.  
- 14 - 
  
For this reason, Japan proclaims a “decarbonized society10” as its ultimate goal 
and aims to accomplish it ambitiously as early as possible in the second half of 
this century. Toward that end, Japan has set a long-term temperature goal of 
reducing GHG emissions by 80% by 205011, and will boldly take measures 
towards its realization.  
Japan will achieve a virtuous cycle of environment and growth with disruptive 
innovation  that  is  heretofore  unconventional,  thereby  greatly  reducing  GHG 
emissions domestically. At the same time, Japan will contribute as much as 
possible to global emission reductions and achieve economic growth. This is in 
line with the aspiration of the Paris Agreement. Japan will manifest its contribution 
towards realization of the long-term goal in the Agreement: holding the increase 
in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above the pre-industrial 
levels, and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above the 
pre-industrial levels.  
This strategy sets forth a long-term vision as an “ideal future model” in each 
area.  These  visions  will  provide  directions  for  all  stakeholders  to  pursue 
possibilities towards the realization of these areas. At the same time, together 
with policy directions, they will improve the predictability of investment and serve 
as the basis for expanding the investment in Japan. At the same time, it identifies 
areas  which  need  disruptive  innovation  to  promote  corporate  R&D  and 
investment. Furthermore, by setting forth this vision, we will take the lead in future 
international discussions including the formulation of frameworks and standards 
in the area of climate change. 
 
3. Basic Principles in Policy towards the Long-term Vision 
 
(1) Achieving a Virtuous Cycle of Environment and Growth 
 
It is difficult to overcome climate change challenges through a mere extension 
of  conventional  efforts;  both  global  efforts  and  disruptive  innovation  will  be 
essential.  In  order  to  achieve  these,  it  will  become  important  to  make  the 
                                                 
10 Achieving a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by 
sinks of  greenhouse  gases in  the second  half of this century  (carbon  neutrality 
throughout the world). 
11 In the Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures (Cabinet decision on May 13, 2016), 
Japan has committed to lead the international community so that major emitters 
reduce their emissions in accordance to their abilities under the fair and effective 
international framework in which all major countries participate, based upon the 
Paris Agreement. It has also committed to working on 80% reduction of reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 as a long-term goal, while balancing global warming 
countermeasures and economic growth.  
- 15 - 
  
maximum use of the power of the business sector which has significant finance 
and technologies. 
As mentioned in the previous chapter, with climate change aggravating, the 
behavior of the business -- including the financial sector -- is beginning to change. 
In the longer term, it is certain that global demand for addressing climate change 
will grow; Japan will carry out policies to uphold and ensure the emergence of 
changes in the business sector, while involving citizens at all levels, realize a 
virtuous  cycle  of  environment  and  growth  through  business-led  disruptive 
innovation and contribute to the solution of the climate change problem. 
In order to achieve such business-led disruptive innovation, it is necessary to 
explore all possible options and review them in a flexible manner. It is also 
necessary to identify concrete targets in terms of costs and efficiencies in the key 
areas for decarbonization such as hydrogen, carbon dioxide capture and storage 
(CCS), carbon dioxide capture and utilization (CCU), renewable energy, storage 
batteries  and  nuclear  energy,  as  well  as  challenges  and  systems  including 
collaboration both in Japan and overseas. Policy and corporate resources will 
then need to be boldly utilized in close collaboration between public and private 
sectors. Likewise, as the climate change problem cannot be solved by  one 
country  alone,  it  is  necessary  to  gather  wisdoms  of  the  world,  to  aim  for 
“promotion of innovation,” and to advance technological development and its 
usage. 
Furthermore, in order to secure necessary finance for such innovation, and to 
promote investment for further innovation and measures, it is important to direct 
the flow of global finance towards companies that work on innovation through 
“visualization” of their efforts in climate change actions, and to build a system in 
which  financing  for  decarbonization  circulates  through  “promotion  of  green 
finance.” 
In addition, in order to achieve a virtuous cycle of environment and growth, it is 
necessary not only to reform the supply side, but also to create new demand 
consistent with the trend of decarbonization both inside and outside Japan. Given 
the circumstances of Japan with scarce fossil fuel resources of its own, energy 
efficiency improvement and renewable energy can also lead to growth in terms 
of  improved  trade  balance.  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  review  the  market, 
infrastructure and institution in the light of newly created innovation. Furthermore, 
it is also important to promote “business-led promotion of international application 
and international cooperation” with a view to offering products and technologies 
of excellent environmental performance globally. 
Through these efforts, a virtuous cycle in which companies challenging for 
disruptive innovation raise capital from the world and in turn enable further growth 
and  actions.  A  mechanism  whereby  the  business  leads  a  virtuous  cycle  of 
- 16 - 
  
environment and growth, making climate change more of a chance than a burden, 
leading global decarbonization and achieving growth, thus driving the transition 
to decarbonization is required. 
To serve for such a mechanism, this strategy comprises of three major pillars 
of measures: the "promotion of innovation" to realize a business-led virtuous 
cycle of environment and growth; the "promotion of green finance" to direct 
financial flow into innovation; and the “business-led international application and 
international cooperation” as a means for sharing the outcomes of innovation 
world-wide. 
In addition, in order to realize a virtuous cycle of environment and growth, 
Japan will prepare an environment that promotes and utilizes innovation for 
decarbonization at all levels, including companies, investors, financial institutions, 
consumers and local governments and brings about changes in lifestyle. 
 
(2) Swift implementation of actions 
 
Infrastructure such as urban structures and large-scale facilities will, once 
introduced, have a long-term impact on GHG emissions. Therefore, upon the 
development  infrastructure,  we  need  to  take  into  account  the  long-term 
environmental impact.  
Also from the viewpoint of business, the timeliness of innovation will be a key 
for capturing markets that emerge from the global climate change measures 
advancing in a longer term.  
In the light of climate change measures and relevant situations, Japan will 
henceforth make rapid efforts for decarbonization.  
 
(3) Contribution to the World 
 
Climate change is not an issue of one country; it is a global issue. Consistent 
with  the  principles  of  the  Paris Agreement,  reduction  in  GHG  emissions  is 
required all over the world. In particular, it is expected that a country like Japan, 
trusted worldwide for the quality of industrial products and the high standard of 
science and technology should contribute globally through the implementation of 
its long-term strategy. 
In order to realize a business-led virtuous cycle of environment and growth, as 
well as to drive global decarbonization, Japan will take the lead in providing a 
model and will embark on national efforts proactively. In order to contribute to 
reductions in GHG emissions worldwide, including in emerging and developing 
countries  where  economic  growth  and  population  explosions  are  expected, 
- 17 - 
  
Japan aims to expand business opportunities for global decarbonization and to 
become the hub of technology, human resource and investment.  
 
4. Toward a Bright Society with Hope for the Future 
 
A decarbonized society for which this strategy aims should also be a bright 
society with hope for the future. It is important to create an environment to work 
voluntarily and actively by sharing the model of such a society with as many 
stakeholders as possible. 
A bright society with hope for the future may differ depending on the generation, 
position  and  location.  For  that  reason,  it  is  important  for  each  individual  to 
envisage a model of society of its own, taking into account the following factors 
and to take actions.  
 
(a) Achievement of SDGs 
Japan will aim to maximize the co-benefits with other SDGs in its transition to 
a decarbonized society. 
 
(b) “Co-creation” as a basis for continued innovation 
Sharing the need for long-term social reform, repeated interactions between 
various types of knowledge are expected to create innovations in a “co-creative” 
manner. 
 
(c) Working with Society 5.0 
Society 5.0, a society that solves social issues and creates value through the 
digital revolution and the integration of imagination and creativity of various 
people, is expected to contribute to climate change measures with cross-cutting 
interactions including in energy, mobility and digitalization. 
 
(d) Circulating and Ecological Economy 
For Japan, where the population declines and the society ages with fewer 
children, it is important to set a growth strategy to strengthen the vitality of local 
communities.  Therefore,  Japan  will  aim  at  creation  of  the  “Circulating  and 
Ecological Economy”, where each regional community makes the maximum use 
of  regional  resources  in  a  sustainable  manner  to  become  self-reliant  and 
decentralized,  while  connecting  with  a  broader  network  of  communities  and 
striving  for  decabonization  and  SDGs  with  integrated  improvements  on  the 
environment, economy and society in the region. This concept of sustainable 
regional community will also be presented to the world with a view to providing a 
role model for the international community.   
- 18 - 
  
 
(e) Leading country in solving problems 
Japan aims to become an “leading country in solving problems" by sharing and 
applying the best practices from communities including cities and rural areas. 
 
Furthermore,  the  Government  will  support  each  stakeholder  including 
companies and local communities in sharing  awareness for a decarbonized 
society, forming a future vision of the society and taking proactive action. At the 
same time, the Government will facilitate the shift in minds of Japanese citizens 
at  all  levels  to  lead  them  to  take  action  with  capacity  building  and  public 
awareness  campaigns  to  disseminate  and  share  the  knowledge  of  climate 
change and specific actions to solve the problem.

Chapter  2.  Long-term  Vision  of  Each  Sector  and  Direction  of  Policies  and 
Measures 
 
Section 1. Policies and Measures for Emissions Reductions 
 
1. Energy 
 
(1) Current status 
 
a.  Progress in the reduction of energy-related CO2 emissions 
 
Energy-related  CO   accounts  for  approximately  90%  of  Japan's  GHG 
2
emissions. Actions of Japanese energy sector is crucial to significantly reduce 
GHG emissions. 
The current level of energy-related CO  emission reductions is 1.24 billion tons 
2
in FY 2013 and 1.11 billion tons in FY 2017 respectively, a decrease at the pace 
of approximately 30 million tons per annum.  
To reduce energy-related CO  emissions, there is a need for low-carbonization 
2
in energy supplies -- increase of the non-fossil power ratio in electricity supplies, 
improvement in the electrification rates, the shift to low carbon fuels in fossil fuel 
use -- and there is a need in energy efficiency (improved energy consumption 
efficiency). The state of progress for the particularly important non-fossil power 
ratios and energy efficiency is as follows: 
 
(a) Non-fossil electricity 
The non-fossil power ratio is expected to reach approximately 44% of the 
energy mix12 in FY 2030 by promoting the introduction of renewable energy 
and restarting nuclear power plants that are recognized to have met the world's 
strictest regulatory standards set by the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA). 
The non-fossil ratio in FY 2013 was approximately 12%, meaning an increase 
of about 2 percentage points a year is necessary to meet the level set out in 
this energy mix; in FY 2017, it was approximately 19%, which means the current 
pace of increase is about 2 percentage points a year. 
 
 
                                                 
12 "Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook" (Ministry of Economy, Trade and 
Industry, July 2015) provides an outlook for demand and supply in 2030, based on the 
principle of 3E + S and taking measures such as thorough energy efficiency, maximum 
introduction of renewable energy, higher efficiency of thermal power generation and 
the reduction of nuclear energy dependency as much as possible. 
- 21 - 
  
(b) Energy efficiency 
In the above-mentioned energy mix, the final energy consumption in FY 2030 
is forecast to be approx. 330 million kl: a reduction of about 50 million kl 
expected  with  rigorous  energy  efficiency  measures.  The  final  energy 
consumption in FY 2013 was 360 million kl. Therefore, to achieve the level 
indicated in this energy mix, an annual reduction of approximately 2.8 million kl 
is required. However, the reduction up to FY 2016 was 8.8 million kl, which 
means that the current annual reduction is approximately 2.2 million kl. 
 
Thus, although efforts have been steadily made, there is still a long way to go. 
It is important that relevant policies and measures are further developed and 
strengthened according to each energy type, thereby securing the achievement 
of the afore-mentioned energy mix. 
 
b.  Circumstances and future of energy in Japan 
 
It is important for Japan, envisaging a decarbonized society for its future, not 
only  to  have  ambitious  visions,  but  also  to  take  effective  measures  on  the 
circumstances it faces. Japanese energy sector is faced with a lack of domestic 
fossil resources such as oil, natural gas and coal, and is not equipped with 
international pipelines or interconnections. Dependence on the Middle East is 
extremely high among major economies. Both domestic household and industrial 
electricity rates have been higher than international standards due to the higher 
cost  resulting  from  the  increase  in  fossil  fuels  procurement,  following  the 
shutdown of the nuclear power plants due to the accident at Tokyo Electric Power 
Company's  Fukushima  Daiichi  Nuclear  Power  Plant.  There  has  thus  been 
concerns that Japan's international competitiveness in terms of energy costs will 
be deteriorated further. Although, due to a decline in the Japanese population, a 
quantitative growth in energy demand is not expected in the long-run, the quality 
demanded for electricity must be maintained. Japan is a mature economy with 
energy  infrastructure  (transmission  lines,  gas  conduits,  gas  stations  etc.)  
already in place nationwide. Energy efficiency is also extremely high, especially 
in  the  energy  intensive  industry. This  has  resulted  in  highly  reliable  energy 
technology, on which our supply chains are based. However, the planned power 
outages and fuel supply stagnation resulting from the March 2011 Great East 
Japan Earthquake and the large-scale power outages linked to the September 
2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake were a reminder of vulnerabilities in the 
existing energy infrastructures, posing risks to livelihoods and our economy. 
- 22 - 
  
Given the points outlined above, it is important that measures are taken to 
address them under the Strategic Energy Plan based on 3E + S13 as the basic 
principles on energy policy.14 Furthermore, it is important that efforts be made to 
achieve a decarbonized society, which is the ultimate goal. 
 
(2) Future vision 
 
Following is the directions for each energy type towards 2050: 
・ Renewable  energy  will  become  an  economically  self-sustained  and 
decarbonized main power source; 
・Japan is reducing its dependency on nuclear  energy as much as possible, 
while giving the top priority to nuclear safety and making efforts to expand 
renewable energy; 
・Efforts to reduce CO  emissions from thermal power generation, in line with the 
2
long-term goals set out in the Paris Agreement, will be made towards realizing 
a decarbonized society; 
・A “hydrogen society”, in which hydrogen is utilized in everyday life and in 
industrial activities, will be realized. 
・Promotion of energy efficiency, including efficient use of heat, and a distributed 
energy system that contributes to wider renewable energy usage and resilience 
of the energy system will be sought. 
 
The  long-term,  until  2050,  is  more  complex  and  uncertain.  Under  such 
circumstances,  it  is  important  that  all  possible  options  and  innovations  are 
explored, with ambitious and multi-track scenarios in all directions, including 
renewable energy, storage batteries, hydrogen, nuclear energy and the CCS and 
CCU. It is imperative that the realization of a decarbonized society as the ultimate 
goal be thus sought. 
 
(3) Direction of policies and measures for the future vision 
 
a.  Renewable energy 
 
The Government will continue to actively promote smooth and large scale 
                                                 
13 The principle of ensuring stable supply (“Energy Security”), and realizing low cost 
energy supply by enhancing its efficiency (“Economic Efficiency”) on the premise of 
“Safety,”  while  making  maximum  efforts  to  pursue  environment  suitability 
(“Environment”). 
14 The fifth Strategic Energy Plan is a Cabinet decision on July 3, 2018. 
- 23 - 
  
installation of renewable energy — solar energy, wind power, geo-thermal, hydro 
power15, biomass etc. — so that it will be sustainable as a stable main power 
source  in  the  long-term,  reducing  prices  to  the  level  comparable  to  the 
international standards and working towards self-reliance from the Feed-in Tariffs 
(FIT). In specific, the Government will work steadily on efforts to make renewable 
energy a stable power source in the long-term, including cost reduction, self-
reliance from FIT, and regional ecology, to overcome power grid constraints and 
to secure appropriate flexibility. Moreover, looking toward 2050, the Government 
will squarely address issues requiring a breakthrough by innovation. 
Aiming to reduce the cost, the Government will promote innovative research 
and  development.  At  the  same  time,  the  Government  will  work  towards 
appropriate operation of FIT, by utilizing auction system to reduce costs and 
lowering tariffs with the top runner approach to achieve the price target in specific. 
At the same time, the Government will consider how the system should be to 
facilitate  self-reliance  from  FIT.    Furthermore,  the  Government  will  promote 
renewable energy for self consumption and regional renewable energy supply, 
which also contribute to regional revitalization and disaster risk reduction. 
Furthermore, in order for renewable energy to become a stable main power 
source in the long-term, the Government will take measures to ensure that used 
solar panels, which will amass on a large scale in future, are reused, recycled 
and/or  properly  disposed  and  treated. With  regards  to  offshore  wind  power 
generation, which requires the occupation of sea area for a prolonged period, the 
Act of Promoting Utilization of Sea Areas in Development of Power Generation 
Facilities Using Maritime Renewable Energy Resources (Act No. 89 of 2018) will 
be appropriately implemented to realize a “long-term, stable and efficient” power 
generation business, in the light of the importance of introducing a reliable and 
cost-competitive power source to reduce the national burden. At the same time, 
comprehensive  measures  will  be  taken  to  deal  with  power  grid  constraints, 
measures for base ports, efforts to speed up related procedures and the provision 
of information. 
The Government will also make early implementation of the “Japanese version 
of Connect & Manage,” which utilizes the existing power grids to the maximum 
extent, with a view to overcoming power grid constraints. Moreover, in order to 
                                                 
15 In the Fifth Strategic Energy Plan, the hydropower is described as “play[ing] a central 
role of excellent energy source of stable supply except for drought-related problems, it 
will keep an important role in the energy supply structure” and “[r]egarding ordinary 
hydropower, in addition to developing large-scale hydropower, which has already been 
promoted to a substantial extent, GOJ promotes effective use of existing dams through 
cooperation among relevant parties. For example, it will install power generation 
facilities at existing dams which do not have such facilities and increase output by 
replacing existing power generation facilities of existing dams.” 
- 24 - 
  
switch to a next-generation transmission and distribution network taking into 
account the large-scale introduction of renewable energy and the expansion of 
distributed energy and other environmental changes, the Government will reduce 
the costs related to power grid upgrading.  The Government will also consider 
how the consigned transmission system should be amongst other issues, in order 
to develop an environment that secures predictability so that the necessary 
investments  are  made.  In  addition,  the  Government  will  also  enhance  the 
capacity and the use of interregional interconnections and other transmission 
lines. 
At the same time, in order to secure appropriate flexibility, the Government will 
take measures including utilization of pumped storage power generation, flexible 
utilization of thermal power generation, utilization of renewable energy itself as a 
flexibility source and revitalization of power interchange between areas utilizing 
interconnections  in  the  meantime.  Furthermore,  the  Government  will  take 
initiatives  for  future  decarbonization  of  flexibility  sources,  utilizing  the  next-
generation flexibility sources, such as Virtual Power Plant (VPP) that utilizes 
distributed energy resources installed on customers' side (stationary storage 
batteries,  cogeneration,  electric  vehicles  etc.),  Vehicle-to-Grid  (V2G)  which 
controls the reverse power flow from electrified vehicles, storage batteries for 
system stabilization, cogeneration, and, in the long-term, hydrogen and fuel cells. 
Moreover, towards 2050, the Government will squarely address issues requiring 
a breakthrough with innovation for renewable energy to be further introduced in 
the mass, and become an economically self-sustained and decarbonized main 
power  source.  Specifically,  the  Government  will  collaborate  with  local 
communities  to  immediately  begin  strengthening  the  human  resources, 
technologies  and  industrial  foundations  that  will  enable  the  resolution  of 
fundamental issues such as: drastic enhancement of power generation efficiency 
to  overcome  spatial  constraint;  development  of  high-performance,  low-cost 
storage batteries and hydrogen systems aimed at decarbonization of flexibility 
sources;  sophistication  of  power  electronics  technology  and  development  of 
digital  technology  to  conduct  supply/demand  adjustment  more  precisely; 
reinforcement of transmission networks taking into account the distribution of 
renewable energy, and; the development of distributed network systems. 
 
b.  Thermal power 
 
To realize a decarbonized society, the Government will work to reduce CO  
2
emissions from thermal power generation, in line with the long-term goals set out 
in the Paris Agreement. 
(a) CCS and CCU -- Carbon Recycling 
- 25 - 
  
As the efforts to overcome the environmental challenges of fossil fuels are 
important, there is a necessity to significantly reduce CO  emissions associated 
2
with  their  use.  It  is  also  important  that  challenges  be  made  towards 
technological development to achieve both improvement in energy access and 
implementation  of  climate  change  measures  with  disruptive  innovation  in 
developing countries. Japanese industries and research institutes have global 
competitiveness not only in the capture technology of CO  associated with 
2
emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, but also in elemental technology 
and material technology to efficiently use them in CO  utilization with solar 
2
energy and methanation; much expectation is on the initiatives in these areas. 
The Government is starting to regard CO  as a resource, and in collaboration 
2
with the industry, academia and government of other countries, competently 
facilitate innovations required for realizing Carbon Recycling – the CCS and 
CCU  that  reduces  CO   emissions  in  the  atmosphere  by  separating  and 
2
capturing  CO ,  and  through  mineralization,  artificial  photosynthesis  and 
2
methanation, reusing it as fuel and material. In addition, through activities such 
as those of the Carbon Recycling Council and others, the Government will be 
engaged  in  dissemination  to  the  society.  In  more  specific  terms,  the 
Government will accelerate the efforts of a wide range of stakeholders, aiming 
to establish its first commercial scale CCU technology by 2023 as a trigger for 
wider usage in view of full social adoption in 2030 and thereafter. 
Moreover, because it is also necessary to achieve the storage of CO , study 
2
on suitable sites for storage will be conducted.    At the same time, public-
private  cooperation  will  be  sought  in  this  area  to  achieve  optimal  CO  
2
transportation from the source of capture to the site of utilization/storage, and 
will be sought early adoption of the CCS and CCU in the society. In particular, 
introduction of the CCS by 2030 in the coal-fired power generation will be 
considered, with a view to commercialization. 
Furthermore, consideration will be given to the export of the CCS and CCU 
applied in the society through such initiatives. 
 
(b) Natural gas 
Natural gas is characterized by the lowest CO  emission factor among fossil 
2
fuels,  and  is  one  of  the  main  energy  source  pending  realization  of  a 
decarbonized society. The Government will steadily promote the shift to natural 
gas in the industry and other areas by diversifying its forms of usage, such as 
local  level  distribution  of  power  sources  through  cogeneration  systems, 
harmonious with renewable energy, and its utilization as a source of hydrogen 
source. In addition, the Government will promote advanced usage of natural 
gas such as combined cycle thermal power generation, taking advantage of 
renewal opportunities. 
- 26 - 
  
Currently,  Japan  is  procuring  natural  gas  at  a  high  price  compared  to 
international  standards,  and  it  is  essential  to  promote  cost  reduction  by 
diversifying the supply sources. In driving the shift to gas utilization16 , the 
Government will make strategic efforts to procure in a stable and competitive 
manner. More specifically, the Government will particularly proceed with: multi-
faceted resource diplomacy, including with the new LNG supplying countries, 
especially in the light of growing LNG exports from the United States, which 
has significantly impacted on the supply structure of fossil fuels following the 
shale revolution, and Russia, with abundant resource potential in the Arctic 
Circle; forming a highly flexible and transparent international LNG market by, 
for example, introducing more flexibility into commercial practices such as 
destination  restraints;  securing  more  active  participation  of  Japanese 
companies  in  the  global  LNG  business,  and;  development  of  domestic 
resources, especially in natural gas and methane hydrate reserves in the seas 
surrounding Japan. 
Over the longer term, in order to realize decarbonization of gas itself, the 
possibility of decarbonization with moderate social costs will be sought using 
existing LNG / city gas infrastructure and consumer-side equipment.  This will 
be  made  possible  with  development  and  usage  of  technologies  such  as: 
Carbon Recycling technology including methanation, which enable utilization 
and storage of surplus renewable energy; mixed combustion of hydrogen in 
natural gas-burning thermal power plants; hydrogen technology, and; biogas 
technology. 
In addition, in order to make efficient use of the sea side land, such as those 
left  vacated  with  the  consolidation  of  the  industry,  the  Government  will 
encourage the investment from the energy industries, such as the LNG and 
hydrogen industries that are affiliated with the seaside. 
 
(c) Coal 
The Government will work to reduce CO emissions from thermal power 
2 
generation to realize a decarbonized society and consistent with the long-term 
goals set out in the Paris Agreement. In this regard, the Government will work 
                                                 
16 Examples of gas utilizationare: high-efficiency LNG thermal power plants; 
environmentally friendly boilers; energy-efficient industrial furnaces; natural gas 
cogeneration that achieves substantial energy-saving by using combined heat and 
power; fuel cells; natural gas air conditioners that lessen the peak load on power 
grids, and; the transportation sector, including ships. The Government will make 
particular efforts for its utilization in the fields in which electrification and 
hydrogenation is difficult, such as industrial high-temperature heat and super-large-
scale transportation like ships. 
- 27 - 
  
to reduce reliance on coal-fired power generation as much as possible by 
fadeout17 inefficient coal-fired thermal power generation. 
 
c.  Hydrogen 
 
Hydrogen is a secondary energy that can be produced from a wide variety of 
energy sources, including renewable energy, and can be stored and transported. 
It can also be turned into a fully decarbonized source of energy by utilizing the 
CCS and CCU technology and renewable energy technology in the production 
stage. On top of that, the combination with fuel cell technology that extracts 
electricity and heat from hydrogen with high efficiency, enables the ultimate 
decarbonization  in  a  variety  of  fields,  not  only  in  the  electric  power  and 
transportation sectors, but also in industrial use and heat utilization. In this context, 
it is expected that hydrogen can be used as a new decarbonized alternative 
energy. 
In order to move ahead of the rest of the world in realizing a “hydrogen society” 
-- a society where hydrogen with these characteristics is used in everyday life as 
well as in industrial activities -- it is essential to bring down the procurement and 
supply  costs  of  hydrogen,  including  the  environmental  value,  to  levels  that 
compare  favorably  with  those  of  conventional  energy  sources. To  that  end, 
pursuant to the Basic Hydrogen Strategy18 (determined by the Ministerial Council 
on Renewable Energy, Hydrogen and Related Issues in December 2017), the 
Government will accelerate an expansion of demand for hydrogen in mobility, 
centering on fuel cell-powered vehicles in the immediate future. The Government 
aims to build an international hydrogen supply chain on a commercial scale and 
achieve a hydrogen cost of 30 yen per Nm3 by 2030, by building an international 
supply chain across the full range of “production, storage, transportation and 
utilization”  of  hydrogen  for  longer  term  reductions  of  hydrogen  costs  and 
proceeding with technology development for the introduction of hydrogen-based 
power generation that consumes a massive amount of hydrogen 
Furthermore, towards 2050, the Government aims to bring down the cost of 
hydrogen  to  20  yen  per  Nm3,  including  the  environmental  value:  the  level 
equivalent to that of existing energy sources in terms of cost competitiveness.  
To that end, the Government will collaborate with the industry and academia for 
research and development for innovative technologies that provide low-cost, 
                                                 
17 For example, measures under Act on Rationalizing Energy Use (Law number: Act No. 
49  of  1979),  such  as  regulatory  measures,  strict  operation  of  environmental 
assessments and shifting to cleaner gas usage will be taken. 
18 A policy for the entire government in taking measures to realize a hydrogen society, 
regarding hydrogen as a new option for carbon-free energy. 
- 28 - 
  
stable and mass production of hydrogen, and the development of technologies 
for supply infrastructure. The Government will also look into potential demand of 
hydrogen  as  a  decarbonized  energy  source  in  various  areas  including 
transportation, power generation and industries as well as ambitious deregulation 
under global collaboration. 
 
d.  Nuclear energy 
 
It is necessary for the Government to make comprehensive and responsible 
efforts, based on the Strategic  Energy Plan, concerning a variety of issues 
surrounding activities related to nuclear power including  resumption of nuclear 
power plant operations, measures to deal with spent nuclear fuels, nuclear fuel 
cycle, final disposal, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants with a view to 
gaining social trust from the public and to enabling stable operation of nuclear 
power plants while ensuring nuclear safety as a prerequisite since it is required 
to address long-term issues, such as the inexpensive and stable electric power 
supply and global warming.  
The Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) is entrusted with the professional 
judgement with authority  over the safety of  nuclear power plants under the 
premise that safety is prioritized over all other matters, and all efforts are made 
to alleviate public concerns. When the NRA confirms the conformity of a nuclear 
power plant with the strictest level of regulatory standards in the world, the 
Government respects the judgment and proceeds with the restart of nuclear 
power plants. The Government will continue to make best efforts to obtain the 
understanding and cooperation of relevant parties including the municipalities. 
Moreover, towards 2050, it is essential first and foremost to recover the public 
trust through efforts such as the reduction of the risk of accidents through further 
safety  enhancement  and  the  handling  of  backend  issues  including 
decommissioning reactors and processing and disposing of waste. To this end, 
the Government will immediately begin developing human resources, technology, 
and industrial infrastructure and be engaged in with the pursuit of reactors with 
superior  safety,  economic  efficiency,  and  flexibility,  as  well  as  in  technology 
development  and  international  collaboration  for  the  resolution  of  backend 
problems. 
 
e.  Energy efficiency/ distributed energy system 
 
The Government will support energy efficiency inprovementin the industrial, 
transport, business, and household  sectors, both in terms of regulation and 
assistance measures. 
- 29 - 
  
Additionally, the construction of a distributed energy system, or IoE (Internet of 
Energy), that combines distributed energy resources, such as renewable energy,   
storage  batteries  and  cogeneration  widely  in  use,  with  advanced  energy 
management technologies, such as power electronics technology, is important 
not only for the promotion of energy efficiency that includes the efficient use of 
heat and the further use of renewable energy, but also for its contribution to more 
efficient  energy  supply  structure  and  enhancement  of  resilience  on  energy 
system. Furthermore, it contributes to regional revitalization and to the formation 
of the Circulating and Ecological Economy. Also, it is expected that the cost 
required for high voltage and extra high voltage transmission infrastructures can 
be reduced by constructing a distributed energy system on the low voltage side. 
Therefore, the Government will proceed with necessary technical development 
and preparations for the construction of the efficient and stable distributed energy 
system in which power, heat and transport systems are integrated. 
 
(a) Energy efficiency 
The improvement in the efficiency of energy consumption has been stagnant 
in recent years, particularly in the industrial and business sectors. In order to 
further advance energy efficiency, the upgrading and replacement of equipment 
with  high  energy  efficiency  effects  need  to  be  enhanced.  Given  the 
considerable progress made at the individual company level, the Government 
will  encourage  collaboration  among  companies.  In  an  ongoing  effort,  the 
Government will continue to improve its supporting system including assistance 
for investment in energy efficient equipment and facilities and comprehensive 
assistance  starting  from  diagnosis  on  the  room  for  energy  efficiency 
improvement  to  actual  measures  and  feedbacks,  thereby  accelerating 
investment in energy efficiency from the business in line with regulations. 
Towards  2050,  the  Government  will  promote  innovative  improvement  of 
energy efficiency efforts in each sector and on the demand side. In the industrial 
sector, the Government will promote electrification and hydrogenation  with 
technology innovation, and will improve energy efficiency, including thorough 
utilization of unused heat, especially in difficult areas. Especially in the energy-
intensive manufacturing industry, the Government will endeavor to update the 
targets  and  benchmarks  to  reflect  such  development  as  the  international 
standards in the Industry Top Runner program (benchmark system), which sets 
the target of the energy consumption per unit in each industry, and align it 
effectively with other assistance measures. Furthermore, the Government will 
promote  net  Zero  Energy  House  (ZEH)  that  uses  advanced  energy 
management system based on personal consumption of energy, and also seek 
innovative energy usage to respond to the new business modalities and social 
- 30 - 
  
systems characterized by Artificial Intelligence (AT), Internet of Things (IoT), 
sharing economy and digitalization. 
 
(b) Distributed energy system 
With  the  aim  of  achieving  wider  use  of  distributed  energy  system,  the 
Government will make best use of the results of demonstration projects such 
as the supply and demand management systems that enable advanced energy 
management and standard interfaces. At the same time, the Government will 
share expertise such as how to coordinate relevant parties for the construction 
of the energy system. Furthermore, the Government will create an environment 
that  is  friendly  to  new  business  forms  using  the  VPP  —energy  resource 
aggregation business. 
Towards 2050, the Government will develop the downsizing and efficiency 
improvements  in  renewable  energy,  technological  innovations  in  storage 
batteries and fuel cell systems, power electronics technology and wireless 
power  supply  technology,  electric  transport  systems  and  progress  in 
digitalization technology and smart grid technology that make supply-demand 
control at the local level possible and digital technology that enables regional 
level control of supply and demand with such initiatives as a foundation. In 
doing  so,  the  Government  will  build  an  efficient,  stable  and  economical 
distributed energy system that integrates power, heat, gas (including hydrogen) 
and transport systems in a compact manner.

2. Industries19 
 
(1) Current status 
 
GHG emissions from the Japanese industries include energy-originated CO  
2
from power generation and heat generation, non-energy-originated CO  emitted 
2
from  industrial  processes  and  product  use,  methane,  nitrous  oxide,  and 
fluorinated gases (HFCs, PFCs, SF NF ) 
6,  3 .
Energy-related CO  accounts for the majority of industry emissions. The final 
2
figure for FY 2017 stands at 413 million tons, reduced by 11.2% compared to FY 
2013. The industries have taken voluntary efforts based on their Action Plan for 
the Commitment to a Low Carbon Society and energy consumption at large. 
At the same time, among the GHG emitted from industrial processes and 
product uses, the figure for the four fluorinated gases in FY 2017 amounts to 51 
million tons (CO  equivalent), an increase of 30.4% compared to FY 2013. This 
2
is attributed to an increase in emissions of HFCs resulting from the substitution 
of refrigerant from ozone-depleting substances. 
 
a.  Characteristics of the industrial sector 
 
Because Japanese industrial sector is broad-based and production volumes 
are large, it has two major characteristics from the perspective of GHG emissions. 
The first is the existence of a large amount of CO  emissions generated by the 
2
utilization of high temperature heat and chemical reactions such as reduction 
reactions. Numerous emission intensive industries, including the metal, chemical 
and cement industries, require extremely high-temperature heat, from several 
hundred to over a thousand degrees Celsius. In many cases, fossil fuels provide 
the source for such energy, and they are not easily replaceable by the likes of 
CO -free  electricity.  Furthermore,  for  chemical  reactions  such  as  reduction 
2
reactions, the generation of the GHG is, unavoidable as a matter of principle if 
existing industrial processes are followed. The second is the scale of emissions 
resulting  from  production  volumes.  For  present-day  living  standards  to  be 
maintained  and  improved,  a  certain  amount  of  production  is  considered 
necessary for many products. For example, over 100 million tons of steel is 
produced in Japan, while global production amounts to more than ten times of 
that. Therefore, attempts to replace steel with other existing products, may not be 
feasible due to supply-side restrictions. Even if it were possible, the problem of 
                                                 
19 “Industries”  here  refers  to  manufacturing  and  mining,  quarrying,  and  gravel 
extraction. 
- 32 - 
  
GHG  emissions  would  still  arise  from  the  production  process  of  alternative 
products. Furthermore, since it is possible to trade steel with foreign countries in 
terms of imports and exports, even if Japan reduced its manufacturing and the 
accompanying GHG emissions, it could merely increase overseas production and 
corresponding GHG emissions therein, effectively transferring them to another 
country. Such a case would not help solving the fundamental problem on a global 
scale, and the continuation of domestic production with further effective emission 
reductions could be a more valid option. 
 
b.  Voluntary initiatives by the industries  
 
Japanese industries have been taking initiatives since Keidanren (the Japan 
Business Federation) formulated the “Keidanren Voluntary Action Plan on the 
Environment” in June 1997, and each industry group has voluntarily set reduction 
targets prior to the development of national goals and taken measures. By March 
2019, 115 sectors formulated the "Low-Carbon Society Action Plan". They have 
taken  measures  in  their  own  sector,  and  not  only  contributed  to  domestic 
emission reductions, but also to reductions in other sectors and overseas with 
eyes on global warming measures worldwide. 
 
c.  Contributing to reductions through the global value chains (GVCs) 
 
For effective climate change measures, it is not only important to focus on the 
GHG emitted in the manufacturing and supplying phase of products and services, 
but also consider reduction contribution through global value chains (GVCs), 
which cover all phases from the initial stage of procurement of resources and 
materials to distribution, usage by consumers, disposal and recycling. 
It is important to contribute to GHG reductions throughout the worldwide supply 
chains  by  promoting  a  “visualization”  of  the  above-mentioned  initiatives  for 
emission reductions in GVCs and accelerating the development and usage of 
products and services with superior environmental performance. The Ministry of 
Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) considered basic approaches to visualizing 
the industries’ contributions to GHG reductions on their provision of goods and 
services,  and  formulated  the  “Guidelines  for  Quantifying  GHG  emission 
reductions of goods or services through Global Value Chain” in March 2018. 
Currently, the industries quantify their own contribution to reduction based on 
this Guidelines and send out information to stakeholders such as investors and 
consumers.  Furthermore,  the  industries  have  shared  the  above  concept  of 
contribution to reductions with the industries of the world, and through such 
- 33 - 
  
sharing and cultivating of this concept, are making efforts to contribute to the 
reduction in global emissions and further economic growth in Japan. 
 
d.  Company initiatives based on long-term perspectives 
 
Keidanren has called on its member companies and organizations to consider 
their own long-term vision and provide information thereof. By March 2019, over 
250 companies and organizations have either formulated or are considering the 
formulation of their "long-term vision." 
Furthermore, with the progress in ESG finance, efforts are ongoing to identify 
and reduce GHG emissions throughout the entire supply chains and to encourage 
the active use of renewable energy. 
For example, recently there has been an increasing number of companies that 
set SBTs (Science Based Targets) focusing on reduction targets across the entire 
supply chains in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and those participated 
in RE 100, aiming to  achieve business operations with the  100% usage of 
electricity of renewable energy origin. 
 
(2) Future vision 
 
For the industrial sector to aim for emission reductions in line with the long-
term goals of the Paris Agreement, it is necessary to take actions based on the 
perspectives in (1). 
To that end, challenges will be made to overcome the difficult problem that in 
many  industries,  there  are  no  existing  alternative  processes  that  can  be 
realistically  adopted  from  technological  and  economic  standpoints;  new 
alternative production processes will be established with disruptive innovations 
that  is  heretofore  unconventional  and  "decarbonized  manufacturing"  will  be 
achieved. The following two directions will be considered for this:  
Firstly, emissions that have been so far unavoidable will be reduced by utilizing 
CO -free hydrogen on a large scale to substitute for existing chemical reactions, 
2
including combustion (heat utilization); 
Secondly, on the premise that there will remain some cases where GHG 
emissions are unavoidable, the introduction of the CCS and CCU technologies 
for GHG to be separated, captured, and stored or utilized as a resource for 
production of valuables before their atmospheric diffusion. 
In addition, possible options include developing world-leading improvement of 
technology  in  energy  efficiency,  thereby  achieving  drastic  efficiency 
improvements in energy use by industrial sectors that are emitting CO , and the 
2
promotion of emission reductions throughout value chains. 
- 34 - 
  
 
(3) Direction of policies and measures for the future vision 
 
a.  Utilization of CO -free hydrogen 
2
 
Through the utilization of CO -free hydrogen, supplied inexpensively and stably 
2
in large quantities, CO  emitted in industrial manufacturing processes such as 
2
heat utilization and reduction reaction could be reduced. 
For example, in Japan, the mainstream method in steel production is via the 
blast furnace route, not only for economic efficiency but also from the viewpoint 
of quality and quantity, and this generally holds true throughout the world. With 
current blast furnace methods, coke is used to reduce iron ore (oxygen to be 
removed from iron oxide), but in theory, hydrogen can be used as a reducing 
agent instead of coke. Presently, research and development on the technology 
to reduce CO  emissions by partly replacing coke in blast furnace with hydrogen 
2
generated in steel works (COURSE 50: CO  Ultimate Reduction System for cool 
2
Earth 50) are being conducted, aiming to be commercialized by 2030. 
However, reductions in CO  emissions consistent with the long-term goals set 
2
out in the Paris Agreement are not achievable with this approach alone. Ultimately, 
challenges will be made to achieve "zero-carbon steel" with super-innovative 
technology, such as hydrogen reduction steel production that reduces iron ore 
only with hydrogen without using blast furnaces. Therefore, on the premises of 
CO -free hydrogen supplied at low-cost and stably, technologies will be pursued 
2
for further reduction of CO , such as the expansion of hydrogen reduction in the 
2
blast furnace methods with external hydrogen and ultimately hydrogen reduction 
steel production that does not use blast furnace methods, with the COURSE 50 
technology development led by steel industry as the first step. 
 
b.  Feedstock change with CCU, Carbon-Recycling and biomass  
 
By separating and capturing CO  emitted from manufacturing activities and 
2
recycling it as feedstock, it will be possible to achieve CO  emission reduction 
2
from industries, and secure a stable supply of natural resources. 
Although most primary chemical products are currently derived from fossil 
resources, it will be possible to reduce dependence on fossil resources and make 
CO  valuable through utilization of carbon contained in various other substances, 
2
etc. It is especially important to achieve carbon cycles in industries by utilizing 
CO  such as that emitted in the manufacturing process of chemical products and 
2
the biomass absorbing CO . 
2
- 35 - 
  
Moreover, it is also important to more efficiently separate and capture CO  by 
2
taking advantage of the particular characteristics of each industry. In addition to 
this,  achieving  effective  and  efficient  CCU  technologies  that  suit  the 
characteristics of each industrial process is conceivable. 
Using wastes, such as plastic wastes, as a carbon source, and using biomass 
not only for primary chemical products but also for cellulose nanofiber and other 
highly functional materials are also important. In order to do this, it is necessary 
to achieve not only CO  capture technologies but also a society in which carbon 
2
sources, such as biomass and waste, can be stably and efficiently provided. 
More specifically, the Government will proceed with measures such as the 
following: 
 
(a) Mineralization 
The  Government  aims  to  mineralize  CO   by  reaction  with  magnesium, 
2
calcium and the like, and utilize it in future construction materials. Therefore, 
the Government will examine low-cost and CO -free extraction of magnesium 
2
and calcium as raw materials, and carry out research and development for 
efficient CO mineralization. 
2
 
(b) Application onto chemicals and fuels (artificial photosynthesis, etc.) 
The Government aims to use CO  that is emitted from chemical plants and 
2
waste incinerators as a raw material to produce methanol and methane with 
water and hydrogen, and then use those in chemical raw materials, city gas 
and so on. Demonstration projects and other initiatives will be considered to 
this end. 
In  addition,  research,  development  and  demonstration  on  artificial 
photosynthesis  to  manufacture  primary  chemicals  (ethylene,  propylene, 
methanol, etc.) with the hydrogen made with solar energy will be sought, with 
a target of 2030 for commercialization (i.e. manufacturing some part of primary 
chemicals by artificial photosynthesis). 
 
(c) Biomass utilization technology 
The Government aims to manufacture plastics and biofuels by using biomass 
resources such as microalgae and plants absorbing CO , as well as waste and 
2
sewage. To achieve this, the Government will implement, inter alia, projects to 
demonstrate breeding algae and establish optimal cultivation environment. 
In addition, the Government will develop technologies comprehensively to 
produce various products such as plastics and cellulose nanofiber products 
from  non-edible  biomass  and  aim  to  achieve  energy  efficiency  at  the 
manufacturing and utilization phase. 
- 36 - 
  
 
(d) Utilization of unused exhaust heat in steelworks   
The technology to separate and capture CO  generated in the process of 
2
steelmaking with unused exhaust heat from steelworks will be developed. In 
addition, it is aimed that CO will be given a positive value by utilizing the 
2 
captured CO  as a raw material to synthesize organic compounds. 
2
 
c.  Achieving drastic improvement of energy efficiency 
 
It is essential for Japan, which has already achieved high levels of energy 
efficiency, to develop innovative technologies to achieve significant improvement 
of energy efficiency that targets manufacturing processes in each sector with high 
levels of energy consumption in order to achieve drastic improvement of energy 
efficiency in the industries. The technology that can be applied to numerous 
manufacturing  processes  is  also  important  even  if  its  impact  on  energy 
consumption in each process is limited. The examples of such technologies are 
given in Chapter 3 Section 1. The Government aims to further improve its energy 
efficiency levels by driving the development, implementation and wider usage of 
these technologies. 
More specifically, the Government will proceed with measures such as the 
following: 
 
(a)  Technological  development  for  highly  efficient  steelmaking  processes 
utilizing innovative reducing agent to substitute coke (ferro-coke) 
The technology for highly efficient and low temperature reduction of iron ore 
in blast furnaces, using as a catalyst the metal iron contained in ferro-coke 
which is produced by the briquetting and sintering of low grade coal and low 
grade iron ore will be developed. In this way, ahead of the establishment of 
hydrogen-driven  reduction  technology,  which  faces  high  technological  and 
economic challenges to overcome, significant improvement of energy efficiency 
will be achieved in the blast furnace steelmaking processes, currently in wide 
use. 
 
(b)  Technological  development  of  innovative  chemical  manufacturing 
processes, etc. 
By replacing the batch method which needs separation and purification in 
each reaction step with the flow method for continuous precise synthesis in the 
process of manufacturing fine chemicals such as electronic chemicals, dyes, 
pigments  and  pharmaceutical  intermediates,  etc.,  energy  efficiency  at 
manufacturing and use phase will be achieved. To that effect, the Government 
- 37 - 
  
will continue to take measures including development of   reactants and new 
catalysts, highly efficient reactors and monitoring technologies, and continuous 
separation and purification technologies. 
The  Government  will  also  continue  to  study  innovative  manufacturing 
process  technologies,  such  as  membrane  and  separation  by 
membrane/absorption  that  will  enable  significant  improvement  of  energy 
efficiency in comparison to conventional separation by distillation. 
 
(c) Technological development of innovative cement production processes 
For cement production, the Government aims to develop and promote usage 
of technology to reduce the thermal energy intensity for clinker production. 
Additionally, by changing the clinker mineral composition used currently and 
increasing  the  amount  of  mixed  materials  used,  the  Government  aims  to 
develop and promote usage of technology that can reduce the energy intensity 
in cement production. 
 
d.  Complete Transition of fluorocarbons in the longer term 
 
The Government intends to proceed with measures based on international 
frameworks and domestic laws for the control of fluorocarbons emissions which 
is an important issue, not only for the protection of the ozone layer, but also for 
combating climate change. First, based on the international framework of the 
Montreal Protocol and its domestic legislation, the Act on the Protection of the 
Ozone Layer through the Control of Specified Substances and Other Measures 
(Act No. 53 of 1988), the Government will reduce production and consumption of 
hydrofluorocarbons(HFCs) by 85% compared to the reference value (calculated 
from the average in period 2011-2013) by 2036. To achieve this, the Government 
intends to develop a cutting-edge low-GWP and non-fluorocarbon refrigerant 
which does not deplete the ozone layer and causes a low greenhouse effect, as 
well as the equipment for its use, thereby leading the world in measures against 
the fluorocarbons through such technology. 
And further still, based on the Act on Rational Use and Proper Management of 
Fluorocarbons  (Act  No.  64  of  2001;  hereafter  "Fluorocarbons  Emission 
Restraining Law"), the Government will continue to curb fluorocarbons emissions 
in the environment. The Government will also consider significantly reducing 
leakage  of  fluorocarbon  refrigerants  during  equipment  usage  by  promoting 
integrated management of equipment and refrigerant information using the IoT, 
and  establish  the  world's  best  emissions  control  measures  by  raising  the 
refrigerant recovery rate upon equipment disposal. 
- 38 - 
  
Through  the  measures  outlined  above,  the  Government  will  steadily  and 
incrementally reduce fluorocarbons, including reversing the rapidly increasing 
tendency of HFC emissions to a decreasing tendency in the short term, and aims 
to eventually complete transition from fluorocarbons in the longer term. Until the 
complete transition, the Government will take measures to curb emissions. 
Regarding  the  amount  of  PFCs,  SF6  and  NF3  emissions,  the  industrial 
Voluntary Action Plan has already achieved extremely high levels of emissions 
control, and the Government intends to maintain that level. 
More specifically, the Government will proceed with measures such as the 
following: 
 
(a) Development and introduction of low-GWP and non-fluorocarbon refrigerant 
technology  
The Government will steadily promote the development of technology for the 
introduction of low-GWP and non-fluorocarbon refrigerants, and the equipment 
that uses them, in order to achieve significant reductions in production and 
consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (reduction of 85% compared to reference 
values by 2036). In addition, the Government will accelerate the conversion of 
products using fluorocarbons to low-GWP and non-fluorocarbon refrigerants 
with  implementation  of  regulation  on  designated  products  based  on  the 
Fluorocarbons Emission Restraining Law, aiming to create the world's first low-
GWP and non-fluorocarbons refrigerants market. 
 
(b) Leakage prevention of fluorocarbons in refrigeration and air conditioner 
usage 
The  Government  will  consider  combined  advanced  initiatives  such  as 
integrated management of equipment / refrigerants information using the IoT 
and measures against leaks during usage on regular inspection of equipment 
in order to make large reductions of fluorocarbon refrigerants leakage during 
equipment use. 
 
(c)  Recovery  and  proper  management  and  adequate  processing  of 
fluorocarbons from refrigeration and air conditioners 
The Government will establish a system in which related stakeholders, such 
as  equipment  users,  waste  and  recycling  entities,  fluorocarbons  recovery 
entities and dismantling entities mutually cooperate and verify information with 
each other, so that the recovery of fluorocarbons as the user disposes the 
equipment will be ensured, and thus the fluorocarbons refrigerants emissions 
upon equipment disposal will be significantly reduced. 
 
- 39 - 
  
e.  Driving decarbonization in corporate management 
 
To  achieve  “decarbonized  manufacturing,”  it  is  important  not  only  for 
technologies such as those mentioned above to be introduced, but also initiatives 
for decarbonization to be taken by the industries. The Government will continue 
to support voluntarily reduction targets and subsequent implementation by each 
industry.  Furthermore,  the  Government  and  industries  will  work  together  to 
identify  the  challenges  and  measures  to  quantify  contributions  to  reduction 
through the value chains, and facilitate the understanding of the international 
community with awareness campaigns on the concepts and specific cases.as 
well  as  to  share  with  the  international  community  this  approach  to  achieve 
reduction in the entire value chain as well as efforts at quantification, aiming for 
wider adoption. The Government will also promote the setting of ambitious goals 
consistent with the long-term goals  set out in the Paris Agreement and the 
formulation  of  business  strategies  that  incorporate  climate-related  risks  and 
opportunities, including in their supply chain among the business community, 
including small and medium-sized enterprises. The Government will thereby 
increase  the  number  of  companies  that  incorporate  decarbonization  into 
corporate management, and facilitate wide acceptance in the society.

3. Transport 
 
(1) Current status 
 
Energy-related CO  emissions from Japan's transport sector were 213 million 
2
tons in FY 2017, a reduction of 4.9% compared to FY 2013. 
The Government has promoted the usage of next-generation vehicles, road 
traffic flow measures, public transport usage, and efficiency in logistics. 
 
a.  Status of the transport sector 
 
Japanese domestic passenger transport volume decreased in 2011 primarily 
due to the Great East Japan Earthquake, but the falling trend ceased in FY 2012 
and remained at that level since. Domestic freight transportation fell until FY 2012, 
due to the Great East Japan Earthquake that occurred in 2011 and a shortage of 
truck  drivers  for  automobile  freight  transportation.  From  FY  2012  onward, 
automobile freight transportation levelled off, and freight transportation volume 
remained at that level. As the population declines with declining birthrate and 
aging population, public transport networks, especially in rural areas, shrank. A 
labor shortage in the logistics also affects the amount of activities. 
Although the volume of the aforementioned activities contribute to the decrease 
of CO  emissions, motorization, especially in rural areas, is a contributing factor 
2
to the increase of emissions. 
 
b.  Structural change in the automobiles industry 
 
The automobiles sector has seen a wave of major technological innovation 
called  “CASE”20 in  recent  years.  These  major  structural  changes  can  be 
welcomed as enabling more efficient, safer, and free movement, and opening up 
new potentials in the relationship between automobiles and society. 
 
c.  Dynamic contribution to climate change measures relaying to automobiles 
 
The global sales of automobiles are expected to continue to grow especially in 
emerging countries, so expectation and demand for improved environmental 
performance of automobiles are rising on a global scale. The key to dynamic 
contribution  to  climate  change  measures  from  the  automobiles  sector  is  to 
improve their environmental performance by electric. Batteries, including storage 
                                                 
20 Connectivity, Autonomous, Shared & Service, and Electric 
- 41 - 
  
batteries and fuel cells, which are the key to being electrified, have undergone 
rapid technological innovation in recent years, and their prices continue to come 
down. Although further technological innovation is required for electrified vehicles 
to  achieve  specifications  at  an  affordable  price  to  match  those  of  internal 
combustion engines, there are potential breakthroughs. Japan is one of the most 
advanced electrified vehicle countries in the world (approx. 30% of new car 
sales21). In particular, Japan is at the world's top level when it comes to academia, 
technology, industry and human resources for batteries and other electrification. 
Using its strength in diverse electrified-vehicle technology, it is possible for Japan 
to  continue  actively  leading  the  world  and  contribute  to  the  solution  of  the 
environmental problem, not only in Japan but globally, by making best use of its 
experience and technology gained thus far. 
 
d.  Trends of GHG reductions in international shipping and international aviation 
 
Measures to reduce GHG emissions in the international shipping are entrusted 
to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) because they are not suited to 
the framework of country-specific reduction measures under the Paris Agreement. 
It  was  agreed  at  the  IMO  in April  2018  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  by  half 
(compared to 2008) by 2050 and to ultimately aim for zero GHG emissions as 
early as possible within this century. 
Similarly, measures to reduce GHG emissions in the international aviation are 
entrusted to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) because they are 
not suited to the framework of country-specific reduction measures under the 
Paris Agreement. Though CO  emissions from international civil aviation are 
2
expected to increase significantly, ICAO has agreed to improve fuel efficiency by 
2% annually and no increase in total emissions from 2020. 
 
(2) Future vision 
 
It  is  important  to  evaluate  CO   emissions  from  automobiles  from  the 
2
perspective of "Well-to-Wheel," including the process of producing gasoline and 
electricity. The potential of the electrified vehicles cannot be fully realized without 
such zero emissions initiatives; the degree of dependence on fossil fuels at the 
power generation varies heavily depending on the circumstances of each country, 
though it continues to be high mainly in emerging countries. Zero emissions as 
promoted by “Well-to-Wheel” base is ultimately the path the world should take, 
                                                 
21 Hybrid vehicle: 33.2%, Plug-in hybrid vehicle: 0.5%, Electric vehicle: 0.5%, Fuel cell 
vehicle:0.01% (FY2018) 
- 42 - 
  
including Japan. As such, in a long-term goal by 2050, Japanese cars supplied 
worldwide will achieve the world's highest level of environmental performance; 
specifically, GHG emissions will be reduced by approximately 80% per vehicle 
compared to 2010. Furthermore, as the ultimate goal, with innovations in how 
vehicles are used (autonomous drive, connected, etc.) and in collaboration with 
the global efforts to achieve zero emissions from  energy supply, Japan will 
contribute to realize Well-to-Wheel Zero Emission. The Government also reduce 
further  GHG  with  a  virtuous  cycle  of  improved  traffic  flows  and  enhanced 
productivity of the traffic industry, including initiatives such as the wide usage of 
systems  that  support  eco-driving  using  connected  technology,  digital 
technologies and collaboration among business operators. 
With regard to coastal shipping, further decarbonizing will be aimed at, in the 
light of the globally agreed IMO reduction targets of halving the GHG emissions 
from international shipping by 2050 and zero GHG emissions as early as possible 
within  this  century,  as  Japan  is  a  major  shipping  and  shipbuilding  country. 
Regarding domestic aviation, significant CO  reductions will be achieved in the 
2
light of the agreed ICAO targets of improving fuel efficiency by 2% each year and 
not increasing total emissions from 2020, while maintaining and strengthening 
the aviation network. Further CO  reductions for railways will also be achieved. 
2
 
(3) Direction of policies and measures for the future vision 
 
a.  Basic stances on Well-to-Wheel Zero Emissions Challenge 
 
(a) International collaboration on global issues 
The Government will clarify the policy for improving corporate average fuel 
efficiency and a comprehensive CO  reductions on Well-to-Wheel base, while 
2
encouraging technology-neutral investment in corporate electrified vehicles 
and investment in fuel combustion efficiency. Additionally, the Government will 
promote harmonization in institutional environments of respective countries in 
the world. 
The  Government  will  promote  the  harmonization  of  infrastructure  and 
institutional  environments  of  respective  countries  through  cooperation  and 
coordination with other  governments, to create environments in  which the 
vehicles  equipped  with  the  latest  environmental  technology  will  be  used 
worldwide, based on the needs of each region. 
 
(b) Establishment of a social system 
The  Government  will  realize  a  social  system  in  which  environmental 
technologies such as electrification and LNG are introduced to the maximum 
- 43 - 
  
extent, depending on a variety of applications (short-distance delivery, route 
buses,  long-distance  buses,  long-distance  trucks)  of  commercial  vehicles 
(buses and trucks). Large-sized vehicles (trucks and buses) are mainly for 
commercial  use,  and  there  are  strong  demands  for  "usability  in  line  with 
previous models" and "securing economic competitiveness." However, given 
current battery prices and the volumetric energy density of the batteries, it is 
not possible to keep prices economical by simply replacing the power source 
of the existing vehicle with batteries, and a model which could be sustainably 
put to a wide use is hard to envisage at this stage. Through collaboration among 
the industry, academia and Government, the Government aims to develop 
electrified vehicle technology and improve the environmental performance of 
internal combustion engines, both indispensable for further reductions of CO  
2
emissions, by encouraging the development and usage of next-generation 
large vehicles. In addition, the Government will particularly encourage the use 
of large electrified vehicles, which are currently expensive and limited in choice, 
starting with the type of usage to meet the requirement of transport operators 
seeking economical and convenient options. 
Focusing on the social value of cars as part of the energy infrastructure, and 
in order to promote the use of the power storage and power supply functions of 
the electrified vehicle, the “Council for Electrified Vehicle Society” is established 
to facilitate collaboration among energy companies, user companies and local 
authorities  together  with  the  automobiles  manufacturers.  The  Council  will 
promote the use of Business Continuity Plan (BCP) for vehicles, Vehicle to 
Home,  and  residential  and  industrial  reuse  of  automobile  batteries.  While 
establishing a decarbonized regional transportation model that utilizes CASE, 
initiatives to build a coupling model with independent and distributed regional 
energy  systems  will  be  sought.  Furthermore,  technology  to  store  surplus 
electricity is important in expanding the future use of renewable energy. The 
potential for hydrogen to enable large-scale and long-term energy storage is 
significant.  Therefore,  together  with  the  wider  usage  of  hydrogen-fueled 
mobility such as fuel cell cars, buses and trucks, the Government will look into 
the possibilities to make use of excess renewable energy in the transportation 
sector. 
The Government will make efforts for Japanese automobile manufacturers to 
enjoy stable procurement in the long-term of key mineral resources such as 
cobalt, which are indispensable in the manufacturing of batteries and which are 
concentrated in limited areas such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
More  specifically,  in  view  of  the  needs  on  the  demand  side  and  market 
conditions in the longer term, the Government will be engaged in resource 
diplomacy,  including  finance  to  upstream  development,  together  with  the 
- 44 - 
  
private  sector  to  achieve  stable  procurement  of  resources  necessary  for 
batteries. 
 
(c) Promotion of open innovation 
Using open innovation that goes beyond the collaboration among the industry, 
academia  and  Government  and  beyond  the  confines  of  a  company,  the 
Government will strive to achieve early commercialization and improve the 
productivity of next-generation electrification-related technologies, which hold 
a key, such as storage batteries, fuel cells, power semiconductors, motors, 
inverters, material weight reduction, wireless power supply, and automobile 
solar  charging  systems.  Furthermore,  the  Government  will  also  promote 
maximum efficiency of internal combustion engines, the key to streamlining 
corporate average fuel efficiency, and the development and early utilization of 
biofuels and alternative fuels that can be commercialized and have the capacity 
for significant CO  reduction. 
2
The Government will create an open development platform that uses model 
bases and an advanced development platform that uses the AI, which enable 
the response to structural changes such as electrified and autonomous driving. 
The Government will also create an environment in which human resources 
and suppliers are trained  based on collaboration between companies and 
between the industry and academia. 
 
b.  Road and traffic systems 
 
The  Government  will  make  efforts,  while  recognizing  the  induced  and 
converted traffic arising from road development, to ensure the smart use of roads 
such as the improvement of ring roads and other arterial road networks, which 
also  help  reduce  CO   emissions,  and  pinpoint  measures  to  reduce  traffic 
2
bottlenecks based on scientific data such as the big-data gathered with ETC2.0 
and AI camera. The Government will also pursue the possibility of CO  emissions 
2
reduction through the promotion of area-wide measures including price based 
measures for adjusting traffic demand by utilizing the ICT and AI at tourist spots.  
The Government will work towards traffic system improvements to help reduce 
CO  emissions through the promotion of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), such 
2
as the centrally controlled signals. 
 
c.  Long distance transportation methods 
 
With regards to long-distance transportation methods such as railways, ships 
and aviation, the Government will facilitate the introduction of energy-efficient 
- 45 - 
  
vehicles through weight reduction and high insulation, the operational efficiency 
using  IoT technology  and  satellites  and  CO   emission  reductions  at  related 
2
facilities. The Government will also facilitate the conversion of power sources to 
those using decarbonization technologies, such as the introduction of hydrogen 
and e-fuel derived from renewable energy and biofuels. 
The  Government  aims  to  decarbonize  coastal  shipping  with  the  use  of 
alternative  fuels,  fuel  cell  ships  and vessels  with  innovative  energy  efficient 
technologies, as well as the efficient operation, departure and docking of vessels 
utilizing the IoT. As the regulation for the emissions from ship exhausts has been 
strengthened by the IMO, the Government will promote the use of LNG fueled 
vessels of a lower environmental impact by establishing LNG bunkering bases in 
Japanese ports and conducting technical assessment during actual operation. At 
the same time, the Government will proceed with the  optimal placement of 
delivery bases that can accommodate large-sized vessels carrying fuels that 
contribute  to  decarbonization.  Furthermore,  to  improve  the  efficiency  of 
transportation of energy and other material, the Government will take measures 
to increase the size of vessels and diversify suppliers, as well as to facilitate 
coordinated transportation by using the ICT. 
With regards to aviation, the Government will work to reduce CO2 emissions 
in all the related fields: aircrafts, operations, facilities and fuels; introduction of 
aircraft with significantly improved energy efficiency using new materials and 
technologies; advanced air traffic control systems including the use of satellites; 
promotion  of  Eco-Airport,  and;  introducing  energy  that  contributes  to 
decarbonization, such as sustainable aviation fuels. 
 
d.  Mobility revolution and compact planning 
 
The maintenance of local daily transportation becomes more challenging as 
the population declines and ages and the birthrate continues to decline. In order 
to secure and maintain daily transportation networks against this backdrop, the 
Government  will  promote  the  revitalization  of  private  bus  services  through 
restructuring of the bus routes of the operators in the private sector and the 
effective  introduction  of  community  buses  and  demand  responsive  public 
transport. The Government will also promote CO  emissions reductions in these 
2
new public transportation methods. 
Additionally, the Government will promote the use of micro mobility vehicles 
that enables energy efficient transportation according to various needs of all 
generations. 
The Government will also take measures to improve services and convenience 
with new mobility services and to achieve seamless public transportation with: 
- 46 - 
  
improving  public  transport  such  as  railways;  improving  connection  between 
transport modes through public-private partnership for development of transport 
hubs (modal connectiveness); utilizing existing public transport; computerization; 
improvements in transfer points, introducing park and ride, and; Mobility as a 
Service (MaaS). 
 
e.  Logistics revolution 
 
The Government will facilitate the modal shift from automobile transportation 
to coastal shipping or rail transportation to reduce CO  emission and measure 
2
labor shortage in the logistics. In order to shorten onshore truck transportation 
distances to ports, the Government will promote the development of international 
marine  container  terminals  and  international  logistics  terminals,  and  high 
standardization that incorporates the ICT and IoT technology. Additionally, the 
Government will develop AI terminals for practical use, and pursue the reduction 
of CO  emissions by dissolving the queues of trailers waiting outside terminal 
2
gates. 
The Government will aim to reduce CO  emissions in and streamline logistics 
2
by utilizing new technologies such as drones, together with platforms for sharing 
and setting information among operators. 
The  Government  will  also  take  initiatives  to  reduce  CO   emissions  by 
2
encouraging cooperation between shippers and logistics companies carrying out 
deliveries, to improve efficiencies in transportation and loading. The Government 
will also work to establish low CO  emission transportation and delivery systems, 
2
with the collaboration of operators  by combining freight and passengers on 
existing transportation capabilities, such as passenger railways, express buses 
and route busses as well as the use of the IoT. 
The Government will pursue the possibility of reducing CO  emissions on 
2
highways with the commercialization of truck convoys and using double-trailers. 
In conjunction with this, the Government will aim to improve the efficiency of truck 
transportation with operations management support using ETC 2.0, as well as 
reviewing  the  special  vehicle-priority  permission  system  that  enables  route 
changes according to traffic conditions. The Government will also seek efficiency 
through specific studies on expressway infrastructure that supports new logistics 
systems. In light of the progress in autonomous driving, the AI, and the IoT related 
technologies, the Government will strive to optimize shipping services from an 
environmental  perspective,  in  addition  to  promoting  efforts  to  reduce  CO  
2
emissions  through  vehicle  dynamics  management  in  vehicle  operation.  To 
accelerate the use of environmentally friendly (eco-drive) vehicles, such as trucks 
and buses, for business, the Government aims for wider use of support systems 
- 47 - 
  
that uses the ICT technology amongst transportation companies. Furthermore, 
the  Government  works  to  reduce  the  GHG  emissions  in  automobile  air 
conditioning and refrigerated containers such as those for fresh food. 
Through the aforementioned initiatives to reduce CO  emissions and improve 
2
efficiency in the logistics sectors, the Government will simultaneously achieve 
energy efficiency and a reform in the working habits.

4. Community and living22 
 
(1) Current status 
 
Energy-related CO  emissions in the residential sector were 186 million tons in 
2
FY 2017, a drop of 10.7% compared with FY 2013. Energy-related CO  emissions 
2
in the commercial and others sectors were 207 million tons in FY 2017, a drop of 
12.2% compared with FY 2013. Methane emissions were 30.1 million tons (CO  
2
equivalent) in FY 2017, a drop of 6.9% compared with FY 2013. Nitrous oxide 
emissions were 20.5 million tons (CO  equivalent) in FY 2017, a drop of 5.2% 
2
compared with FY 2013. The Government has thus far convened nationwide 
campaigns, encouraged the improvement of energy efficiency of housing and 
building and accelerated introduction of facilities and devices of high energy 
efficiency. 
Improvement of energy efficiency and renewable energy in a local community 
can contribute to the development in that local economy. When looking at the 
local balance of energy costs, approximately 80% of local authorities see funds 
of 5% or more of gross regional production flowing out of the community and the 
figure is more than 10% in 379 local authorities23. 
Japan now faces an inevitable decline in the population in the coming decades 
as the birthrate declines and population ages. In addition to this, the population, 
especially the youth, continues to move from rural areas to cities, and accelerates 
a  geographical  imbalance  in  the  population.  The  young  population  and  the 
working-age population are decreasing in regions, including rural areas. 
There are also challenges such as urban sprawl, increased vacant houses and 
abandoned  farmland,  maintenance  and  management  cost  of  social  capital, 
growing automobile dependence, and the impact on households from soaring 
energy prices. 
While  each  community  faces  numerous  challenges,  they  all  have  diverse 
resources. Local resources include the locality's energy, natural resources, urban 
infrastructure and industrial clusters. Furthermore, there are also numerous other 
resources, such as the culture, climate, organizations and communities, and 
biodiversity.  The  progress  of  the  digital  revolution  may  well  contribute  to 
overcoming geographical constraints and moving towards a decentralized society. 
                                                 
22 “Community and living” refers to the residential sector, commercial and others sectors, 
agriculture, forestry and fisheries, the construction industry and the related energy 
conversion sector and urban planning sector. It also deals with methane and nitrous 
oxide emissions, from agriculture and waste. 
23 Estimated figures as of 2010, Ministry of the Environment’s Regional Economic 
Circulation Analysis Database 2013 
- 49 - 
  
It can also contribute to regional revitalization by forging connections between 
localities and metropolitan hubs. 
For problem solutions and improved sustainability into the future, it is important 
that the services and technologies required by each locality are provided and 
widely shared through innovation, which in turn will lead to the development of 
the entire nation. 
Local communities endowed with diverse resources alongside economic and 
social challenges are actually suited to become a model of a decarbonized 
society: a bright society with a hope for the future. 
 
(2) Future vision 
 
In  the  course  of  bringing  about  a  shift  in  the  social  system  towards  a 
decarbonized society, a change in the minds based on natural and societal ideals 
that take inspiration from the historical, cultural, geographical and  economic 
characteristics of Japan, or, in other words, based on the concept of "sustainable 
coexistence," is important at the individual, residential and regional levels. 
Additionally, a growth strategy that enhances community power is important. 
As  the  population  decline  with  decreasing  birthrate  and  aging  society,  it  is 
important that the regional economic cycle is enhanced to lead to the regional 
revitalization so that those who wish may develop and sustain their communities. 
It is also necessary to look at the issue from the other end, to take measures to 
respond to the climate change in line with the will of the people to develop and 
sustain  their  communities  notwithstanding  the  constraints  of  depopulation, 
thereby achieving the change in the minds. In addition, it is important to uplift 
socio-economic  activities  by  creating  business  in  the  local  community. 
Furthermore, it is important for the cities and rural areas to form a broader network 
for symbiosis and exchanges, complementing and supporting each other with 
their resources, by not just in its own community. 
Therefore, the Government aims at creating the “Circulating and Ecological 
Economy,”  where  each  regional  community  utilizes  regional  resources  in  a 
sustainable manner, and formulates a self-reliant and decentralized society while 
building  broader  networks,  in  order  to  advance  local  decarbonization,  and 
achieve the SDGs with integrated improvements on the environment, economy 
and  society,  thereby  achieving  a  carbon  neutral,  resilient  and  comfortable 
community and living by 2050. 
Especially in rural areas, under local leadership, full advantage will be taken of 
abundant  and  diverse  resources:  renewable  energy  including  biomass, 
photovoltaic solar panels built above the farmland (Farming-photovoltaics), and 
hydrogen. Furthermore, by supplying those energy sources to outside the rural 
- 50 - 
  
areas will contribute to significant reduction of GHG emissions on a wider scale 
in Japan. 
It  is  envisaged  that  capable  communities  and  companies  achieve  carbon 
neutrality even before 2050. 
 
Examples of initiatives to achieve local decarbonization and SDGs include the 
following: 
・  Housing  with high insulation  performance to reduce CO   emissions  and 
2
contribute to comfortability and good health; 
・ Increase in walking and cycling to curb CO  generated from transportation, 
2
and contribute to good health and less congestion; 
・Introducing telework and flextime systems utilizing the ICT, to reduce CO  
2
emissions from commuting transportation, also providing an environment for a 
better balance of work and childcare / nursing care, and improve productivity; 
・The construction of distributed energy systems using renewable energy to 
contribute to securing a decent amount of power for that region in case of 
disruption  in  the  power  sources.  Regional  initiatives  to  this  end  to  also 
contribute to upholding and strengthening the local community; 
・New jobs to be created by projects related to renewable energy, together with 
such  projects  as  improvement  of  energy  efficiency  and  elderly  care  to 
contribute to the upholding and developing of the local vitality; 
・Including  “Farming-photovoltaics”,  installing  photovoltaic  equipment  above 
farmlands, such as those abandoned, in a manner that allows farming to go 
along, renewable energy to be expanded and businesses to be profitable and 
contribution to be made the sustainability of the local community; 
・ Agricultural regeneration, cultivating symbiotic fuel crops on abandoned farm 
land, to contribute to the preservation of the ecosystem unique to each region, 
and; 
・Establishment of a hydrogen supply chain incorporating regional renewable 
energy  and  unused  resources  to  contribute  not  only  to  climate  change 
measures, but also to the regional energy self-sufficiency rate and the creation 
of new regional industries. 
 
(3) Directions policies and measures for the future vision 
 
a.   The shift to carbon-neutral living 
 
(a) Initiatives for housing and buildings 
Initiatives for housing and buildings are necessary in order to shift to carbon 
neutral living. 
- 51 - 
  
The facilities and equipment that accelerate energy efficiency, together with 
existing  technologies,  commercialized  new  materials  (high  efficiency 
semiconductors, etc.), design and control technology will be used as widely as 
possible. New energy efficient products with the AI, IoT, big data technology 
and coordination between devices will also be promoted for wider usage. As 
the average lifespan of home appliances is approximately 10 years, the market 
for these goods need to be formed by 2040 at the latest, for use by 2050. In the 
meantime, to limit the increases in energy consumption by using the ICT, the 
communications  systems  which  contribute  to  the  decarbonization  will  be 
promoted. 
It  is  important  to  promote  the  integrated  use  of  demand  and  supply  in 
photovoltaics in housing and buildings. The Government aims to make the use 
of photovoltaics a common features in houses and buildings. As the operating 
time of solar power generation is limited, the Government aims to achieve the 
sector coupling of electricity, heat, and mobility in general, using electrified 
vehicles,  heat  pump-type  water  heaters  fuel  cells  and  cogeneration,  and 
according to local characteristics, as well as the Home and Building Energy 
Management Systems (HEMS, BEMS) and the ICT for the supply and demand 
adjustment of photovoltaics power generation. In addition, electrified vehicle 
charging stations will be set up  considering the synchronism between the 
operating time of the photovoltaics power generation and the parking time. With 
such  measures  in  housing  and  buildings,  a  balance  between  supply  and 
demand across the entire power system will be sought. 
The Government also facilitates the use of underground and biomass heat, 
not easily affected by outside temperatures, to houses and buildings according 
to local characteristics with proposed utilization models as well as improvement 
of heat energy efficiency such as heat pump. In addition to the decarbonization 
of power supply, electrification and hydrogenation are effective in improving 
energy use efficiency in living. 
The Government has already decided that approximately net zero or less 
average energy consumption for new houses and buildings (ZEH / ZEB) will be 
sought by FY 2030. Furthermore, for new housing, the Government will avail 
the housing that contribute to a negative net emission in its entire life-cycle, 
from material production and construction, to dismantling and reuse for wider 
usage.  For  existing  houses  and  buildings,  the  Government  will  facilitate 
renovations and efforts of the residence to contribute to energy  efficiency 
improvement  based  on  local  characteristics.  The  Government  will  further 
facilitate innovative technological development and wider usage of building 
materials  and  equipment  necessary  to  bring  the  stock  average  of  energy 
consumption in houses and offices to approximately net zero or less (ZEH and 
- 52 - 
  
ZEB equivalent) as early as possible in the second half of this century. To 
achieve these measures, the Government will facilitate the enhancement and 
diffusion  of  evaluation  and  labeling  systems  related  to  comprehensive 
environmental performance, including energy for rented houses and buildings; 
this will be pursued in full view of the underlying problem that the investor / 
owner  of  the  energy  efficient  equipments  is  not  the  beneficiary  /  tenant. 
Additionally,  by  supporting  the  training  on  energy-saving  construction 
techniques for carpenters in small and medium-sized construction company, 
the Government facilitates the development and strengthening of the energy 
efficient  housing  construction  system  for  small  and  medium-sized  local 
constructors. 
 
(b) Lifestyle shift 
The behaviors and choices of each individual are also important in making a 
shift to carbon-neutral living. By changing daily living, local residents can be 
involved in a social change, creating a great force for change. In making living 
as a consumer and/or a producer, it is important to be involved in decarbonizing 
the society through the choice of products and services as well as the lifestyle. 
There is a rapid increase in “servicizing,” such as leasing and renting of 
products and the ESCO (Energy Service Company), focusing on the function 
of a product and providing that function of the product as a service, rather than 
selling the ownership of the product, making use of the IoT and AI. The sharing 
economy (e.g. car sharing, cycle sharing, private lodging services and shared 
houses), which is one form of such a service is also rapidly increasing. The 
Government will pursue the possibilities of lifestyle shifts through “servicizing,” 
especially  by  “visualizing”  the  emission  reduction  effects  and  taking 
decarbonization initiative based on the findings therein. 
For a consumer, preference for local production for local consumption can 
lead to reducing CO  emissions from logistics and to the opportunities for local 
2
industries. Bearing this point and the circumstances in each locality in mind, the 
Government  will  pursue  the  possibility  of  decarbonization  through  local 
production for local consumption, in view of the entire life-cycle of products, 
starting with the securing of resources, and including production, distribution, 
using, reusing, recycling and disposal. 
For a producer, the introduction of the telework and flextime system by 
making use of the ICT can reduce CO  emissions from commuting traffic. 
2
Additionally, shared office space, together with reduced use of air conditioners 
and space, can further contribute to improvement of energy efficiency in the 
office. While reducing CO  emissions, the environment and productivity will be 
2
improved to make it easier for people to balance work with childcare / nursing 
- 53 - 
  
care.  The  Government  will  support  a  reform  in  the  working  habits  by 
“visualizing,” demonstrating the effects of reducing CO  emissions. Expanding 
2
the use of remote access services such as virtual reality may also contribute to 
reducing CO  emissions from commuting and business trips. The Government 
2
will pursue the possibilities of decarbonizing through such approaches. 
Through initiatives such as commuting traffic management by the operators 
and public awareness activities, the shift to public transportation of low CO  
2
emissions, such as railways and buses, and further use of bicycles will be 
promoted,  instead of  privately  owned passenger vehicles. Additionally, the 
Government aims to reduce CO  emissions in logistics and distribution by 
2
reducing redelivery with cooperation among shippers and logistics and deliver 
companies, diversification and improved convenience in delivery methods for 
courier services, and  improving the  environment for  active participation  of 
consumers. 
The Government will also shed light on corporate activities as a consumer, 
such  as  the  use  of  renewable  energy,  and  promote  the  introduction  of 
renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives. 
For  these  lifestyle  shifts,  The  Government  will  carry  out  a  nationwide 
campaign to encourage “COOL CHOICE”, such as the use of goods and 
services that contribute to decarbonization, while putting together the scientific 
knowledge (citizen science) through public involvement. The Government will 
also  promote  the  use  of  environmental  information  for  decarbonization  by 
companies and individuals, such as the diffusion of methods for understanding 
GHG emissions throughout the entire supply chain, which includes local small 
and medium-sized enterprises, for the environment-conscious products and 
business activities to be highly valued by society and the market. Furthermore, 
through behavioral science knowledge including nudge and its integration with 
advanced technologies such as the AI and IoT, the Government will encourage 
decarbonizing behavior that can be practiced voluntarily and in an enjoyable 
way. 
 
b.  Shaping carbon-neutral communities 
 
(a) Cross-sectoral initiatives to create local self-sustaining and decentralized 
societies 
It is important that farming, forestry and fishing communities as well as cities 
become a carbon-neutral region, by complementing and supporting each other; 
each community is encouraged to make use of its characteristics, create a self-
sustaining and decentralized society, while becoming part of a broader network. 
Additionally,  it  is  important  that  a  community  in  which  power  generation 
- 54 - 
  
becomes  a  local  industry  with  renewable  energy  is  developed,  and  the 
construction of distributed grids is formed to support new forms of demands 
such as smart mobility. 
The distributed energy system will not only contribute to energy efficiency 
improvement and wider use of renewable energy, but also to local revitalization 
and to the formation of the Circulating and Ecological Economy. On the other 
hand, as this is also a part of Japanese entire energy system, the Government 
will promote the following initiatives while considering the cost and stability of 
the system as a whole. 
For the introduction of renewable energy symbiotic to the locality and its 
ecosystem,  the  Government  will  prepare  a  ground  for  community-based 
initiative including the local authority, enterprise, and residents and consensus 
building with local communities. Through these initiatives, the Government will 
promote  the  use  of  abandoned  farmland,  on  which  further  farming  is 
challenging,  for  large-scale  photovoltaics  to  reflect  local  symbiosis.  The 
Government will work to achieve shorter timeframe and smoother introduction 
of wind power generation. The Government will take initiatives to reduce costs 
for geothermal power generation, small and medium-sized hydroelectric power 
generation, biomass and renewable heat from the Sun, the underground, snow, 
hot  spring,  sea,  river  and  sewage,  and  encourage  their  use,  including 
consideration on their various values. The Government will also facilitate the 
creation of a business environment in which future reinvestments can be made. 
Moreover, in order to enable the use of self-sustained power sources, such 
as local renewable energy, even in the event of disasters, the Government will 
work  on  building  models  for  regional  energy  supply  grids  that  use  digital 
technology, storage batteries, fuel cells, cogeneration, etc. 
When introducing renewable energy into local regions, securing the flexibility 
is challenging. To this end, the local community is encouraged to come together 
to make the demands of local residents function as flexibility sources. In this 
regard,  the  Government  aims  to  smoothly  expand  the  energy  resource 
aggregation business, in which the “aggregator,” the information management 
and operation entity using the demand response (DR) and virtual power plant 
(VPP), facilitates the customers in controling and creating their demands of 
energy  at  the  request  of  the  retail  electric  power  companies  and  power 
transmission and distribution companies, who will pay fees for the adjusted 
demands. The Government will also look into the potential flexibility of heat 
storage type air-conditioning equipment, heat pump water heaters in facilities 
with large demand for hot water supply, cogeneration, refrigerated storage, 
water supply and sewage systems and back-up generators in large buildings. 
In  addition,  the  Government  will  encourage  smooth  renewable  energy 
- 55 - 
  
installation  by  matching  the  supply  and  demand  of  renewable  energy  by 
tracking the power and environmental value with block chain technology. 
Recently, there are cases in which a facility with high demand for power 
consumption, such as a data center, relocates to the area with a large supply 
of renewable energy. The Government will also look into such possibilities of 
geographical shifts on the demand side. 
In  order  to  move  such  initiatives  forward,  the  Government  and  local 
authorities will cooperate towards establishing an exemplary energy system 
that serves for wider use of the distributed energy systems. The Government 
will improve the information and communications infrastructure and institution 
for "prosumers"—those who do not only consume but also produce energy 
such  as  personal  photovoltaics  and  local  production  of  energy  for  local 
consumption by a local energy supplier. The Government will also encourage 
the formation of business entities that promote regional self-sustaining diffusion 
of decarbonization, thereby accelerating the development of the Circulating and 
Ecological  Economy.  Furthermore,  the  Government  will  utilize  emissions 
information platforms and make efforts for “visualization” to facilitate the smooth 
implementation of community and enterprise initiatives. 
In addition, the Government will support local activities that aim to create and 
spread innovations for a decarbonized society by engaging in dialogues with 
various relevant parties, including a consultative meeting. Local authorities, 
taking their own initiatives and setting examples for the  local entities and 
population, will play a central role in establishing the Circulating and Ecological 
Economy by cooperating and working together with various stakeholders in and 
out of the locality. 
 
(b) Carbon-neutral development in urban areas 
As the population declines, birthrate decreases and the society ages, and the 
infrastructure ages in urban areas, it is increasingly important to review urban 
development, including infrastructures such as transportation, in order to cope 
with these challenges. It is important that these issues are dealt with a view to 
decarbonization. 
In terms of the urban energy system, a significant reduction in CO  emissions 
2
can be expected by achieving efficient use of energy through flexible exchange 
of  energy  such  as  electricity  and  heat  amongst  numerous  facilities  and 
buildings. Therefore, the Government will take such opportunities as urban 
development and facilitate the area-wide use of energy. If a heat source and 
heat demand are appropriately concentrated in a city of a compact size, the 
availability of unused renewable heat will be increased. The Government will 
promote the use of such heat, in accordance with the economies and the 
- 56 - 
  
characteristics of each district. The Government will also promote initiatives that 
utilize energy management technologies such as the demand response (DR). 
Additionally, The Government will facilitate measures to reduce urban CO  
2
emissions with the improvement of the environment by taking measures against 
the heat island. 
Together with the initiatives to make urban areas more compact and to 
promote the use of public transport, the development for attractive space and 
environment to enable safe and comfortable walking and cycling will increase 
the proportion of walking and cycling, and thus reduce travel associated CO  
2
emissions. The Government will take the initiatives for further use of bicycles, 
together  with  safety  measures  based  on  the  Act  on  Promotion  of  Use  of 
Bicycles (Act No.113 of 2016), thereby reducing CO  emissions; the initiatives 
2
include the development of bicycle lanes, promoting combined use of bicycle 
trains, cycle sharing, the development of bicycle parks according to local needs, 
and the increase in bicycle commuting. 
In existing infrastructure such as public facilities, including water supply and 
sewage systems and waste treatment facilities, transportation infrastructure 
and energy infrastructure, the Government will promote energy efficiency  and 
make  them  a  regional  energy  center,  together  with  wide-area  integration, 
improved durability and better development of disaster reduction functions, 
thus contributing to reducing CO  emissions. Construction machinery is one of 
2
the challenging areas to achieve zero emissions. The Government facilitates 
the  introduction  of  facilities  and  equipment  with  high  energy  saving 
performance in the construction sector. In addition, the Government will aim to 
increase construction efficiency by encouraging active introduction of facilities 
and  equipment  that  utilizes  the  ICT,  and  improving  productivity  relative to 
energy consumption. 
Alignment  with  the  land  use  policy,  urban  policy,  and  the  regional 
development  policy  are  indispensable  in  achieving  flexible  exchange  of 
electricity and heat amongst numerous facilities and buildings, more compact 
urban areas and the use of local biomass in sewage treatment plants. The 
Government will align these related policies and climate change measures. 
 
(c) Developing carbon-neutral rural areas  
Rural  areas  play  an  important  role  in  supplying  resources  to  sustain 
Japanese  society  and  economy,  including  food  and  healthy  natural 
environment. With this in mind, it is important for these regions to be revitalized 
and overcome challenges associated with declining populations and birthrate 
and aging, so that they can contribute to the decarbonization of the society 
through  local  production  for  local  consumption  of  renewable  energy  and 
- 57 - 
  
biomass  resources,  such  as  the  utilization  of  locally  distributed  wood  for 
housing, as well as supplying such resources outside these villages. 
The Government will promote the introduction of local energy companies and 
the development of the energy system suited to  local production for local 
consumption, in order to make the best use of the abundant renewable energy 
sources rural areas offer, which in turn will lead to the vitality and sustainable 
development of the areas.  This will include the introduction of  the Village 
Energy Management System (VEMS). In terms of “Farming-photovoltaics,” the 
Government will take initiatives while working towards making good use of 
farmlands by appropriately continuing farming on the one hand, and activating 
community by supporting the reusing of the abandoned farmlands as well as 
settlement and farming in disadvantageous area on the other. 
In the agriculture, forestry and fisheries industries, the Government aims to 
reduce GHG emissions by achieving “smart agriculture, forestry and fishing” 
that leads to better efficiency with the ICT. The Government will also promote 
the introduction of energy efficient facilities, converting fuels to woody biomass 
and  using  underground  heat  in  horticultural  heating  facilities,  the  using  of 
livestock manure for energy, using electrified agricultural and forestry machines 
and fishing boats, including those with hydrogen fuel cells. Through these 
initiatives, the Government aims to achieve zero CO  emissions in agriculture, 
2
forestry and fishing. 
In agriculture, the Government will reduce methane emissions through the 
improvement of rice varieties and their use, as well as improving materials and 
production technologies and using them. The Government will reduce nitrous 
oxide emissions by controling the amount of applied fertilizers including with a 
combination of drone and sensing technology and the AI, and the improvement 
of materials. In addition, the Government will utilize the ICT and AI to monitor 
GHG emissions, and facilitate the introduction of a production system that 
reduces emissions. In the livestock industry, the Government will limit methane 
emissions with the improvement of feed and its use and the control of livestock 
numbers  to  go  along  with  productivity  improvement  measures  with  the 
improved breed. Moreover, with the improvement of feed and its use, emissions 
of nitrous oxide from livestock manure will also be reduced. The Government 
will also reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions through the composting 
of livestock manure, and the improvement of purification treatment facilities. 
The use of sustainable biomass resources can play an important role in 
decarbonization, especially in the areas where decarbonization through the use 
of  CO -free  electricity  is  challenging.  The  Government  will  pursue  the 
2
establishment of a biomass resource supply chain. 
- 58 - 
  
In  carrying  out  these  measures,  the  Government  will  promote 
decarbonization in the entire supply chain through production, processing, 
distribution, consumption and disposal (recycling) of agricultural, forestry and 
fishery products and food, as well as the visualization of measures related to 
the reduction of GHG emissions, such as certification and labeling. Moreover, 
the Government will promote organic agriculture to improve the natural cyclical 
function of agriculture and reduce the load on the environment, while raising 
the awareness of the consumers on organic agricultural products.  
 
c.  Material circulation in regions 
 
In order to achieve significant reduction of GHG emissions in local regions, 
promoting energy efficiencyand renewable energy alone will not be sufficient, and 
require alignment with material circulation. For a sound material-cycle society, it 
becomes more important to achieve an optimal scale of recycling according to 
each region and type of resources. Ultimately, material flow needs to meet three 
preconditions: firstly, wood and other such renewable resources should be used 
at a pace that does not exceed that of the renewal of the nature; secondly, metal, 
fossil and other such non-renewable resources should be used at a pace that 
does exceed the pace of development of sustainable renewable resources to 
replace them to avoid depletion, and; thirdly, substances that may affect the 
natural circulation and the delicate balance of ecosystem in the nature should be 
emitted into the natural world at a pace that does not exceed the pace at which 
the  nature  renders  them  harmless24. Through  past  economic  and  industrial 
activities, the humanity has spent huge amounts of energy to produce metal, 
plastic and other products; these can be regarded as existing resources. As such, 
recycling in all fields will not only resolve the constraints of the limited resources, 
but also contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions. The establishment of a 
circular economy has become an important policy issue in the Western societies, 
and it is important for Japan to achieve a sound  material-cycle in both the 
technical and institutional terms. While building a sound material-cycle society, 
the Government will promote decarbonization with resource recycling measures. 
By optimizing production volumes and timing with the analysis of the weather 
and  consumption  using  the  AI,  and  by  optimizing  the  inspection,  repair, 
replacement and reusing of products using the IoT, goods and services can be 
provided to the person in need precisely when and as required, reducing the 
energy demand. The Government will pursue such possibilities, and make efforts 
                                                 
24 The 4th Fundamental Plan for Establishing a Sound Material-Cycle Society (Cabinet 
decision, June 2018) 
- 59 - 
  
for  the  best  use  of  the  “urban  mine25”  and  minimum  extraction  of  natural 
resources, contributing to decarbonization with such efforts. 
The  reduction  of  food  loss  and  waste  throughout  the  supply  chain,  can 
contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions in terms of less food distribution 
and  manufacturing,  as  well  as  from  less  transportation  and  processing  for 
disposal.  The  Government  will  facilitate  decarbonization  with  such  efforts. 
Additionally, the Government will promote the use of food waste as feed to 
facilitate food recycling. 
The Government will advance resource circulation of plastics by reducing, 
reusing, thorough recovery, recycling, energy recovery, proper treatment and the 
promotion of the use of recycled materials and renewable resources — paper,  
biomass-based plastics, cellulose materials , etc. 
While promoting initiatives related to the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle), for waste 
which still remains, the Government will make every effort to promote efficient 
recovery of its energy, such as the heat recovery by waste power generation and 
the recovery of methane from raw waste. Additionally, waste treatment facilities 
will also aim to serve as a self-sustained distributed regional energy center, 
including in the event of disasters. Furthermore, the Government will facilitate the 
introduction of the AI and IoT to reduce GHG emissions across the entire waste 
treatment system, from collection and transportation to final disposal. 
To promote the recycling of resources in a wider area to recycle the waste 
which cannot be treated locally, the Government will designate “recycling ports”, 
which  will  be  a  base  for  reverse  logistics  and  recycling,  and  provide  a 
comprehensive support for such facilities such as: maintenance of port facilities; 
improvement in the operations for handling recyclable resources, and; public-
private partnerships. The Government will also work towards the establishment 
of a reverse logistics network within and out of Japan, centered around such 
recycling ports.  
The Government will promote to introduce energy efficient and renewable 
energy technologies nationwide in sewerage facilities. In particular, small and 
medium-sized sewage treatment plants will accept locally generated biomass, 
enabling efficient energy recovery throughout the locality. With these efforts, the 
Government aims to halve the power consumption in sewage treatment plants 
within approximately 20 years. Advanced wastewater treatment is effective not 
only for improved local water quality and the recycling of water resources, but 
also for the reduction of nitrous oxide emissions. The Government will promote 
advanced treatment of local water according to the local environment. However, 
                                                 
25 Metaphor to refer to the mass of the waste products that contain useful metals as a 
mine.  
- 60 - 
  
advanced  water  treatment  increases  energy  consumption;  therefore,  energy 
efficiency measures are promoted together. 
 
d.  Decarbonization starting with capable communities and businesses 
 
As an island nation, Japan has accumulated technologies for the self-sufficient 
energy system on remote islands. In addition, Japan is developing smart cities 
that  adopt  the  energy  management  system  made  possible  by  the  digital 
revolution. Furthermore, in rural areas, energy innovation that makes the best 
use of abundant resources is achievable. 
In the business community, numerous companies have announced their aim to 
use  100%  renewable  energy  in  their  electricity  consumption  by  2050.  In 
conjunction with this, companies have increasingly set out individual long-term 
vision, some of which envisage carbon neutrality by 2050. 
Bearing in mind the contribution to the 1.5 °C target, the Government will 
support ambitious communities and companies to work towards carbon neutrality 
and achieve it even before 2050 where possible. The Government will eagerly 
disseminate such efforts and aim to broaden the participation. As corporate 
activities greatly contribute to local decarbonization, the Government will facilitate 
ambitious  goal  setting,  reduction  initiatives  and  awareness  campaign  by 
companies, including small and medium-sized local companies. These measures 
will also help Japanese companies competing globally amidst the strong current 
of decarbonization. 
 
e.  Reconstructing and building a decarbonized society in Fukushima 
 
The  accident  at  the  Tokyo  Electric  Power  Company's  Fukushima  Daiichi 
Nuclear Power Station in March 2011 caused considerable injury to the people 
of Fukushima Prefecture and many others. It is important that Fukushima, which 
sustained heavy damage of the nuclear disaster, takes a lead in showing the 
shape  of  a  future  energy  society  and  lead  global  decarbonization.  The 
Government will thus strongly steer Fukushima's recovery and revitalization. 
Fukushima  Prefecture  promotes  the  expansion  of  renewable  energy,  the 
accumulation of related industries and research and development in order to 
make Fukushima a "pioneer of the renewable energy," which will be a major 
driving force for its reconstruction. Fukushima Prefecture also set the target to 
generate renewable energy for more than 100% of primary energy demands in 
Fukushima Prefecture by around 2040. To accelerate such efforts and  give 
support the recovery of Fukushima from the energy sector, the Government, 
Prefecture  and  related  companies  work  together  to  move  forward  with  the 
- 61 - 
  
initiatives, including the Fukushima Renewable Energy Institute, AIST (FREA) 
established  in  2014.  The  Government  will  also  provide  human  resource 
development for local companies related to renewable energy. With the aim of 
creating  the  world's  innovation  hub  for  renewable  energy  in  Fukushima  the 
Government will disseminate creative renewable energy technologies and new 
social model across Japan and abroad, and accelerate further initiatives and 
accumulation of industry clusters in Fukushima.

Section 2. Measures for Carbon Sinks 
 
(1) Current status 
 
The amount of carbon removal through land use, land-use change, and forestry 
activities in FY 2017 under article 3.3 and 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol was 47.6 
million  tons26 for  forest  sink  measures,  and  8.1  million  tons27 for  cropland 
management, grazing land management, urban revegetation, etc. 
 
It is important to promote relevant policies for sustainable land management, 
considering the issues such as: declining population and birthrate and aging 
population;  emerging  impacts  from  climate  change;  energy  challenges; 
intensifying global competition; aging infrastructure, and; the increase of land that 
is difficult to maintain properly. 
In particular, forests, which account for approximately 70% of Japanese land, 
supply timber among other forest products, provide public benefits such as land 
conservation, and play an important role as carbon sinks. 
Moreover,  cropland  and  grassland  soils  are  internationally  recognized  as 
carbon sinks that contribute to the securing of the removal of GHGs, along with 
forests. 
 
(2) Future vision 
 
The  Future  vision  is  to  establish  a  decarbonized  society,  which  secures 
sufficient  carbon  sinks  in  place  to  achieve  the  balance  between  the  GHG 
emissions  by  anthropogenic  sources  and  removals  by  sinks. Therefore,  the 
Government will promote conservation of the natural environment and activities 
in sustainable agriculture, forestry and fisheries industries that create new values. 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
26 The  amount  of  forest  removal  is  estimated  based  on  the  Rules  for  the  second 
commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, by combining emissions and removals from 
afforestation, reforestation, deforestation and forest management in FY 2017 (values 
adjusted for baseline emissions derived from changes in carbon accumulation in 
harvested wood products) 
27 The difference between the amount of emissions and removals in FY 2017 (emission 
of 3 million tons) and the amount in FY 1990 (emission of 11 million tons) 
- 63 - 
  
(3) Direction of policies and measures for the future vision 
 
a.  Forests and urban revegetation 
 
The  Government  will  facilitate  appropriate  forest  management,  such  as 
thinning and reforestation among other forestry activities, to enhance the sinks of 
the forests. In doing so, the Government will promote the wider and enhanced 
use of improved varieties for expedited growth and fast-growing trees.  
The Government will also promote urban revegetation, the most familiar form 
of sink measures for the daily life of the public, and not only benefit from the 
carbon removal, but also raise the awareness on the effects of these carbon sink 
measures. 
 
b.  Cropland 
 
The  Government  will  promote  carbon  storage  in  cropland  soil  with  the 
application of organic matter such as compost and green manure on the soil. The 
Government will assess the impact on growth of crops of using charcoal (biochar) 
as a soil improvement material. 
 
c.  The natural environment 
 
The Government will enhance the functions of healthy ecosystems to remove 
CO  by carrying out the conservation and restoration of forests, grasslands, 
2
wetlands and such as peat swamps as well as ecosystems such as those in soil 
and coasts, which fixate much carbon. In addition, The Government will promote 
appropriate  wildlife  control,  such  as  prevention  of  damage  and  population 
management, in order to reduce the damage by wildlife causing significant impact 
on ecosystems such as forests. This management will continue to contribute to 
emissions  removal  by  a  healthy  ecosystems.  The  Government  further 
accelerates the reduction of stress on ecosystems other than climate change —
land use change, environmental pollution, overuse, invasion of alien species, 
etc.— together with the maintenance  of ecological network that is the way used 
by wildlife for their move and disperse, in order to enhance the adaptability of 
ecosystems on climate change.
 
Regarding  "blue  carbon",  the  carbon  fixated  in  coastal  areas  and  marine 
ecosystems, the Government will explore the possibilities of blue carbon as a 
CO  carbon sink, such as conservation and restoration of algae beds using useful 
2
aquatic plants found nationwide. In addition to this, the Government will facilitate 
the  creation  of  new  industries  from  marine  resources  with  new  materials 
- 64 - 
  
development  and  innovation,  such  as  functional  foods  and  biomass-based 
plastics that use aquatic organisms as raw materials. 
 
d.  Carbon  storage  and  substitution  of  fossil  fuels  using  biomass  products 
including wood 
 
While  working  on  the  development  of  necessary  technologies  and  their 
diffusion  to  promote  wood  use  in  low-rise  non-residential  and  middle-rise 
buildings, the Government will realize innovation to further expand wood use in 
high-rise buildings in urban area as well. In addition, the Government will promote 
the  expansion  of  the  application  of  materials  derived  from  woody  biomass, 
including in automobile parts.

Chapter 3: Cross-sectoral Measures to be Focused 
 
Section 1: Promotion of Innovation 
 
In order to tackle the global challenge of climate change and to achieve a 
decarbonized society, which is the ultimate vision of the future, the creation of 
disruptive  innovation  beyond  a  mere  extension  of  conventional  efforts  is 
important. 
In order to realize a decarbonized society, it is important to overcome the 
simplistic view of “innovation is technological,” and to promote “innovation for the 
practical application and wide use” for the technology to be adopted in the society, 
putting  together  the  cutting-edge  technology  with  the  use  of  the  existing 
technology of much excellence. From this viewpoint, performance and efficiency 
are important, but as the performance cannot be shown unless chosen by the 
user, innovation that derives from actual needs and the vision of the future society 
is also important. 
Today, we are seeing the waves of global change and innovation as a result of 
cross-sectoral  interactions  including  those  between  energy,  mobility,  and 
digitalization. This also means the promotion of wide-ranging innovation towards 
the realization of “Society 5.0,” while ensuring the security of the ICT, can lead to 
technological innovation necessary for significant reductions in GHG emissions. 
In the midst of the evolution in the AI, IoT and block chain technologies, the public 
and private sectors need to come together to make best efforts for cross-sectoral 
innovation.  In  a  society  with  rapid  changes  in  digitalization,  data  usage, 
decentralization and globalization, communities and open venues where diverse 
ideas can actively interact with each other have become more important for 
innovation. 
 
I. Technological Innovation 
 
1. Current Status 
 
(1) Trends in Japan 
 
In order to achieve the long-term goals set out in the Paris Agreement, the 
Prime  Minister’s  instruction  was  issued  at  the  Global  Warming  Prevention 
Headquarters (November 26, 2015) and COP21 (November 30, 2015), for the 
Government  to  formulate  a  National  Energy  and  Environment  Strategy  for 
Technological Innovation towards 2050. The National Energy and Environment 
Strategy  for  Technological  Innovation  towards  2050  was  subsequently 
- 67 - 
  
formulated and decided by the Council for Science, Technology and Innovation 
under the Cabinet Office on 19th April 2016. This Strategy, assuming that the 
entire energy system will be optimized and looking ahead to 2050, approached 
the issue from the viewpoints of: technologies that are innovative and not the 
extension of the existing efforts but discontinuous and impactful; technologies 
with the potential for widespread adoption and significant emission reductions; 
technologies that require medium-to-long-term investment and combined forces 
among  the  industry,  academia  and  government,  and;  technologies  in  which 
Japan can take the lead or provide excellence. The Strategy further identified the 
following  fields  as  promising:  energy  systems  integration  technologies;  core 
technologies for systems (next-generation power electronics, innovative sensors 
and multipurpose superconductivity); innovative production process; ultralight 
and super heat-resistant structural material; next-generation storage battery; the 
production,  storage  and  use  of  energy  carriers  such  as  hydrogen;  next-
generation photovoltaics; next-generation geothermal power generation, and; the 
capture and effective usage of CO . Out of 30 billion tons of CO  reductions that 
2 2
are necessary to meet the 2 °C target, several billion tons to 10 billion tons or 
more of reductions are expected through this strategy (N.B. Based on the figures 
estimated by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The application of innovative 
technologies is added to the application of technologies whose development and 
demonstration have already been advanced in the selected technological areas). 
In September 2017, a roadmap for the National Energy and Environment Strategy 
for Technological Innovation towards 2050 was formulated, requiring relevant 
ministries and agencies united in their cooperation. 
The Integrated Innovation Strategy approved by the Cabinet on 15th June 2018 
presents future directions towards the achievement of the 2°C target of the Paris 
Agreement: building a new framework for a world-leading energy management 
system; international application of energy creation and storage technologies; 
leading  the  world  in  realizing  a  hydrogen-based  society,  and;  research  and 
development assessment for achieving the target. 
The Fifth Strategic Energy Plan approved by the Cabinet on July 3rd 2018 
mentions the year 2050 in an unprecedented manner, and, based on the global 
momentum for decarbonization as shown in the entry into force of the Paris 
Agreement, rises to the challenges of energy transformation and decarbonization 
and presents the stance to pursue all possible options. 
The Government has since 1974 formulated several strategies and plans for 
technologies in the fields of energy and environment such as those mentioned 
above and including the Sunshine Project, the Moonlight Project, and the New 
Sunshine Project and invested significant amounts of budgets for research and 
development in these fields. There are successful cases of long-term investment 
- 68 - 
  
on research and development coming into fruition; for example, in photovoltaics, 
Japanese companies provided much of the global production of solar cells for a 
certain period of time, making significant contribution to the world’s effort in 
tackling global warming. At the same time, in order for a certain technology to be 
adopted in the society, scientific values such as high-efficiency is not sufficient; 
low cost is the essential condition. There still remains a significant gap between 
the cost of decarbonizing technology and the cost afforded by the market. In the 
light of this reality, a mechanism to further reduce costs, taking into consideration 
the  environmental  values,  and  facilitates  introduction  of  technologies  to  be 
applied into the society on a large scale needs to be established. 
In the field of technology development, disruptive innovative technologies of an 
unconventional nature that offer a sweeping solution to the challenges, including 
the cost, on the one hand, and technologies to be developed in a shorter time 
framework, albeit less groundbreaking and owing much to the existing research 
and development, going on for some time, to aim for adoption in the society with 
high  confidence  on  the  other  hand  will  be  both  required.  In  seeking  these 
technologies, it will not serve the purpose unless the selection of technology and 
subsequent provision of resources for its development are made based on the 
disclosure of relevant pre-conditions and an objective life-cycle assessments 
(LCA), including the introduction to the market, of the GHG reduction effect. 
Currently, LCAs are often not carried out on GHG emissions, and even when they 
are, they are often conducted separately from cost analyses, making comparative 
analyses difficult. Furthermore, innovation in terms of scientific values is not 
enough; constant scrutiny from the viewpoint of users and in terms of the vision 
of future society, so that the pursuit of unnecessary technological goals will be 
prevented and the feasibility of timely entry in to the market will be taken into 
account. A high level of aspiration to contribute to the society will also be required, 
rather than simply focusing on values such as impact factors. 
 
(2) Global Trends 
 
Climate change is a global challenge, and it requires the wisdom of the world 
to gather together to create innovation. Mission Innovation was launched in 2016, 
following the Paris Agreement, as an initiative to promote expanded public and 
private sector investment in research and development in the clean energy field. 
Japan has participated in the initiative since the first session. There are currently 
24 member countries including the G7 and the European Union. Participating 
countries are committed to seek to double their public investment in clean energy 
research and development. In addition, there are eight Innovation Challenges, in 
which interested members collaborate to promote research and development in 
- 69 - 
  
each area. 
Japan has also hosted since 2014 the Innovation for Cool Earth Forum (ICEF) 
as  an  intellectual  platform  for  global  leaders  in  the  industry,  academia  and 
government to discuss and promote cooperation for the importance of innovation 
in energy and environment field, towards the solution of climate change problems. 
ICEF held its fifth annual meeting in 2018 with the attendance of over 1,000 
people  from  approximately  70  countries  to  discuss  key  challenges  for  the 
promotion of innovation and future strategies as well as specific technological 
fields,  and  the  outcome  was  announced  as  a  statement  by  ICEF  steering 
committee. It is hoped that ICEF and its outcomes will lead to concrete activities 
of international collaboration in order to create innovation. 
 
2. Directions of Policy Measures 
 
(1) Basic Directions of Policy Measures 
 
Towards the realization of a decarbonized society, scientific values such as 
high efficiency do not suffice; achieving the cost to enable adoption in the society 
is required, and so is innovation in technologies to reduce their “cost”. For this 
reason, it is necessary to induce as many disruptive innovations as possible. The 
Government will set targets for the cost to enable the technology to be adopted 
in the society, provide maximum resources of the public and private sectors, seek 
and create potential technologies in Japan and abroad, work towards necessary 
infrastructure  development  and  strengthen  initiatives  aimed  at  the  actual 
business opportunities. 
Reducing GHG emissions has to deal with future uncertainties, and therefore 
is an extremely broad, complex and difficult problem. Changing the entire world 
with  just  one  type  of  innovative  technology  would  be  difficult,  and  private 
investment for technologies requiring lengthy research and development is also 
difficult. Where there are several technologies and methods proposed, each of 
them has its own strengths and constraints, which make the assessment vary 
depending on the preconditions, making it practically impossible to single out a 
technology or method. 
It  is  therefore  necessary  to  enhance  the  foundation  of  latest  scientific 
knowledge in and out of Japan, continuously review the technologies and the 
state of the development of technology, including government supports to be 
received. In particular, the knowledge and financial resources in the private sector 
will be used as much as possible for research and development to realize a 
decarbonized society in 2050 and beyond. At the stage of basic research and 
feasibility studies, efforts will be made with a wide range of expertise, with a 
- 70 - 
  
priority  given  to  the  promising  technology  for  further  development  aimed  at 
practical application. Furthermore, in order to encourage public and private sector 
investment and introduce decarbonizing technology in the society on a large-
scale, promoting research and development on promising technologies is not 
sufficient; it will be important to constantly review the practical use and potentials 
of technologies in the light of the needs of the society, “visualize” the needs of 
the  users  and  the  bottlenecks  to  be  resolved,  and  objectively  present  the 
feasibility and limitation of technologies currently under consideration. In the light 
of all these, the public and private sectors will scrutinize the technology worthy of 
continued investment. 
On selecting the prioritized technology, whether or not that technology can lead 
to significant reductions of GHG emission is an important viewpoint, together with 
the scale of impact concerning the scope of applicability, such as the cross-
sectoral potentials for wider industries, not limiting itself to a single process. 
Hydrogen, for example, can be used in so many ways, not only as an alternative 
to fuels for automobiles, which depend heavily on fossil fuels, but also for: a 
substitute power source for coal and LNG-fired thermal power generation; a 
reducing agent in steel manufacturing in place of coke, and; by reacting with CO , 
2
as an alternative to crude oil and naphtha used in the petrochemical industry and 
natural gas used in the city gas, the leading cause of global warming. Power 
electronics technologies reduce energy consumptions of the entire power grid by 
improving power conversion and control, and further contribute to improving 
distributed and digital control technologies, such as the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) 
that functions as a flexible power regulator and enhances the stability of the grid 
and demand response (DR) to cater for the fluctuation of power generation from 
renewable energies. Similarly, energy storage technologies such as storage 
batteries are also extremely important in accelerating the wider use of renewable 
energy,  the  large  scale  introduction  of  which  has  been  held  back  due  to 
fluctuation in output. Energy storage technologies can serve as the power source 
for electrified vehicles, and increase the capacity factor of water electrolysis 
devices for hydrogen production connected to fluctuating renewable energy, 
playing a  major role  in a shift from the fossil fuel-dependent society to the 
eletrified society. These technologies will also help achieve “Well-to-Wheel Zero 
Emissions” in the transportation sector. 
The key to large-scale reduction in GHG emissions is a widespread usage of 
such technologies throughout the society. The biggest problem, however, is the 
extremely wide gap between the cost that users can afford and that achievable 
with  existing  technologies.  Efforts  to  reduce  costs  through  technology 
development will need to continue, but if such development cannot keep pace 
and significant cost reduction is unlikely in a timely manner, some other way of 
- 71 - 
  
achieving large-scale reductions in GHG emissions may become necessary. 
Additionally,  it  is  important  to  continue  building  platforms  for  research  and 
development for technologies of excellence. Furthermore, long term research 
and  development  to  make  use  of  prominent  ideas  of  the  individual  will  be 
promoted. 
Once a technology has been established to a certain extent, the demonstration 
of the technology at an optimal location — the market or production base — 
becomes  necessary.  The  optimal  location  may  well  be  abroad  in  terms  of 
available resources. Technology demonstration will be carried out in the best 
location be it in or out of Japan and including with international collaboration. 
Proceeding with attempts for practical application of technologies in the society 
and industry in view of the cost, rather than simply waiting for the development 
and demonstration stages to conclude, is also important. In the case of hydrogen, 
for example, it may be worth considering to establish a market in the first place 
with the following measures: while the market is in infancy, targeting on high 
value-added products with comparatively low impacts on the manufacturing cost, 
albeit with low CO  reduction effect; secondly, making maximum use of the 
2
existing infrastructure — for example, adding a tolerable level of hydrogen and 
methanation gas as the energy carrier28, in the existing gas supply systems and 
adding biofuel into the fuels (fossil fuels) for power generation and automobiles; 
thirdly, preparing the markets using the means which can achieve low prices 
albeit with low CO  emissions reduction effect in terms of the LCA — for example, 
2
the use of hydrogen derived from fossil fuels, and; provide policy support for the 
introduction. 
Technologies might enable large-scale reductions in GHG emissions and the 
use of fossil fuels might decrease; however, in the process of establishing a 
decarbonized society, emissions of the GHG such as CO  will still be unavoidable. 
2
Therefore, the capture, storage and effective use — recycling — of CO  will be 
2
necessary. In addition to this CCS and CCU or recycling of CO , the humanity 
2
has spent considerable energy to produce metal, plastic and other products in 
the past economic and industrial activities, and these can be regarded as existing 
resources. Promoting the circulation of resources in all fields will be useful in 
overcoming the resource constraints and, further, contribute to the reduction in 
GHG  emissions.  The  establishment  of  a  circular  economy  has  become  an 
important policy issue in the Western societies, and it is important for Japan to 
achieve a sound material-cycle society in both the technical and institutional 
terms. 
                                                 
28 The method to efficiently store and transport hydrogen as liquid, while hydrogen, 
gaseous at normal state, is difficult to handle.

(2) Enhancement of Scientific Knowledge 
 
Various changes, including the world situation, technology trends and life-
styles can take place in the long-term, and prediction on the long-term future is 
difficult. In order to achieve large-scale reductions in GHG emissions in the face 
of uncertainties, it is necessary to constantly review technologies, in the light of 
the situations at the time and technological trends, under ambitious and multi-
track scenarios in all directions. When taking climate change measures from a 
long-term and global viewpoint, latest scientific knowledge in and out of Japan 
will need to be continuously gathered to serve as a basis for such reviews. 
Further survey and research, including observation, need to be conducted on 
such  issues  as  further  unravelling  of  the  climate  change  mechanism, 
improvement in the accuracy of the projection and assessment of the adverse 
effects and risks; and it is important to furnish the system for these. For further 
unravelling of the climate change mechanism and improvement in the accuracy 
of the projection, the modeling and simulation technologies will be sophisticated, 
including the use of supercomputers, thereby improving the time and spatial 
resolution  and  generating  data  for  climate  change  projection,  including  the 
likelihood  of  occurrence  and  degree  of  certainty.  Japanese  climate  change 
projection data based on the needs of each sector will be enhanced.  GHG 
observational data will be put to greater use in the assessments of adverse 
effects and risks of climate change, with the use of the Data Integration and 
Analysis  System  in  particular.  The  Government  will  strategically  support 
researches  to  unravel  the  mechanisms  of  climate  change  and  assess  the 
environmental,  economic  and  social  impacts  of  climate  change,  aiming  for 
international cooperation where appropriate. With regard to the observation and 
monitoring related to climate change, comprehensive observation and monitoring 
to keep track of the GHG, climate change, and their effects will be continued. The 
Government will continue to observe the GHG in particular on a global scale from 
the space with the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT). GOSAT-2, 
launched in October 2018, is able to identify CO  from anthropogenic sources, 
2
and the observational results will help refine climate change projections, improve 
the transparency of emissions reporting in accordance with the Paris Agreement 
by the state parties, and contribute to follow how far each country has reached 
its targets in the global stock-take. In addition, the Government will continue its 
observation on land and with vessels and aircraft, summarizing and analyzing the 
resulting data to fill out the knowledge, and disseminating the findings both 
domestically  and  internationally.  Japan  will  also  carry  out  international 
cooperation by making use of the above-mentioned strengths.  
- 73 - 
  
 
(3)  Cross-Sectoral  Initiatives  in  Technology  Development  --  Progressive 
Environment Innovation Strategy 
 
The Government will formulate a Progressive Environment Innovation Strategy 
and make efforts in the medium term to facilitate disruptive innovation at the level 
of cost which enables it to be adopted in the society. This Strategy will be 
formulated during 2019 and disseminated to the world, in order for technologies 
to make the business case and contribute to the global reduction in emissions 
with: setting clear targets such as the cost as a signal from the Government; 
maximum provision of the resources from both the public and private sectors; 
long-term commitment including the size of investment; seeking out and creating 
potential technologies in Japan and abroad; setting challenges based on the 
needs; flexible support system for bold challenges for innovative themes, to avoid 
excessive risk-aversion; strengthened support for making it to the business case, 
and;  setting  up  institutional  promotion  and  comprehensive  support  for  the 
business. The Government has so far held a committee to study the potentials 
and feasibility of energy and environmental technologies in order to assess the 
demand and potentials of technologies that the society in 2050 will need, and to 
identify and “visualize” the bottlenecks for the realization  of a decarbonized 
society. The findings of these committees will be utilized. 
 
a. Seeking out and creating potential technologies in Japan and abroad and 
setting challenges based on the needs 
 
The  Ministry  of  Economy,  Trade  and  Industry  (METI)  began  the 
Unprecedented Challenge 2050 from 2017 to search out and create potential 
innovative low carbon technologies  primarily in fields shown  in the National 
Energy and Environment Strategy for Technological Innovation towards 2050. 
The program is aimed for young researchers at universities and other institutions 
under 40 years of age, to become prospective leaders in the front lines of their 
fields at around 2050. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and 
Technology (MEXT) has also started JST-Mirai program, specifying technological 
issues by back-casting from the goal of a large-scale reduction of CO  in 2050 
2
and  facilitating  high-risk  but  high-impact  research  and  development  utilizing 
academic ideas. METI and MEXT have collaborated to connect the academia 
with the academic issues arising from corporate research as part of Commit 2050 
and to act as intermediaries on academic research topics close to usage in the 
society. 
In  addition  to  this,  research  and  development  also  need  to  place  more 
- 74 - 
  
emphasis on the perspectives of the users, such as the “cost,” for decarbonizing 
technologies  to  be  introduced  to  the  society.  For  national  research  and 
development projects, a mechanism to identify technological issues required by 
the  society  and  users  and  to  facilitate  competition  among  technologies  by 
adopting a multi-track research and development approach will be considered. 
For research and technology development, it is important to objectively assess 
the potential of a technology on costs and CO  emissions with the LCA. 
2
In order to create disruptive technology innovation, the Government will look 
towards the future society, set ambitious goals for difficult yet highly impactful 
societal  challenges,  and  promote  stimulating  research  and  development, 
soliciting  progressive  and  provocative  research  ideas  from  a  wide  range  of 
researchers both in and outside Japan.  
The  international  joint  development  of  leading-edge  technology  using  the 
strengths of Japan and the partner country towards the technology targets of the 
National Energy and Environment Strategy for Technological Innovation towards 
2050 has been conducted so far on innovative energy technologies with the G7 
and other countries. The Government will continue to promote the joint research 
and development. From the viewpoint of gathering the wisdom of the world, the 
Government  has  participated  in  Mission  Innovation  and  the  ICEF  activities. 
Furthermore, as a new initiative, the Government will also invite leading figures 
in  science  and  technology  from  major  countries  (G20)  to  the  international 
conference held in Japan, drawing together diverse types of knowledge to create 
disruptive  innovation  for  large-scale  reductions  of  CO .  Specifically,  an 
2
international conference (RD20: Research and Development 20 for clean energy 
technologies) will be held in Japan to gather leaders in research institutions in the 
clean energy technology field in major countries (G20) to join forces to create 
innovation while utilizing the results of ICEF. Together with Mission Innovation, 
the RD20 is expected to strengthen the alliance among research institutions, 
paving the way to enhanced international joint research and development and 
generate concrete innovations from the wisdom of the world. Japan will take the 
initiative in setting up such an opportunity. 
 
b.  Stronger initiatives leading to business 
 
Young researchers and start-up companies, who are the key to the introduction 
of technologies to the society, will be in the front lines of research and technology 
development  in  the  future,  as  the  climate  change  further  progresses,  and 
therefore are extremely important players in research and development. This 
means that policies need to focus not just on seeking out potential technologies 
but  also  on  identifying  key  human  resources.  The  Government  will  seek  to 
- 75 - 
  
“visualize” this search for potential technologies and key human resources with 
research and development in the energy and environmental fields, in order to 
make this a case for business. Superior technologies on energy and environment 
owned by the start-ups are a source of innovation and a mechanism to bring 
funds to such technologies will be sought. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the 
research  and  technology  development  as  well  as  capital  investment  by 
companies  in  the  energy  and  environmental  fields,  such  activities  will  be 
“visualized” to the market and incentives will be designed to expand private sector 
investment. As an example, The Government continues to provide knowledge-
based  support  (NEDO  Pitches,  etc.)  for  companies  selected  by  public 
organizations.  For  the  startups  engaged  in  innovation  in  the  energy  and 
environmental  fields  in  particular,  the  Government  will  provide  infrastructure 
allowing for the maximum use of private sector capabilities. The research and 
development as well as business development of the start-ups and small and 
medium-sized companies will be supported in such ways. 
The  Government  also  aims  at  international  contributions  with  the 
commercialization and diffusion of technology through support to demonstration 
for initial market creation, international application and standardization starting 
with the initial stages of national research and development projects. 
 
(4) “Visualization” of Issues in Individual Fields for Commercialization 
 
The Government has already indicated the direction of various policy measures 
for technological innovation in a number of fields. The following describes the 
bottlenecks in introduction of key innovative technologies much expected to 
contribute to large-scale CO  reductions to the society. It is to be noted that the 
2
list of technology shown in this section is the illustration of potentials necessary 
to  achieve  targets  in  the  light  of  current  knowledge  in  each  field.  Careful 
examination  by  the  public  and  private  sectors  are  required  when  making 
investments. 
 
a.  Energy efficiency technology and energy transformation 
 
Energy efficiency technology provide a cross-sectoral foundation required not 
only for the sectors using fossil fuels but also for the sectors that have been 
transformed  from  fossil  fuel  use.  A  great  deal  of  technology  development 
investment has already been made here, and the first thing necessary is a 
thorough effective use of the heat, the majority of which is generated by the 
combustion of fossil fuel as the final energy consumption. The electrification at 
the demand-side is also expected to go along with initiatives to decarbonize 
- 76 - 
  
power sources. 
 
(a) Efficient use of heat 
Various efforts have been made in the effective use of waste heat generated 
in  the  industrial  production  process  with  ingenious  ideas  developed  by 
Japanese  companies.  However,  low  temperature  waste  heat  under  200 
degrees disperses on a small scale, making it difficult to be collected and used 
effectively, despite the vast amounts available overall. High temperature waste 
heat over 500 degrees is used in some areas, but its gaseous nature requires 
durable materials, which results in high costs, restricting effective utilization in 
some  areas.  The  sites  where  waste  heat  is  generated  have  yet  to  fully 
recognize the potential of heat, such as the amount of waste heat created in 
each specific process, leading to mismatches between waste heat and heat 
utilization. The development of technologies to use heat at low cost and free of 
location or time constraints is a major challenge in terms of energy efficiency 
and full utilization of heat generated. In addition to recognizing the actual 
amount of heat, specific technology issues include: nonmetal  — plastic or 
ceramic  —  heat  exchangers;  heat-driven  heat  pumps;  heat  transport 
techniques such as slurry; heat rectification; techniques to store heat with safe 
substances  enabling  controlled  nucleation,  and;  heat-blocking  and  heat 
insulation techniques. Secondary use of heat energy, such as conversion to 
electricity, is also an important area. 
 
(b) Electrification 
Furthermore, combined with initiatives for decarbonization of power sources, 
there are potentials for reduction of fossil fuel consumption in the industrial 
process, such as heating and drying, in its final energy consumption, while 
there are fields and processes where application of electrification is difficult. 
Improving process controls can not only lower energy consumption but also 
provide  added  value  for  high-mix  and  low-volume  small-lot  multi-model 
production and autonomous production processes. Furthermore, the ability to 
flexibly use part of the power for the production processes consuming large 
amounts  of  energy  offers  the  potential  for  flexibility  to  contribute  to  grid 
stabilization. Some degree of progress has been made in the adoption of 
equipment with high energy efficiency, such as heat pumps and infrared drying 
devices for efficient heating, as well as the equipment of much added value, 
such  as  induction  heating  equipment  devices  in  metal  processing,  which 
significantly improve the work environment. Further application will require 
technogical and economic solutions such as reducing the cost of equipment 
that tends to be high because of tailor-made nature and adding higher value on 
- 77 - 
  
processes and products with electrification. 
 
(c) Power electronics 
The application of power electronics instruments from power supply to the 
customer  site  contributes  to  maximize  the  energy  saving  effects  of 
electrification. Power electronics is a cross-sectoral technology that can lead to 
mush more energy saving for electrical equipment. Silicon semiconductors 
currently have over 90% market share, but development of next-generation 
power semiconductor materials, such as fabrication of novel structure silicon 
devices,  silicon  carbide  and  gallium  nitride,  to  cater  for  automotive  and 
industrial  applications  requiring  higher  pressure  resistance  and 
telecommunications equipment requiring faster operations. However, as the 
cost for next-generation power semiconductor  materials  still remains high, 
development in large-diameter wafer manufacturing processes and efficient 
and high quality crystal production technology is in progress. Moreover, the 
total design of power electronics systems, not just materials and devices but 
also  versatile  power  modules  including  peripheral  equipment,  magnetic 
substances,  heat  design  and  noise  control,  is  important  for  improving  the 
energy saving performance of power electronics. Research and development 
need to focus on each application area to identify the desirable overall design, 
optimizing the cost, efficiency, reliability, size and other factors to facilitate 
introduction to the society. It is important that aspects where to reducible costs 
and  achievable  standardizations  are  achieved  with  existing  technologies. 
Development of technologies for saving energy can also be extended to areas 
where  electrification  has  not  been  applied  but  semiconductors  can  be 
applicable, such as mechanical circuit breaker. 
 
〇Target: Maximum implementation of energy saving technologies with 
promising cost-effectiveness 
〇Examples of technologies relating to energy saving / energy conversion 
• Designs for energy saving: Designing of products and services where 
CO  emissions are zero or minimal over the life-cycle

• Utilizing unutilized heat: High temperature heat pump; heat exchange 
technology; heat storage / transport technology; thermoelectric 
conversion technology; heat blocking and insulation technology 
• Energy conversion: Electrification technologies for heating and drying —
shift  from  the  use  of  fossil  fuels;  smart  cells  —  using  bio 
technology 
• Cross-sectoral: High efficiency motor; power electronics; next-generation 
lighting;  light,  strong,  and  heat-resistant  material;  high-
- 78 - 
  
performance insulation material 
•  Individual  fields:  Alternative  membrane  separation  technology  in  the 
distillation process / chemistry; motor; resource recycling — plastics, light 
metals, etc.; heat management — automobiles, etc. 
 
b.  CCS and CCU / Negative Emissions 
 
(a) CCS 
A report of the IEA looks to carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a drastic 
measures to capture and store large volumes of CO , to make up 14% of 
2
cumulative CO  reduction by 2060 (reaching an annual 4.9 billion tons/16% 
2
reduction of CO  in 2060)29. The CCS is also deemed necessary if fossil fuels, 
2
generating  CO   emissions  in  the  process,  are  used  to  produce  CO -free 
2 2
hydrogen.  In  these  and  other  ways,  much  is  expected  of  the  CCS,  and 
demonstration projects continue inside and outside Japan. The CCS involving 
enhanced oil recovery (EOR) has been in commercial use in the United States 
since  the  1970s,  with  economic  incentives  in  the  form  of  tax  credits  and 
subsidies.  The  CCS  not  involving  EOR  has  yet  to  produce  self-sustained 
economic profits, and those countries that have already introduced the CCS 
adopt incentives such as subsidies, taxation and other regulations. 
The cost of the CCS therefore needs to be reduced further. The proportion 
of the energy cost for CO  separation and capture is particularly large, as the 
2
CCS  requires  the  heat  input  to  capture  the  separated  CO .  More  CO  
2 2
separation and capture methods need to be explored for lower costs. This will 
involve careful examination of the scale and features of each CO  source — 
2
CO  concentration, pressure, temperature, other substances in exhaust gases 
2
— as well as addressing the requirement from the demand CO  use and 
2
storage, such as using the heat and pressure of exhaust gases. 
The social adoption of the CCS requires both the public and private sectors 
to address the issues such as: further surveys on suitable locations for CO  
2
storage; securing such  locations; transportation of CO   if the sources are 
2
distant from the storage locations, and; securing social acceptance for carbon 
storage. 
In view of the need to identify solid geological structure suited to CO  storage 
2
and the time and cost required for building the infrastructure to properly store 
CO , the location for the site will need to secure an area as large as possible 
2
to achieve economy of scale. Further, a business model will have to be a 
comprehensive one, including transportation from the sources of CO  to the 
2
                                                 
29 Energy Technology Perspectives 2017 (IEA, 6 June 2017)  
- 79 - 
  
site of storage. In Japan, large-scale CO  sources are primarily located on the 
2
Pacific coast. Taking into account the results of past surveys of suitable site for 
CO  storage, the locations of sources and suitable CO  storage sites are not 
2 2
necessarily close to the other. Therefore, an adequate business model to safely 
and economically transport CO  will need to be developed to enable the private 
2
operator  to  consider  investment.  For  CO   storage  below  the  seabed,  the 
2
monitoring period and  methods are stipulated in the Act on Prevention of 
Marine Pollution and Maritime Disaster (Law No. 136, 1970) amongst other 
issues.  Safer  and  more  suitable  monitoring  period  and  methods  will  be 
examined. Considering these points, a comprehensive system will need to be 
developed  to  cover  separation,  capture,  transport,  and  storage  in  both 
economical and safe manner, with a suitable division of roles between the 
public and private sectors. This will be accompanied by active awareness 
campaign to seek further understanding among relevant parties such as local 
authorities and social acceptance of the CCS at large. The Government will 
continue to seek international collaboration on research and development, 
demonstration, standardization and further rulemakings. 
 
(b) CCU / carbon recycling 
Based  on  the  Roadmap  for  Carbon  Recycling  Technologies 30 ,  the 
Government  will  engage  in  the  development  of  technology  to  reduce  CO  
2
capture costs and to convert the captured CO  into valuable carbon-derived 
2
materials and resources, such as chemicals, fuels and minerals, with the aim of 
creating a new social system backed by innovation. In order to pursue innovation 
with a fully global outlook, the Government will hold an international conference 
on  carbon  recycling,  drawing  participants  from  the  industry,  academia  and 
government, and seeking collaboration in this context. 
Carbon  capture  and  utilization  (CCU)  offer  can  potentially  contribute  to 
decarbonization  that meets economic sense in terms of alternatives to fossil-
derived chemicals and fuels and concrete products utilizing CO   in the form of 
2
carbonate. However, CO  is a considerably stable substance, and large amount 
2
of energy inputs is required to convert CO  into another substances in almost all 
2
cases. . As such, objective and impartial life-cycle assessment (LCA) for the 
entire  process  is  required  for  CO   reduction.  A  comprehensive  LCA 
2
methodology for the CCU has not been contemplated globally, so research and 
development a viewpoint of LCA. In the case of l reactions using hydrogen for 
the purpose of CO conversion into chemicals and fuels, a challenge also arises 
2 
                                                 
30 The Roadmap illustrates potential technologies that enable effective CO2 utilization 
together with technical problems, challenges for commercialization and the future 
targets.  
- 80 - 
  
in  securing  ample  supply  of  affordable  CO -free  hydrogen  besides,  it  is 
2
necessary to develop technologies for utilization of CO ; efforts to lower the cost 
2
of hydrogen production are thus also required. While concrete products utilizing 
CO  in the form of carbonate have already been commercialized in Japan, they 
2
have yet to achieve sufficiently low costs to replace existing products. Further 
technological development is necessary to reduce their costs and explore their 
application. At this moment, the difference in price between CCU products and 
existing products remains extremely wide. Therefore, efforts will be required for 
wider use of CCU products, such as: lowering the procurement cost of hydrogen 
as  a  key  substances;  diffusion  of  environmental  values  with  public-private 
collaboration;  pursuit  of  application  to  high  value  added  products,  and; 
development of C1 chemistry for utilization of methane, which can serve as a 
bridge to future utilization of CO . 
2
 
(c) Negative emissions technology 
In addition to the CCS and CCU, negative emissions technology to recapture 
CO  already accumulated in the atmosphere in various ways has received 
2
much attention recently. Negative emissions technologies include: direct air 
capture (DAC), artificially separating and capturing CO  from the atmosphere 
2
directly ; afforestation; ocean fertilization to fixate carbon in phytoplanktons and 
useful  aquatic  plants;  promoting  downwelling  and  upwelling;  enhanced 
weathering; bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and; carbon 
storage in  cropland soil by using substances such as biochar. Researches on 
such negative emissions technologies had been long ongoing, but now that 
they are required in order to achieve the long-term goals set out in the Paris 
Agreement, the level of attention has increased greatly. However, life-cycle 
assessment  on  the  effect  of  CO   reduction  is  still  limited.  Besides,  DAC, 
2
amongst other methods, faces many challenges, including the necessity for 
significant  energy  input  and  cost  reductions.  Therefore,  establishing  basic 
technologies and various and objective examination will be required, also with 
a  view  to  promoting  effectiveness  and  social  acceptance,  as  well  as 
international collaboration. 
 
〇Target: Realizing energy and products utilizing CCU/carbon recycling at 
the level equivalent to existing energy and products in terms of 
cost and CO  reduction 
2
〇Examples of technologies relating to CCS, CCU and negative emissions 
• Separation and capture:  DAC; through chemical absorption; physical 
absorption;  solid  absorption;  membrane  separation;  physical 
adsorption; closed integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), 
- 81 - 
  
and; super plants and microorganisms with greater CO  removal 
2
properties 
•  Effective  use:  EOR;  methanation  /  conversion  to  fuel;  artificial 
photosynthesis; conversion to raw material for chemicals; use of 
biomass,  such  as  microalgae;  carbonation  /  mineralization; 
building materials; super plants generating valuable substances; 
direct synthesis, such as those with microorganisms, of valuable 
compounds  from  exhaust  gas  without  CO   separation,  and; 
2
chemical synthesis using methane 
• Transportation and storage: underground storage; survey on suitable 
sites and its monitoring, and; CO  transportation technology 
2
 
c.  Hydrogen 
 
Hydrogen has potentials, beyond the use as a fuel for vehicles or power 
generation,  for  cross-sectoral  innovation  to  contribute  to  large-scale  CO  
2
emission reductions in many fields, including in industrial processes, as a raw 
material for steel and chemical production processes or desulfurization in oil 
refining. Although the markets are not quite large yet, ENE-FARM, fuel cell 
vehicles, forklifts and buses have already been introduced to the society, while 
hydrogen power generation is in the demonstration stage. However, in order to 
achieve a hydrogen society including its use in industrial processes, the users 
require hydrogen to be priced at the level equal to or below natural gas per heat 
value, currently very far from the actual procurement cost of CO -free hydrogen. 
2
In addition to the cost issue, there is also an issue of ample supply. Water 
electrolysis  has  been  globally  touted  as  a  possible  method  of  hydrogen 
production  for  ultimate  decarbonization,  and  a  number  of  research  and 
development as well as demonstration projects have already been carried out. 
However, the fluctuating nature of renewable energies such as solar and wind 
power has resulted in a relatively low ratio of capacity utilization, and the cost of 
electricity from renewable energy power sources is not yet sufficiently low enough. 
Therefore, the cost needs to be reduced further in order to achieve a hydrogen 
price satisfactory to the users. Another issue is securing the massive volume of 
electricity needed to generate hydrogen, at the level over several million to over 
several tens of millions of tons worth, required for the introduction of hydrogen 
power generation and the use of hydrogen in existing industrial processes to 
achieve decarbonization. 
A fundamental issue in constructing a hydrogen society is the stable supply of 
large volume of CO -free hydrogen at an affordable price. While the production 
2
cost of electricity from renewable energy power sources remains high, seeking 
- 82 - 
  
out an alternative means of hydrogen production instead of water electrolysis, 
which does not generate CO , is a realistic option. Such means of hydrogen 
2
production may include: using fossil fuels with the CCS; using methane, including 
methane pyrolysis, independent from fossil fuels and the CCS; water pyrolysis 
using artificial photosynthesis and high temperature heat sources, and; using 
biomass.  Constant  efforts  are  needed  to  search  out  potential  innovative 
technologies to further reduce the cost of hydrogen production. The purity and 
pressure specifications of hydrogen also needs to be set adequately according 
to the quality required by users, thereby pursuing lower costs. Efforts are also 
needed  to  reduce  the  high  cost  of  hydrogen  carriers  required  for  overseas 
production as well as other purposes; these include the large energy inputs 
required  for  liquefaction,  synthesis,  dehydrogenation  processing  and 
transportation. In light of the situation, the potential of co-electrolysis technology, 
such as that synthesizing hydrocarbons from water (proton H inside water) and 
CO  using electricity from renewable energy power sources, without synthesis 
2
using hydrogen to produce a hydrogen carrier, followed by dehydrogenation. In 
any case, as these technologies are aimed at decarbonization, the best choice of 
technology needs to be made with the use of neutral and objective life-cycle cost 
assessment based on disclosed preconditions. 
 
〇 Target:    Realizing  hydrogen  cost  equivalent  to  existing  energy, 
including lowering manufacturing cost to one tenth 
〇Examples of technologies relating to hydrogen 
• Production technologies: Highly efficient water electrolysis; permeable 
membrane  for  high  purity  hydrogen;  artificial  photosynthesis; 
thermochemical hydrogen production using solar heat / industrial 
waste heat — IS process; hydrogen production from CO  free 
2
methane — pyrolysis, etc.; production of ethanol, ammonia, and 
hydrogen  from  exhaust  gas;  synthesis  of  hydrocarbon  and 
ammonia directly from water without going through hydrogen 
•  Transportation  and  storage  technologies:  Liquefaction  /    storage  / 
transport  of  liquefied  hydrogen;  highly  efficient  /  long-lasting 
organic hydride dehydrogenation catalyst; ammonia production 
technology;  methanol  production  technology;  methanation 
technology; transportation of hydrogen by pipeline or mixing into 
existing gas pipelines; noncombustible alloy for hydrogen storage 
able to fill or release at low cost and low pressure; lowering the 
installation and running costs of hydrogen stations 
• Applied technologies: Hydrogen power generation — mixed firing / single 
firing; CCU; hydrogen steelmaking; higher efficiency and lower 
- 83 - 
  
costs  for  fuel  cell  systems  with  expanded  applications;  direct 
ammonia combustion 
 
d.  Renewable energy 
 
Since the Sunshine Project, significant amount of investment on research and 
development has already been made for the use of renewable energy, including 
solar, wind, and geothermal heat, with results much introduced to the society. 
However, the power generation cost of renewables in Japan is still high compared 
to thermal power generation and other sources, and the number of locations 
suited to renewable energy in Japan is limited. Renewable energy can contribute 
to decarbonization not only as a primary source of electrical power but also by 
reducing the use of fossil fuels in industrial fields through production of CO -free 
2
hydrogen and combination with electrification technologies. 
 
(a) Cost reduction and overcoming locational constraints 
In order to expand the introduction of renewable energy in the long term, its 
cost needs to be reduced to the level of the existing energy sources. At the 
same time, efforts will be made to avail locations previously unsuitable for a 
renewable energy site, such as: improvement in power generation efficiency 
and durability; making the weight lighter, and; forming it into bendable forms. In 
addition, technologies to contribute to significant increase in the volume of 
renewable energy that can be introduced at a cost equivalent to the existing 
energy sources will be sought. In the case of solar power, this will include 
technologies that allow the installation of solar panels on building walls, factory 
roofs, on top of water, and on vehicles and drones. 
 
(b) Overcoming power grid constraints 
Current  power  grids  does  not  necessarily  match  the  sites  which  have 
potential for renewable energy power sources. Together with reviews on the 
current  system  aimed  at  the  consideration  on  next-generation  networks, 
including grid upgrading, the development and introduction of transmission 
technologies which enable grid upgrading at a lower cost and in a shorter time 
will become important. 
 
(c) Securing flexibility 
In order to integrate fluctuating renewable energies such as solar and wind 
power  in  large  volumes,  flexible  grid  operation  and  appropriate  flexibility 
sources  need  to  be  secured  for  stable  power  supply.  Pumped-storage 
hydroelectricity and thermal power generation currently provide flexibility, but 
- 84 - 
  
decarbonization  of  flexibility  sources  will  become  important.  In  the  future, 
storage of electricity from renewable energy that cannot be accepted in the grid 
will become important to make maximum use of acquired renewable energy. 
Research and development, as well as demonstration, of storage batteries for 
the grid, which appear promising large-scale energy storage technology, have 
been conducted, but as with other decarbonizing technologies, the primary 
problem for large-scale use in the society is the cost. The batteries also take 
up significant areas of space, and lithium-ion storage batteries currently use 
flammable electrolyte, which require safety design and constraints on the site 
of  location.  These  are  the  background  to  their  limited  usage,  despite  the 
promising prospect to contribute to expansion of renewable energy. Large-
scale storage energy technologies available at a low cost, equivalent to the 
pumped-storage power system needs to be realized in the future. There is 
much expectation on the decline in the cost of lithium-ion batteries to go along 
with increasing demand for electrified vehicles, the use of all-solid-state and the 
development of redox-flow storage batteries using low-priced materials. For 
automobile batteries, the standardization of technologies to assess battery 
deterioration and ways to evaluate their residual value for proper appraisal to 
allow secondary use of these batteries after the original purpose is required. It 
is also important to pursue various modalities of energy storage, not limited to 
electricity, provided that they are available in large scale and economically. 
Heat storage, previously unattended due to its low level of efficiency, and a 
storage energy system using hydrogen might make it a candidate. It may be 
worth noting here that using heat and hydrogen without returning them to 
electricity where possible will avoid the loss resulting from energy conversion. 
Thermal power is becoming increasingly more important in terms of flexibility 
in response to renewable energy. Accordingly, it is important for new and 
existing thermal power stations to aim for shortened time for power adjustment 
and increased efficiency in partial load operation with improvement in operation 
and rehabilitation. (This may also apply to hydrogen power generation in the 
future.) 
In addition, in order to achieve a decarbonized society, adjustment on the 
demand-side capacity is also important, not only on the supply and the grid. IoT 
technology is much used in the energy management already in place, such as 
the virtual power plant (VPP) and demand response (DR), while the AI and 
block chain technology also offer promising avenues to explore. As large-scale 
introduction of renewable energy will lead to a large-scale surplus of electricity, 
the management of energy storage system and the demand creation DR as a 
response  on  the  part  of  the  industries,  as  well  as  enhancement  of  such 
potentials will become important. In pursuit of the potentials of demand-side 
- 85 - 
  
capacity  adjustment,  close  scrutiny  into  the  industries,  the  manufacturing 
processes and potentials to respond to the demand creation and lowering the 
cost  for  controllable  distributed  energy  resources,  such  as  fixed  storage 
batteries, are important, alongside the management of hydrogen and heat as a 
means to store and utilize electricity. 
 
〇Target: Achieving renewable energy costs equivalent to existing energy 
sources; 
Establishing technology contributing to large-scale expansion of 
capacity of renewable energy; 
Using demand response (DR) to the level comparable to the USA 
〇Examples of technologies relating to renewable energy 
• Renewable energy: Third-generation solar cells — tandem (multi-function), 
perovskite,  III-V  family,  etc.;  fourth-generation  solar  cells  — 
quantum dot, etc.; floating offshore wind power; ocean energy 
sources; supercritical geothermal heat, and; space solar power 
• Storage energy and systems measures: Storage batteries for power 
systems  —  NAS,  redox-flow,  etc.;  storage  batteries  for 
automotive and personal use — lithium-ion, all-solid-state, etc.; 
automotive  battery  deterioration  assessment  technology; 
hydrogen storage; high efficiency thermal storage; compressed 
air; multi-terminal offshore power transmission systems 
• Decentralization and digital controls: Frequency controls and inertial 
force measures; output control  of thermal power generation / 
(hydrogen);  AI,  IoT;  P2P,  VPP  and  DR  using  block  chain 
technology — demand creation / limitation; innovative sensors; 
vehicle  control  technology  —  smart  charging,  V2X;  sector 
coupling — exchange of energy among electricity, heat, mobile 
unit, hydrogen; power electronics 
 
e.  Nuclear energy 
 
Regarding nuclear energy, which is an option for decarbonization at the stage 
of practical use stage, it is required to proactively make efforts to resolve technical 
challenges, while improving light-water reactor technology and  responding to 
domestic and international environmental changes in the uses of nuclear energy. 
In doing so, the perspective of promoting innovation of nuclear related technology, 
taking into account  growing and various social demands  such as hydrogen 
production,  heat utilization, ,and coexistence with renewable energy, in addition 
to further enhancing safety, reliability and efficiency, is important. In proceeding 
- 86 - 
  
with these activities, Japan will ensure strategic flexibility, including competition 
of various technologies and selections by domestic and international markets, 
taking into account the activities in the United States and Europe   which are 
advancing  innovative  nuclear  reactors  including  small  modular  reactors  and 
molten-salt reactors.  
On nuclear fusion energy, in parallel with steady implementation of the ITER 
project, which uses the tokamak and the Broader Approach Activities, Japan will 
promote the research on helical and other types based on unique Japanese ideas, 
aims at establishing scientific and technological feasibility. 
 
〇Target:  
-  Pursuing reactors with excellence in safety, economic efficiency, and   
flexibility; 
-   Technology development for solving backend problems 
〇Examples of technologies relating to nuclear energy   
• Nuclear energy: fast reactor; small modular reactor; high-temperature gas-
cooled  reactors;  molten-salt  reactors;  nuclide  transformation 
technology using accelerators, etc.   
• Nuclear fusion: experimental reactor; tokamak superconducting magnets; 
helical fusion reactor, etc.

II. Innovation in Economic and Social Systems 
 
Together with innovation to create technologies, “innovation in economic and 
social systems”, in which technologies are put to wide use, is indispensable to 
achieve  decarbonization  of  the  society.  In  particular,  in  order  to  make  the 
maximum use of private sector abilities and attract finance and investment, it is 
imperative for the Government to provide a “consistent climate change policy 
towards  an  ambitious  vision”  and  “preparing  environment  for  investment.” 
Technological innovation starts to reduce GHG emissions only after it has come 
to be used throughout the society. Policies to encourage corporate efforts and 
promote  the  creation  of  self-sufficient  business  models  are  required  for  the 
outcome of the innovation to be used throughout the society. At the same time, 
while  performance  and  efficiency  are  important  aspects,  they  will  remain 
untapped unless chosen by the user. Accordingly, the Government will pursue 
measures to achieve innovation in economic and social systems, including a spur 
to the user’s choice of innovation for decarbonization. 
 
III. Lifestyle Innovation 
 
“Lifestyle  innovation,”  shifting  the  way  of  life  of  each  citizen  towards 
sustainability, provides a major impact directly and indirectly on climate change 
through consumer behaviors and the use of fuels, energy, and resources. The 
shift from consuming goods to utility and price-driven to quality-driven, as well as 
the expansion in “ethical consumption,”31  is part of an overall economic shift 
“from quantity to quality”; a shift from mass production and mass consumption to 
small lot, high added value production and consumption, fully aligned with the 
move towards the decarbonization of society. These changes are creating new 
demand, leading to innovation in new goods and services. 
The Government intends to take measures to urge changes in the life-style 
leading to decarbonization, such as the sharing economy, “visualize” the GHG 
reduction  effects  accompanying  such  changes,  and  promote  businesses 
conforming with this trend. The Government will further engage in dialogue and 
                                                 
31 Consumer behavior to care the people, society, and environment, including regional 
revitalization and employment.  “Caring for the Environment” includes Eco Mark 
goods,  recycled  products,  sustainable  forestry  management  and  certified  fishery 
product, “Caring for the Society” Fair Trade goods and goods with donation, “Caring 
for the People” support for the disabled.  Local production for local consumption and 
purchasing goods of the disaster-affected region are also considered to fall into this 
category.

Section 2: Promotion of Green Finance 
 
1. Current Status 
 
(1) International Trends 
 
The creation of innovation in technological, economic, and social systems is 
important to realize the society aimed at the Paris Agreement. In this context, it 
is necessary that private sector investment focus on corporations which address 
climate change issues and/or take on innovations. The role of finance has thus 
become more important. 
Following the call from the United Nations, the “Principles for Responsible 
Investment” was formulated in 2006 and the concept of “environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) investment” was presented. Since the global financial 
crisis of 2008, the potential impact of non-financial information, together with 
financial information, on the corporate value has drawn much attention. This has 
led to a gradual rise in the ESG investment, primarily from the United States and 
Europe. In 2015, the Paris Agreement and the SDGs by the United Nations were 
both adopted. As the creation of innovation is important to realize both of them, it 
is hoped that ESG investing will play a role in the longer term increase of 
corporate values. 
In fact, the ESG investment increased by approximately 2,000 trillion yen in 
2018 compared to 2012, marking a major change in financial flows worldwide. 
The  growth  of  the  market  for  the  “E  (environmental)”  investment  has  been 
conspicuous, due to the extreme weather events of recent years. In the direct 
financial market, for instance, the divestment from stranded assets and active 
corporate engagement have been noticeable, and it is becoming a standard, 
especially  in European financial  markets, to include climate change risks in 
investment and lending decisions. The value of green bonds -- a type of bond 
whose proceeds are invested in projects that generate environmental benefits -- 
has also risen, reaching 50 times the value in 2012 as of 2018. 
In line with such trends, there have been increasing demands for disclosure of 
climate-related  financial  information.  On  the  instruction  of  the  G20  Finance 
Ministers and Central Bank Governors, the Financial Stability Board in December 
2015 set up the private sector-led “Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures  (TCFD).”  The  task  force  released  its  final  report  (the  “TCFD 
Recommendations”)  in  June  2017.  The  TCFD  Recommendations  set  out  a 
framework for voluntary disclosure by the financial and non-financial sectors of 
information on climate-related risks and opportunities. 
 
- 90 - 
  
(2) Trends in Japan 
 
Japanese ESG investment market is small compared to the world overall, but 
it expanded from USD 0.5 trillion in 2016 to USD 2.1 trillion in 2018, marking a 
substantial increase by 4.2 times. As such trends continue, active initiatives by 
institutional  investors  have  been  witnessed;  for  example,  the  Government 
Pension Investment Fund, the world's largest asset owner, for the purpose of 
maximizing the longer term investment returns, added descriptions on the ESG 
in its Investment Principles, and encourages the asset managers to consider ESG 
factors with active engagements and the adoption of ESG indices. 
The Government has made initiatives for the expansion of the green bonds 
market and taken policies to support the issuance of the green bonds, such as 
the formulation of Green Bond Guidelines and the establishment of the Green 
Bond Issuance Promotion Platform. With these initiatives in the public and private 
sectors, Japanese green bonds market has grown; the issuance of green bonds 
has risen by approximately seven times over two years from 2016 to 2018, and 
both issuers and the uses of proceeds have diversified. The Japanese financial 
institutions have provided largest amount of finance in the world to projects 
relating to renewable energy, and, accordingly, there are expectations for their 
engagement  in  the  climate  change  efforts  as  the  funder  domestically  and 
internationally. 
In the light of these trends, the Government has taken the following policies, in 
particular with regard to climate change, to support the ESG investment. 
 The “High Level Meeting on ESG Finance” considered the issues of the 
leadership and role of the financial sector in a decarbonized society and the 
transition to a sustainable society, and came up with its recommendations for 
Japan to become a major presence in ESG finance in July 2018. 
Furthermore,  the  Government  published  the  “Report  on  Ideas  for  Use  of 
Environmental Information in Evaluating the Corporate Value” by the Working 
Group on Environmental Information and Corporate Value. This report describes 
the  basic  ideas  for  investors  to  note  and  specific  examples  of  the  use  of 
environmental information, and the Government intends to attain wider utilization 
of ESG investment by using environmental information for the assessment of 
corporate values with this Report. 
Corporate governance reform is also being promoted through constructive 
dialogue  between  institutional  investors  and  companies,  in  order  to  achieve 
sustainable growth and increase corporate value in the longer term. Specifically, 
the Corporate Governance Code clearly states that the listed companies should 
take appropriate measures to address sustainability issues. The Stewardship 
Code provides the example of risks and opportunities arising from social and 
- 91 - 
  
environmental matters in a guidance for institutional investors to monitor investee 
companies. 
For the disclosure of climate-related financial information, the Government also 
formulated the world's first “Guidance for Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD Guidance)” in December 2018, in order to facilitate the dialogues between 
business operators and investors at a managerial level and to effectively disclose 
the initiatives and strong points of the companies in each sector. This TCFD 
Guidance may also be viewed as a specific attempt under the “Guidance for 
Integrated  Corporate  Disclosure  and  Company-Investor  Dialogue  for 
Collaborative Value Creation” (the  Ministry of Economy, Trade and  Industry 
(METI), May 2017), which sets a common narrative between the companies and 
investors; it thus encourages the formation of corporate value creation stories in 
terms of action on climate change. In addition, the “SDG Management / ESG 
Investment Study Group” has considered integrating SDGs into the management 
as well as the solutions that the business can offer to the social challenges 
including climate change from a long-term perspective on enhancing corporate 
values. Furthermore, the Government is working to disseminate the efforts of the 
Japanese public and private sectors such as holding TCFD symposiums in and 
outside Japan and raise the awareness on the TCFD.  At the same time, the 
Government encourages the endorsement of the TCFD by companies, as a 
means to promote ESG investment with active corporate initiatives. Furthermore, 
the Government formulated the “Practical Guide for Scenario Analysis in line with 
TCFD Recommendations” (the  Ministry of the Environment, March 2019) to 
support companies analyze their own climate-related risks and opportunities 
within the TCFD framework and practically reflect the results in their business 
strategies. 
In order to facilitate the dialogue between investors and companies, a database 
to enable the comparison of information disclosed by each company will be 
required.  The  Government  has  thus  developed  the  world’s  first  platform  to 
encourage disclosing environmental information to reflect the global trends, and 
established the ESG Dialogue Platform with direct dialogue functions. 
The  international  environmental  initiatives  working  on  the  disclosure  and 
assessment of information on climate change measures by global companies, 
such as the CDP, RE100, and SBT are becoming more influential,  and the 
Japanese companies need to respond to such initiatives. However, the lack of 
sufficient  prepared  and  available  information  to  make  an  argument  in  the 
international  context,  such  as  the  methods  to  calculate  GHG  emissions  or 
procurement  of  renewable  energy  in  Japan,  has  been  a  challenge.  The 
Government has therefore provided technical support to the companies who are 
engaged  in  these  international  environment  initiatives  and  aim  at  ambitious 
- 92 - 
  
efforts and also formulated the “Guidance for Encouraging Japanese Companies 
to Address International Initiatives on Climate Change.” 
 
2. Directions of Policy Measures 
 
(1) Basic Directions of Policy Measures 
 
Initiatives  and  innovations  by  companies  to  contribute  to  climate  change 
measures need to be appropriately “visualized” in order to realize a virtuous cycle 
of  environment  and  growth.  Outstanding  initiatives  and  technologies  for 
decarbonization of a company will not connect with investment unless they are 
“visualized” in such a way that can be properly assessed by investors or financial 
institutions. 
In order to realize the virtuous cycle of environment and growth, a mechanism 
for an international flow of funds is important to support investors and financial 
institutions assess the risks and opportunities over the long term and actively take 
on  the  decarbonizing  innovation.  The  Government  will  urge  companies  and 
financial institutions to take positive stances and improving the environment for 
mainstreaming ESG finance. 
 
(2) Mobilizing finance through Disclosure including the TCFD and Dialogue 
 
The Government seeks to utilize the TCFD, the global climate-related financial 
disclosure framework, to establish the virtuous cycle of environment and growth 
by “visualizing” individual company’s climate-related technologies and initiatives 
as opportunities. The TCFD is an international initiative discussed within the G20 
and elsewhere. It is increasingly being incorporated into the global corporate 
assessment framework as well as the systems of various countries and regions, 
giving it a central position as the information disclosure framework relating to 
climate change. 
In  order  to  make  the  “visualization”  more  detailed  and  effective,  while 
maintaining its credibility, the accumulation of best practices of disclosure is 
important. Accordingly, the Government encourages the companies to support 
the TCFD. The Japanese industries have taken positive stances toward the 
climate change challenges, as evidenced by the fact that Japan has the largest 
number of TCFD supporters among non-financial sectors, and have various 
technologies  essential  for  solution.    Achieving  these  initiatives  requires 
contributions from the industries as well as the financial sector; it is important for 
Japan, with its strong industries, to play a central role in leading the world into a 
virtuous cycle of environment and growth. In this regard, Japan will lead the global 
- 93 - 
  
rule-making for information disclosure relating to climate change, and change the 
global financial flow. 
 
a.  Promoting effective information disclosure by companies (expanding on 
the TCFD Guidance / Scenario Analysis Guide) 
 
To help Japanese companies more effectively disclose their information, the 
Government needs to facilitate the understanding of the TCFD and clarify key 
points for various types of industries and sizes of companies. Accordingly, The 
Government is promoting the TCFD Guidance, for example, by broadening the 
range of industries covered, and facilitating the use of the Guidance by small and 
medium-sized companies. As for the scenario analysis to conform with the TCFD, 
the Government will further expand the “Practical Guide for Scenario Analysis in 
line  with  TCFD  Recommendations”  with  more  best  practices  to  facilitate 
companies appropriately analyze and assess the opportunities and risks, and 
formulate a resilient business strategy appealing to the investors as a result.   
 
b.  Facilitating  assessment  of  disclosed  information  by  financial  sectors 
(Guidance on Green Investment) 
 
The modality of assessment and use of disclosed information related to climate 
change  currently  vary  by  investor. The  disclosure  of  climate  change-related 
information and examples of corporate assessment based on such disclosed 
information have increased, but for further expansion of green investment, it is 
necessary to connect appropriate assessment of the disclosed information with 
investment and lending.   
A guidance for financial sectors will be formulated to provide the investors and 
ratings, evaluation and other organizations with the key points in assessing a 
company’s value using its disclosed climate change-related information. This will 
promote greater information disclosure, while also stimulating a flow of finance 
taking sufficient consideration of climate change risks and opportunities. 
 
c.  Dialogue between the industries and the financial sector (TCFD Consortium) 
 
The TCFD Consortium is formed, which will serve as a venue for the TCFD 
supporters among Japanese companies and financial institutions, who will make 
the world’s largest community of TCFD supporters. Through proactive dialogues 
among companies and financial institutions, various issues pertaining to the 
disclosure  of  climate  change-related  information  and  the  future  direction  for 
attracting investment and achieving a virtuous cycle of environment and growth 
- 94 - 
  
will be discussed. The dialogue in this consortium will expand the range of 
industries covered and allow for the formulation or revision of guidance, which 
may be applied globally, leading efforts for disclosure worldwide. 
 
d.  International collaboration on information disclosure (TCFD Summit) 
 
Japan aspires to become a model country for the TCFD with the largest number 
of supporters and opens up this frontier with discussions at the TCFD Consortium 
on the specifics of climate change-related information disclosure and discussions 
to encourage investment in innovation. In order to share such knowledge and 
best practices, the TCFD Summit will be held in fall 2019 as an international 
gathering of leading companies, investors, and organizations involved with the 
TCFD. The summit will serve as an opportunity to spark discussions among 
relevant parties, leading to disclosure and its sophistication worldwide. 
 
e.  Response to international climate change initiatives (CDP, RE100, etc.) 
 
The  Government  will  provide  assistance  to  the  participation  of  Japanese 
companies and their target-setting, disclosure and argument in the international 
climate change initiatives, such as the CDP and RE100, so that the Japanese 
companies aware of trends in climate change, such as the use of renewable 
energy, and actively engaged in such efforts will receive proper appraisal, and 
promote climate change actions and expansion of renewable energy investment. 
 
(3) Promoting Initiatives to Expand ESG Finance 
 
a.  Initiatives to expand ESG finance 
 
For direct finance, the Government will promote the issuance of green bonds 
and support the expansion of the domestic green bond market with the efforts of 
both public and private sectors. At the same time, the Government will aim to 
establish the reputation of Japanese capital market as “green” by expanding the 
trend of ESG-consciousness in other financial instruments, real estates, and 
further on. Institutional investors and other actors involved in direct finance will 
be encouraged to conduct self-assessments of the current status of their ESG 
investment and voluntarily disclose such information. 
Initiatives to give consideration to ESG factors will also be promoted for indirect 
finance,  which  has  an  overwhelming  presence  in  Japan.  In  particular,  local 
financial institutions that underpin the sustainability of the locality are encouraged 
to coordinate with local authorities, while actively seeking out challenges related 
- 95 - 
  
to ESG issues with potential business prospects, making use of their abundant 
financial expertise to participate in the formation of new businesses. 
 
b.  Development  of  a  dialogue  platform  on  environmental  information  and 
corporate value assessment 
 
In order to achieve a virtuous cycle of environment and growth, it is important 
to expand ESG finance by encouraging effective dialogue among companies, 
investors and other parties. Therefore, the Government will develop an ESG 
Dialogue Platform, with the aim of  starting full-scale  operation  by FY 2021, 
encouraging effective dialogue on environmental information relating to climate 
change,  resource  circulations,  issues  concerning  natural  capital  as  well  as 
corporate value assessment. 
 
c.  Maintaining and creating momentum on ESG finance among investors and 
financial institutions 
 
In these ways, greater ESG finance literacy among those including investors 
and financial institutions will be enhanced, leading to improved effectiveness of 
ESG finance as well as growth in the quantity and improvement in the quality. By 
setting up an ESG Finance High-Level Panel with commitment from the top 
management  of  investors  and  financial  institutions,  and  reviewing  initiatives 
relating to ESG finance, momentum on ESG finance among financial institutions 
and other organizations will be maintained and created. Japan will thus aim to 
become a major presence in ESG finance.  
 
Companies  are  expected  to  actively  participate  in  such  discussions  and 
initiatives, to form strategic business models enabling efforts to address climate 
change and raise the corporate value at the same time, and to send out such 
messages and engaged in dialogue with investors in particular. The investors, on 
the other hand, needs to proactively use the information disclosed relating to 
climate change and engage in dialogue, thus assessing companies, and making 
investment decisions with appropriate consideration to climate change risks and 
opportunities. The Government will support such initiatives, including with the 
activities of the TCFD Consortium. 
 
(4)  Promotion  of  Investment  on  research  and  development  and  Support  of 
Startups (recapitulation) 
 
Superior technologies on energy and environment owned by the start-ups are 
- 96 - 
  
a source of innovation. The Government will provide knowledge-based support 
(NEDO Pitches, etc.) for companies selected by public organizations for their 
excellence, making such companies “visible” to the market, and design incentives 
to expand private sector investment. 
 
(5) Supporting Formation of Decarbonization Projects with Investment 
 
Projects for decarbonization have to secure the private finance in the first place, 
but  the  Government  will  facilitate  investment  in  the  project  with  insufficient 
financial backing. 
   
- 97 - 
  
Section 3: Business-led promotion of International Application, and International 
Cooperation 
 
1. Current Status 
 
It is important that the disruptive innovation created in Japan be offered for 
international application, thereby driving global decarbonization. 
 
(1) Promoting International Application of Competitive Technologies and Products 
with high environmental performance 
 
Japanese  environmental  technologies  and  products  of  excellence  have 
contributed to competitiveness and offered both well-being and solution of global 
environmental  problems  to  the  world.  Japan  has  to  continue  creating  new 
business with the advanced technological capacities and promote international 
application of environmental technologies and products of excellence, thereby 
leading the world in global reduction of emissions. To this end, it is important that 
goods and services are developed at a competitive price by reducing costs, made 
more competitive and offered to the market overseas. At the same time, the sales 
volume  needs  to  grow  to  improve  the  prospects  of  business  and  make  it 
sustainable. 
The global energy supply-demand structure is undergoing major changes, with 
increased demand for energy primarily due to the rise of the emerging countries, 
as  well  as  the  shale  revolution  and  the  substantial  decline  in  the  costs  of 
renewable energy. The entry into force of the Paris Agreement in particular has 
driven the momentum for decarbonization by countries around the world in order 
to achieve its long-term goals. 
 
(2) Developing Initiatives by Diverse Actors Including the Private Sector 
 
The activities of various actors, such as local authorities, companies, financial 
institutions and research institutions to achieve the long-term goals stipulated in 
the  Paris Agreement  have  intensified  worldwide. The  Government  needs  to 
enhance  decarbonization  measures  in  qualitative  and  quantitative  terms 
including  by  collaborating  with  these  actors,  providing  financial  support  and 
capacity building, and preparing grounds for the expansion of market related to 
decarbonization. 
Efforts have been made in the world for companies to estimate GHG emissions 
in the entire supply-chain and reduce them. Such efforts will not only concern the 
countries where the companies are registered, but also other countries where 
- 98 - 
  
affiliated companies or factories are located. Efforts to improve transparency and 
reduce  GHG  emissions  under  the  international  initiatives  will  help  the 
international  standings,  and  in  the  long  term,  manifest  the  resilience  of  the 
company in responding to the economic and social transition to a decarbonized 
society. 
 
(3) Policy and Institutional Support as a Basis for Greenhouse Gas Emission 
Reductions  
 
Policy and institutional support expands the opportunities associated with the 
reduction of GHG emissions, and provide partner countries with wider application 
of decarbonizing technologies. It will also serve as a basis for the fruits of co-
innovation by various actors to be widely shared in social and economic systems, 
as explained in detail later. 
In many developing countries, basic information on climate change measures, 
including the actual situation regarding their GHG emissions, is not available, 
which makes detailed planning of the actions to take and accurate assessment 
of the effects on measures challenging. In order to ensure the effectiveness of 
the Paris Agreement for the achievement of its long-term goals, the enhanced 
transparency of such information as basic information, systems32 and investment 
will be essential. To this end, it is important to send out a message that enhanced 
transparency will be accompanied by incentives: the promotion of projects and 
investment of the private sector. 
In the quest for a decarbonized society, co-benefits, rather than substitutions, 
will often rise among several SDGs. It is desirable that the co-benefits between 
climate change measures and other SDGs are shown to the society as a model 
case. 
 
(4) Investment in Climate Change Measures by Private Finance, Including Use 
of Public Funds 
 
Japan has provided much support for the international application of low-
carbon and decarbonizing technologies of excellence with various public financial 
resources. For example, as in the Expanded Partnership for Quality Infrastructure 
announced in 2016, the Government set a target to supply approximately 200 
billion  dollars  of  financial  resources  for  five  years  to  support  the  Japanese 
companies’ engagement in the vast demands for infrastructure, and enhance the 
                                                 
32 For example, systems pertaining to the inventory of and estimating, reporting and 
publishing of GHG. 
- 99 - 
  
assistance modalities of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Japan 
Bank  of  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),  Nippon  Export  and  Investment 
Insurance  (NEXI),  and  Japan  Oil,  Gas  and  Metals  National  Corporation 
(JOGMEC). 
Furthermore,  new  modalities  such  as  the  provision  of  risk  money  and 
guarantee are desirable. 
Official Development Assistance (ODA) plays a role as a catalyst for mobilizing 
private sector ESG finance aimed at addressing climate change and environment, 
in addition to the conventional  modalities.  It is also desirable that the  ODA 
supports  the  pioneering  of  social  and  institutional  reforms  for  sustainable 
development  with  decarbonization  efforts  and  expanding  them  (such  as 
institutional support, human resource development and project formulation). 
The Green Climate Fund (GCF), the financial mechanism under the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) emphasizes a 
paradigm shift in the locality over technology transfer in approving projects. In 
addition, movement to support climate change measures in financial sectors are 
also spreading, as seen in ESG investment and green bonds. The issuing of 
green samurai bonds by the governments of developing countries may well 
contribute to effective collaboration with private fund. The potential of climate 
change measures is particularly vast in developing countries where demands for 
infrastructure  are  expanding.  Bearing  in  mind  that  enhanced  resilience  by 
introducing sustainable and resilient infrastructure will improve the investment 
environment  for  the  private  sector,  it  is  also  important,  in  the  context  of 
international cooperation, for the private financial flow towards addressing climate 
change issues in developing countries to activate. 
 
2. Directions of Policy Measures 
 
(1) Basic Directions of Policy Measures 
 
Japan aims at a large-scale reduction of emissions of its own, and endeavor to 
lead global decarbonization. Based on the established confidence and supported 
by overseas establishments, Japan will expand cooperative partnership with 
other countries, create new business with Japanese advanced technologies and 
promote  international  application  of  the  products  and  goods  with  high 
environmental performance, thereby leading global efforts and contributing to 
global reduction of emissions. 
To this end, the Government will facilitate business-led international application 
with  further  improvement  of  environment  such  as  creating  markets,  human 
resource development, and institutional development. Instead of simply exporting 
- 100 - 
  
innovation --  introducing Japanese decarbonizing technology and institution to 
the partner country and promote their usage -- collaboration with the partner 
country will be sought for “co-innovation” benefiting both countries: to adapt 
Japanese  decarbonizing  technology  suitable  to  the  partner  country  and 
supporting necessary changes in the economic and social systems and life-styles. 
In  such  a  way,  contribution  to  changes  in  the  society  and  system  towards 
decarbonization  will  be  sought  worldwide.  In  turn,  Japanese  advanced 
decarbonizing technologies and industries will be further sophisticated, and, with 
partnership  and  fair  and  healthy  competition,  be  more  active  in  the  global 
decarbonizing market, offering high quality infrastructure, products and services. 
It has been widely recognized that the initiatives by private companies and the 
use of private funds greatly contribute to building a decarbonized society, not 
least at the Climate Change Summit. In addition to strengthening partnerships 
with various entities and institutional support, the public finance will be used as a 
valuable leverage to private investment, such as by providing finance to reduce 
risks. By raising awareness of institutional investors on environmental finance, 
such  as  ESG  investment,  and  stimulating  the  appetite  of  investors  on 
environmental  projects  including  green  bonds,  the  Government  will  facilitate 
investment  and lending  on climate  change  measures in Japan and  abroad, 
including developing countries. 
The Government will establish the “Circulating and Ecological Economy” as a 
model to achieve the SDGs and decarbonization in the locality and disseminate 
the notion to the world as a role model of Japanese origin, offer Japanese 
expertise for Asian and other countries in building such an economy of their own. 
By  establishing  the  social  model  which  can  be  shared  with  the  world  and 
providing a recipe for achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, the growth and 
contribution to the international community will be achieved in parallel, to the 
benefit of a decarbonized society. 
Efforts need to made to expand the financial base for climate change, not just 
in terms of the ODA and Other Official Flows (OOF), and to increasingly take into 
account the perspectives of climate change in all cases, in view of the long-term 
goals stipulated in the Paris Agreement. 
 
(2) Promoting International Application of Decarbonizing Technologies together   
with Policy and Institutional Support and Rule-Making 
 
a.  Policy and institutional development and further application to other countries 
 
In  order  to  make  environmental  technologies  and  products  of  excellence 
contribute to a decarbonization society in the whole world, the Government will 
- 101 - 
  
formulate  projects  to  offer  advanced  technologies  together  with  policy  and 
institutional  development.  For  example,  with  the  Joint  Crediting  Mechanism 
(JCM) amongst other means, the Government can support the introduction of 
Japanese decarbonizing technologies in a partner country together with policy 
and institutional development for the use of such technologies, thereby offering 
an opportunity to significantly reduce GHG emissions by widely applying such 
technologies.  By  applying  this  method  to  another  partner  country,  further 
business-led application and reduction of GHG emissions in global terms will be 
achieved. The Government will build up such best practices and develop a model 
for success to prepare more significant changes in the economic and social 
systems of partner countries.  
In order to achieve wider application of decarbonizing efforts in many countries 
and  regions,  the  Government  will  facilitate  the  business-led  international 
application based on public-private collaboration, for example with public-private 
workshops to share best practices on: global comparison and assessment of 
energy efficiency, introducing energy efficiency labels and building systems such 
as international standardization.  
As  the  weight  of  energy  consumption  in  Asia  increases,  international 
cooperation on climate change measures and energy policies, together with 
specific collaborations, will become more important than ever. Japan will support 
Asia, especially decarbonization and energy transition in ASEAN, by leading 
tailor-made institutional development according to the diversities of each country 
and the level of development. Relevant ministries will collaborate with private 
companies to support cooperation on international application, improve business 
environment through public and private sector initiatives in ASEAN and promote 
a virtuous cycle of environment and growth in each country. 
In order to encourage accountable actions and initiatives by the partner country, 
the Government will provide cooperation on necessary institutions and capacity 
building  to  enable  sustainable  efforts  of  various  entities  with  the  sense  of 
ownership.  
To enable international application of local companies, the Government will 
facilitate the accumulation of expertise and the sophistication of technology in 
that  specific  region.  Subsequent  proactive  international  application  of  its 
technology will contribute to developing that region with expanded employment 
as well as achieving a decarbonized society. 
 
 
 
 
 
- 102 - 
  
b.  Leading international rule-making 
 
The Government will lead international rule-making, including the formulation 
of international standards for the wider usage of technologies and products for 
decarbonization worldwide. 
In order to speed up energy efficiency on a global scale, the Government will 
make efforts, such as preparing data for the “visualization” of energy consumption 
efficiency by industry and by country and region, as well as working towards 
international standards on the assessment on the energy consumption by the 
steel sector, the energy efficiency capacities of building materials and general 
estimates  on  GHG  emissions. The  GHG  emission  reductions  and  removals 
achieved with international contribution will be handled based on an agreement 
with  the  partner  country  and  under  international  rules  including  the  Paris 
Agreement, ensuring environmental integrity and preventing double counting. 
The Government will take the initiative in international rule-making based on the 
experiences in leading the establishment of the JCM, to create an appropriate 
framework for using market-based mechanisms. 
As a major shipping and shipbuilding country, Japan will seek to contribute to 
the GHG reduction targets of the international shipping as agreed globally at the 
IMO,  and  to  this  end,  contribute  to  decarbonizing  international  shipping  by 
developing  energy  efficiency  technologies  and  formulating  an  international 
framework at the IMO. By taking a leading role in discussions for reduction of CO  
2
emissions  in  ICAO,  Japan  will  also  contribute  to  reducing  emissions  from 
international aviation. 
 
c. Promoting  International  application  of  low-GWP  and  non-fluorocarbon 
refrigerant technologies and products 
 
The Government will proceed with the development and introduction of low-
GWP and non-fluorocarbon refrigerants and equipment using such refrigerants, 
and  facilitate  international  application  of  Japanese  refrigerating  and  air 
conditioning technologies. Regarding the reduction of fluorinated gas emissions, 
the  Government  will  provide  assistance  to  developing  countries  based  on 
Japanese expertise to prevent leaks in their use and emissions upon equipment 
disposal, thereby reducing fluorinated gas emissions. 
 
d. Promoting International application of climate change measures in agriculture, 
forestry and fisheries 
 
GHG emissions from agriculture, forestry and other land use sectors make up 
- 103 - 
  
a fourth of all emissions from anthropogenic sources globally, and there are vast 
potentials for reducing emissions, especially in developing countries. Working 
with international organizations, and with the JCM and other mechanisms, the 
Government will apply Japanese renowned decarbonizing technologies in the 
agriculture,  forestry  and  fisheries  sectors,  such  as  farm  soil  carbon  fixation 
technologies, measures addressing deforestation and forest degradation and 
technologies  to  promote  afforestation  and  reforestation  in  other  countries, 
thereby contributing to reduction of GHG emissions worldwide. 
 
(3)  Strengthening  Development  and  Investment  of  Energy  Infrastructure 
Contributes to Reduction of CO  Emissions 
2
 
In order to address two major global challenges of improving the energy access 
in the world and achieving a decarbonized society, it is indispensable that the 
innovation required for decarbonization of fossil fuels, such as the CCS, CCU and 
carbon recycling, is achieved. Japan will contribute to the world by exercising 
leadership in the international collaboration to develop and apply technologies to 
that end and share expertise. 
At the same time, the Government will present all available options to help 
reduce  CO   emissions  according  to  the  needs  of  the  partner  country,  and 
2
proactively work on the wider application of the fruits of innovation, such as 
renewable energy and hydrogen, so that the world will reduce its dependency on 
fossil fuels to achieve a decarbonized society.   
Bearing these in mind, the Government will promote the development and 
investment of energy infrastructure abroad in order to contribute to the global 
reduction of CO  emissions consistent with the long-term goals stipulated in the 
2
Paris Agreement.  Especially  in  the  light  of  growing  demands  on  renewable 
energy worldwide, the Government will facilitate the use of renewable energy 
according to the circumstances of the partner country. On geothermal power 
generation,  Japanese  technologies  have  much  competitiveness,  and  the 
Government  will  particularly  take  a  wide  range  of  measures  to  facilitate 
international application, including surveys on potentials, development, operation 
and preparation such as capacity building in Africa, Asia and other regions. The 
Government  will  also  seek  international  application  of  offshore  wind  power 
generation, waste power generation, cogeneration systems and smart cities. The 
Government will also facilitate international application of such technologies as 
grid  and  energy  storage  to  support  the  expansion  of  renewable  energy, 
considering  the  needs  in  the  partner  country.  During  the  transition  to  a 
decarbonized society, the Government will support the shift to cleaner use of gas 
by supporting the institutions and infrastructure to introduce LNG worldwide, 
- 104 - 
  
consistent with the long-term goals stipulated in the Paris Agreement. 
 
(4)  Development  and  Investment  of  Urban  and Transportation  Infrastructure 
Contributes to Reduction of CO  Emissions 
2
 
The  Government  will  facilitate  the  international  application  of  high  quality 
infrastructure  using  the  private  finance,  and  promote  the  application  of 
environmental infrastructure abroad including in developing countries where the 
demand is strong.  This will include establishing decarbonization models, such 
as  smart  cities,  in  Japan  and  promoting  international  application  of  such 
infrastructure as a “package”. 
The proactive collaboration of local authorities and municipal entities in various 
sectors provides a very effective approach for establishing a global decarbonized 
society. The Government will broaden the opportunities for dialogue, such as 
meetings, among various actors, encourage municipalities to be actively involved 
in collaboration with other cities, and create more opportunities for these actors 
to be proactively engaged in finding solutions to urban challenges. 
The Government will also actively facilitate international application of aviation 
infrastructure to enable efficient operation to reduce CO  emissions.

(5) Effective Use of Public Finance and Greater Mobilization of Private Finance 
 
The Government will make efforts to expand financial resources for climate 
change, not limited to ODA or OOF. 
Japan announced the “Actions for Cool Earth (ACE) 2.0” as a commitment for 
drastic global reduction of emissions with assistance to developing countries and 
innovation prior to COP 21 in 2015, and has been implementing it. Japan will 
continue to provide climate change finance as stipulated in the Paris Agreement, 
and it will be necessary to further utilize all public finance to this end. The OOF 
will be primarily used for Japanese companies seeking opportunities abroad, and 
ODA such as Private Sector Investment Finance will be used for international 
cooperation  to  support  developing  countries;  the  synergy  between  the  two 
modalities  to  mobilize  private  finance  and  create  impact  will  be  sought. 
Furthermore, in order to support the Japanese companies with technologies of 
excellence  useful  for  decarbonization  in  the  world,  in  both  developing  and 
developed countries, the Government will support providing public finance on 
projects  using  advanced  technologies  and  new  ventures,  thereby  promoting 
innovation and investment by Japanese companies.   
The Government will actively engage in the effective and efficient operation of 
the GCF and the Green Environment Facility (GEF) for improved access of funds 
- 105 - 
  
for developing countries, as well as for fostering understanding on financing 
mechanism and project cycles and networking with accredited agencies, with a 
view to the participation of the Japanese and partner companies leading to co-
innovation. 
Cooperation with the public and private financial institutions in the partner 
country and capacity building for financing in the climate-related sector are also 
important.  The  Government  will  support  collaboration  between  the  local 
authorities, private companies and financial institutions of Japan and the partner 
country to facilitate the use of private finance in the partner country, including by 
setting venues for dialogue and together with such institutions as the World Bank 
and the Asian Development Bank. 
The cost of advanced decarbonizing technologies are often difficult to cover for 
developing countries. Therefore, the Government will take measures, including 
the use of the JCM, to alleviate the fiscal burden on the developing country for 
wide usage of decarbonizing technologies. 
The Government will mobilize these public finance modalities as a leverage to 
encourage private investment, including by providing public finance to reduce 
risks and utilizing green samurai bonds. 
  
(6) Building Basis for Decarbonized Societies on a Global Scale 
 
The Government will promote capacity building and institutional improvement 
in  a  partner  country  by  utilizing  Japanese  expertise  and  collaborating  with 
relevant  organizations,  such  as:  assistance  for  formulating  the  Nationally 
Determined  Contribution  and  mitigation  plan;  institution  building,  and; 
improvement  and  strengthening  of  existing  institutions. These  measures  will 
reduce the risk for private investment, provide incentives to private companies 
and  enhance  the  flow  of  private  funds,  thereby  activating  the  market  for 
decarbonizing technologies. 
The Government will facilitate co-innovation under enhanced transparency, in 
view of the growth in international initiatives to estimate and control the reduction 
of the emission in the entire supply chain. The Government will also aim for 
enhanced transparency in the entire supply chain of public corporate activities to 
foster decarbonizing technologies and industries.

Chapter 4: Direction of Other Cross-sectoral Policy Measures 
 
(1) Human Resource Development 
 
a.  Education 
 
The  Government  will  further  promote  the  Education  for  Sustainable 
Development (ESD) to help achieve SDGs, including climate change. Through 
the activities of UNESCO schools, which are designated as the ESD hub, and 
other schools, the Government facilitates raising awareness and interests among 
pupils, students and teachers. At places outside schools, such as families, local 
communities  and  workplaces,  voluntary  efforts  will  be  encouraged  and  best 
practices actively shared, including by introducing awards. Collaboration with 
various stakeholders in the local community working on climate change will also 
be sought. 
The Government will facilitate human resource development for a sustainable 
community,  towards  achieving  the  Circulating  and  Ecological  Economy  and 
based  on  the  notion  of  the  ESD,  together  with  various  stakeholders.  The 
Government will thus promote the development of human resources to cultivate 
partnerships and further communication with other localities. 
 
b.  Human Resource Development for Innovation 
 
In order to create sustained innovations for the virtuous cycle of environment 
and growth, it is important that the Government develops and maintain human 
resources in a wide range of fields, starting with science and technology that 
relate  to  environment  and  energy.  In  order  to  continue  developing  human 
resources for the future, the Government needs to be continuously engaged in 
human resource development from a long-term perspective. As the issue of 
decarbonized society is of a global nature, the entire international community 
needs  to  make  efforts  together.  In  this  context,  it  is  important  that  Japan, 
renowned  for  high  academic  and  technological  standards,  develop  human 
resources to lead the world decarbonization. 
Accordingly, human resource development for comprehensive research and 
development  from  basic  research  to  practical  application  in  the  fields  of 
environment  and  energy  will  be  conducted,  including  preparing  necessary 
environment such as on-the-job training, aimed at educating young and capable 
researchers. 
In business management, the Government will facilitate companies incorporate 
perspectives  to  appropriately  address  environmental  issues  and  create  new 
- 108 - 
  
corporate  values.  In  this  context,  the  Government  will  facilitate  efforts  of 
companies to develop human resources in and out of the company to be engaged 
in management emphasizing environment and environmental protection and lead 
a “green” socio-economic system -- environmental human resources.  
 
(2) Enhancement of an Integrated Approach in Building a Resilient Society to 
Adapt to Climate Change 
 
In responding to climate change, mitigation and adaptation are complementary 
measures to each other. The Government will steadily promote climate change 
measures based on two laws and two plans respectively. 
In particular, the promotion of measures that bring about positive effects on 
both  mitigation  and  adaptation  will  help  reduce  the  GHG  emissions  while 
simultaneously improving societal resilience. These measures will also bring 
many  benefits  as  well,  such  as  developing  a  sound  local  community  and 
improving people’s health. For example, the introduction of self-sustained and 
distributed energy including renewable energy is a mitigation measures, and, at 
the same time, helps revitalize the local economy and secures energy in the event 
of  disaster,  thus  beneficial  for  adaptation.  Developing  and  disseminating 
technology to streamline and conserve water use and increasing awareness on 
water conservation will also contribute to reducing GHG emissions by reducing 
the energy required for water supply and sewage system treatment. In addition 
green infrastructure and ecosystem-based approaches including the one based 
on forest (EbA and Eco-DRR) will have various advantageous effects, such as: 
adaptation to climate change such as disaster risk reduction; mitigation of climate 
change in terms of carbon sink; generation of various social, economic and 
cultural co-benefits in local communities, and; contribution to conservation of 
biodiversity and its sustainable use. 
The type and scale of climate change effects significantly vary by climate, 
geography, socio-economic conditions, and other regional characteristics. The 
fields requiring urgent measures also differ by region. In light of the situation, the 
Government has utilized a knowledge platform on climate change (A-PLAT), to 
strengthen and improve knowledge by linking the data of various ministries, 
agencies and research institutions and will provide information such as climate 
risk in a practical format to be utilized by various entities. 
In addition, the Government will enhance the awareness of business operators 
on adaptation and encourage taking measures by preparing and providing the 
best practices of business operators in and out of Japan -- “visualizing” --, on 
“climate  risk  management”  --  finding  climate  risks  associated  with  business 
activities  and  taking  measures  --  and  “adaptation  business”  --  providing 
- 109 - 
  
technologies, products and services on adaptation. 
 
(3) Just Transition 
 
In moving toward a decarbonized society, the Paris Agreement takes into 
account the imperatives of a “just transition of the workforce”. The Just Transition 
Declaration  was  adopted  at  COP24,  underlining  the  growing  international 
recognition of the importance of just transition. It is important that a just transition 
is  made  with  decent  work  and  improvement  in  productivity.  Since  many 
companies in Japan are rooted in localities, a comprehensive consideration on 
transitioning local economies and companies will be required as well. While there 
may be challenges with these transitions, there will also be opportunities in terms 
of restructuring in the industry.   
Against this backdrop, the Government, local authorities and companies will 
work  together  to  provide  vocational  training  to  the  workforce,  support  for 
diversification  and  shifts  in  business  operations,  inviting  new  business  and 
support for placement of the labor force, in order to achieve the transition of the 
workforce to a decarbonized society smoothly and without delay. 
 
(4) Government’s Own Efforts to Lead the Society 
 
The  Government  will  lead  the  way  in  carrying  out  initiatives  to  create  a 
decarbonized society on its own administration and undertakings, while working 
for the comprehensive introduction to the entire society. The Government will 
contribute to make available the information of the budget on environmental 
protection, including climate change. 
 
(5) Carbon Pricing 
 
Discussions on carbon pricing took place at the G7 Ise-Shima Summit in 2016 
and the G7 Charlevoix Summit in 2018. Some countries and regions, including 
some European countries and States in the US have already introduced carbon 
pricing schemes, and China introduced the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) on 
a national scale. On the other hand, the marginal cost of CO  reduction is high in 
2
Japan, as are energy costs.  From the perspective of energy security, there is 
the fact that Japan imports the majority of its energy resources from abroad. 
Carbon pricing includes not only the pricing at the market, but also taxation, which 
has already been introduced to some degree. However, the effects, assessment, 
and  challenges  vary  by  system.  Professional  and  technical  discussions 
considering the perspectives of international trends, conditions in Japan and 
- 110 - 
  
international competitiveness are required.

Chapter 5: Review and Implementation of Long Term Strategy 
 
In relation to this Strategy, the Government will carry out analyses, taking future 
situational  changes  into  account,  based  on  the  best  available  scientific 
knowledge, on issues such as the constraints on land, climate, resources and 
social systems, adverse economic effects and opportunities for growth caused by 
climate  change.  Furthermore,  the  Government  will  widely  disseminate  the 
information that has been found, and promote further initiatives by pursuing 
collaboration  with  the  stakeholders  and  dialogue  that  include  younger 
generations, who will uphold the society over the long term. 
 
Reflecting on the vision established in this strategy and taking into account the 
Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures and the Strategic Energy Plan, the 
Government will revisit the policy measures referred to in this Strategy flexibility 
about every 6 years with reference to situations, and review this Strategy as may 
be required.
