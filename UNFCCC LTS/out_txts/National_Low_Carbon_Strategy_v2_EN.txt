2 Transition to a low-carbon economy     
The National Low-Carbon Strategy (SNBC) was established by the Energy Transition for Green
Growth Act No. 2015-992 of 17 August 2015. It outlines the approach to be adopted to reduce our
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It sets in motion the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon eco-
nomy. It facilitates the management of policies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by public
decision-makers.
The National Low-Carbon Strategy aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 75% by 2050, while
making it possible to stay within the carbon budgets set for the periods 2015-2018, 2019-2023 and
2024-2028 and honour the commitment made by France toward the European Union to reduce its
GHG emissions by 40% by 2030. 
Carbon budgets
Definition: carbon budgets define the upper limits for France’s greenhouse gas emissions,
expressed in millions of tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. They are set for periods of four to five
years to enable management of the structural changes in greenhouse gas emissions while
reducing certain temporary effects, such as changes in winter weather conditions.
p
• Progress made
Since the early 1990s, GHG emissions have fallen by 11% and the level of per capita GHG emis-
sions in France is one of the lowest among developed countries. This is the result of the commit-
ment made by France to energy management and decarbonisation of the energy mix since the late
1970s.
3The policies that have already been implemented to mitigate climate change should enable us to
achieve our targets for the reduction of national greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. However, we
must look beyond this and act to reduce the national carbon footprint, which remained stable
between 1990 and 2012 owing to the increase in emissions linked to imports.
• The French Project
Beyond 2020, France has set itself even more ambitious reduction targets, in particular with the
Energy Transition for Green Growth Act :
 40% reduction in its total emissions by 2030 compared with 1990
 75% reduction in its total emissions by 2050 compared with 1990 (“factor 4” scenario) 
Breakdown of France’s commitments
Reducing our GHGs to 140 Mt in less than two generations is a real challenge. It requires average
reductions of between 9 and 10 Mt CO2e per year until 2050. This means increasing the pace of
reduction compared with the period 2005-2013, while ensuring the continued economic develop-
ment of our country through green growth, without exporting our emissions by relocating activities
that emit the most GHGs abroad, or limiting our ability to meet food security targets.
Therefore, major changes across the entire economy are vital. Massive investment is required and
an overhaul in production and consumption patterns is essential.
The transition to a low-carbon economy depends on significantly strengthening energy saving ef-
forts and decreasing the carbon intensity of the energy used. This transition must take into account
all aspects of the National Strategy of Ecological Transition towards Sustainable Development
(SNTEDD), in particular including the targets relating to the restoration of biodiversity and efforts to
tackle air pollution.
This strategy provides the general framework and clarifies the nature of the considered solutions.
At a later stage, it must be supplemented by sectoral programmes of action, which will provide op-
portunities to carefully select the chosen solutions and optimise their implementation.
4Over the next 10 years, France will aim to reduce its carbon footprint, in particular through :
• a reduction in the carbon intensity of the economy: developing renewable energies, using
bio-based materials (e.g. timber in construction), encouraging cleaner, more mindful travel,
especially via low-carbon technologies, and awareness-raising among consumers ;
• a major development of energy savings in all sectors, especially industry, buildings and
transport ;
• the development of the circular economy: eco-design, recycling and reuse.
This approach will be firmly rooted at the local level through the positive energy territories for green
growth, regional climate-air-energy schemes, and territorial climate-air-energy plans.
Impact of the National Low-Carbon Strategy on jobs and growth
The energy transition and the development of a low-carbon economy will also enable
France to : 
 be less dependent on imported fossil fuels, thus reducing its energy bill and its carbon
footprint ;
 support growth and thereby increase GDP compared with the trend-based scenario
over the next two decades ;
 increase job creation (an average of between 100,000 and 350,000 extra jobs
between 2015 and 2035).
Difference in GDP (in %) between the trend-based scenario and
the reference low-carbon transition scenario (Seureco)
France is not the only country to put in place measures for the transition to a low-carbon economy.
COP21 in Paris was an opportunity for France to call for greater efforts from all countries, to share
concrete solutions to achieve this and highlight the mutual benefits it will bring (sharing lessons
learnt and reducing carbon footprint, among others).
5Many other countries are already actively engaged in the process. The United Kingdom, for
example, has established a carbon plan and chosen to structure its mitigation policy around carbon
budgets. Very early on, Sweden introduced a significant tax reform, increasing taxes on fossil fuels.
More generally, the European Union has set itself the goal of reducing its emissions by 40% by
2030 compared with 1990.
• Reference scenario - broad outline of France’s strategy
Origin of the reference scenario
This scenario models an ambitious implementation of all the measures provided for in the Energy
Transition for Green Growth Act, as well as those that support energy transition. The scale of
ambition of the measures was set to meet the targets contained in the Act. The scenario was
discussed with stakeholders and was assessed from a macroeconomic perspective.
Scope
The scenario illustrates the magnitude of the efforts to be made as well as the expected
transformations and co-benefits. It is not prescriptive, and primarily constitutes a reference for
orientation purposes. In fact, comparative analysis of the measures, both between sectors and
within the same sector, and the consideration of fairness, competitiveness and acceptability, which
would be useful in order to hone and prioritise these measures, should be pursued and increased,
particularly within the context of sectoral or regional planning or programming.
Therefore, the scenario is not an action plan: it rather presents a possible path for achieving our
objectives. It will allow qualitative and quantitative analysis of any discrepancies over time, and
may contribute to identifying corrective measures.
It will also enable short- and medium-term sector-specific recommendations to be made in relation
to this strategy, and is described in section 2.2 of the strategy.
Scenarios studied
6 Cross-cutting recommendations 
• Reducing the carbon footprint by placing it at the heart of decision-making
The reduction in national emissions is a valuable monitoring tool, but is not sufficient to fully
measure France’s contribution to global warming. To take the indirect impacts of France into
account, the strategy promotes more systematic consideration of carbon footprint issues and, more
generally, environmental footprint issues : 
For sectoral policies
• From now on, the financing of public projects should take into account the impact of these
projects in terms of emissions. That entails promoting life cycle analysis (LCA) (notably
within the regulatory framework and as a project selection criterion for public contracting
authorities). This type of analysis is particularly useful for optimising transport infrastructure
and buildings.
For regional policies,  including in particular the “GHG-neutral” region approaches, which
represent an opportunity to mobilise efforts, the recommendation is to :
• promote the consideration of indirect emissions generated by an activity or a region beyond
its energy consumption in greenhouse gas emission assessments (consideration of
“scope 3”). 
Awareness-raising among the public on the impact of consumption choices
• Incentivise simple options to reduce emissions :
◦ favouring durable or repairable products;
◦ triggering a dynamic towards circular economy by focusing on the service rather than on own-
ership: renting, loaning (including through collaborative platforms), carpooling, etc. allow to
meet various needs in a cheaper and less emitting way than by buying; 
◦ reducing food waste and encourage consumption patterns aligned with seasonal productions; 
◦ reducing emissions from building (adoption of good habits in relation to the use of energy-con-
suming devices, development of a public service of energy efficiency, etc.) 
• Implement energy transition by redirecting investment
Awareness-raising among institutional stakeholders, companies and the public on the impact
of their investment choices
The first challenge is to redirect investment towards projects that contribute to energy transition
rather than hindering it : 
7• creation of labels and indicators enabling more comprehensive consideration of the
elements relating to environmental issues, such as the “energy and ecological transition for
the climate” label ;
• improve the operational consideration of “carbon risk”, notably through the implementation
of Article 173 of the Energy Transition Act ;
• provide clarification at a very early stage regarding the reduction path that France intends
to follow, and thereby raise awareness among investors about the fact that certain assets
are susceptible to depreciation, and should not be prioritised in an investment portfolio. It is
a question of continuing to support long-term investment issues (and accordingly, low-car-
bon issues) systematically and  repeatedly ; 
• make tax benefits conditional on making the use of funds raised more environmentally
friendly (e.g. sustainable development savings account).
Strengthen the example set by institutional investors  
• Develop analyses of the carbon footprint and green footprint of assets by institutional
investors such as Bpi France, improve their non-financial reporting by highlighting the
contribution of assets to energy transition and impose a future greening of the investments
offered by the various State-controlled bodies (article 173 of the Energy Transition Act) ;
• Increase the importance of environmental clauses in public tenders. In particular, the
Energy Transition for Green Growth Act laid down targets and means relating to the
example set by public construction and the development of clean vehicle fleets ;
• Have an exemplary policy in development assistance and support for the international
development of French companies (climate section in the project portfolio of the Agence
Française de Développement, review of the criteria for benefitting from export credits, etc.).
Gradually increase the carbon portion of domestic energy consumption taxes without raising
taxes overall
• Gradually increase the carbon portion, based on the fossil carbon content, of domestic
energy consumption taxes, to cut greenhouse gas emissions fourfold. This increase will be
offset by a reduction in taxes on other products, work or income. The objective is to go from
EUR 22/tCO  in 2016 to EUR 56/tCO  in 2020 and EUR 100/tCO  in 2030 (in 2015 EUR).

The supplementary budget for 2015 already includes an increase to EUR 30.5/tC0  in 2017.

• More generally, mobilise price signals (customisation of heating costs, etc.) to encourage
consumers to reduce their use.
• Alongside this, increase efforts to combat fuel poverty. The instruments put in place are
primarily aimed at a structural fall in consumption, while supporting home energy retrofits
and promoting the development of alternative transport in rural areas, such as car pooling.
They are supplemented by the social energy tariffs and energy cheques established by the
Energy Transition Act.
8Maximise the leverage effect of government funding
In particular through the creation and deployment of a guarantee fund for energy transition and the
identification of better means of securing already profitable energy efficiency investments.
• Create conditions for the successful development of a bio-based economy 
The development of the bio-economy (material and energy recovery) using materials such as wood
and non-food agricultural production (straw, hemp, etc.) provides both an opportunity for growth for
our regions, a channel for growth for a wide range of companies (industrial, agricultural, forestry,
construction) and promising solutions that can contribute to reducing the carbon footprint of our
consumption.
The contribution from forestry and agriculture earmarked to supply the materials, energy and
chemical industry must be made in harmony with existing industries (especially for food production,
the primary purpose of agriculture) and balances in production systems must be sought to prevent
conflicts of use. To achieve this :
• efficient supply and processing systems must be fostered, enabling the best possible
mobilisation and use of bio-resources (envisage intercropping and intermediate crops, use
crop residues not required to maintain soil quality, etc.) ;
• furthermore, the sustainability of these sectors must be assessed on a regular basis, in or-
der to ensure high environmental quality for these new sectors and co-benefits for biod-
iversity ;
• innovation in this area will remain a priority for the public authorities.
• Identify opportunities for more sustainable land management
The trend towards soil sealing of agricultural land and the expected development of various
non-food uses of biomass from agriculture and forestry requires special vigilance with regard to the
conflicts of use that the different expectations and issues facing agriculture and forestry generate,
in terms of the production of food, timber, energy and materials, the management of natural
resources, the preservation of biodiversity, and the supply of other environmental amenities. The
disappearance of agricultural and natural land must be halted over time, and heavily reduced by
2035, in line with the recommendations on territorial and urban development. For agricultural land
in decline, it is a question of harnessing innovative recovery techniques enabling sustainable
management and enhancing production potential.
 Promote solutions that fulfil people’s needs while significantly slowing down the artificial de-
velopment of land.
 In regional or development projects: implement measures ensuring that the carbon stock in
soils is not damaged. In particular, investigate how to bring nature into cities (through the
replanting of car parks, for instance) and bring together the residential, employment and
leisure sectors to reduce the land take dedicated to transport infrastructure.
9• Support regional project initiatives and bring together all the energy surrounding
these projects
 Multiply project areas, support project efforts and optimise projects: (development of
“positive energy territories for green growth” (TEPCV), “zero wastage zero waste territories”
(ZGZD) etc.) experiments, and labelling ;
 Involve all regions in territorial climate-air-energy plans (PCAET) at the intermunicipal level,
and facilitate access to the data required to establish regional carbon audits and action
plans (implementation of article 179 of the Energy Transition Act) ;
 Facilitate and support the involvement of education institutions in the implementation of
appropriate actions in regional plans and schemes relating to energy transition for the
green growth of their region (PCAET, regional climate-air-energy scheme (SRCAE) in the
regional planning, sustainable development and equality between territories scheme
(SRADDET), TEPCV, TZGZD, etc.) ; 
 Speed up the transition to sustainable campuses by making higher education institutions
exemplary  with regard to energy performance and, more generally, social responsibility ;
 Encourage the establishment of regional approaches to managing jobs and skills, and 
promote the development of qualifications, particularly in the construction sector.
• Use ambitious R&D and training policies as a basis 
More generally, efforts to provide structure and support to R&D should be continued and expanded
to  encourage the development and rapid dissemination of future technologies, for a
carbon-free world. Training policies and their funding must give high priority to energy transition to
establish excellence pathways in renewable and low-carbon energies as well as in energy
efficiency. As provided for in the Energy Transition Act, multi-annual energy programming (MEP)
will include a component relating to professional transitions. It is vital that France puts itself in a
position to take leadership in these technologies to control consumption and emissions, and
to replace fossil fuels, in order to rapidly gain a foothold in the global market for low-carbon
energy services and equipment. This ambition is in keeping with the ambition defined within the
context of the Energy Union, which aims to make Europe the global leader in the field of renewable
energy.
• Consider the issues involved in the transition to a low-carbon economy in defining
the State’s major strategic directions
This covers the plans and programmes that have an immediate impact on greenhouse gas
emissions, as well as cross-cutting directions, such as the National Energy Research Strategy.
Large parts of the energy transition are dependent on significant research and development efforts.
This is notably the case with the bio-economy, the increased pace of progress relating to energy
efficiency, the major development of renewable energies and the improvement of synergies
between transport methods being sought.
10 Sectoral recommendations 
• Low-carbon transport 
Transport is the sector that emits the most greenhouse gases (27% of GHG emissions in 2013).
Compared with 2013, the target in the reference scenario is to reduce transport emissions by 29%
by the third carbon budget, and by at least 70% by 2050. 
Strategic objectives and immediate actions
To achieve these ambitious targets, the policies put in place must, in particular, make it possible to
speed up :
1. the improvement in vehicle energy efficiency (the goal is an average of 2l/100km for new
light duty vehicles sold in 2030) ;
2. the transition to low-carbon energies. In particular, it is important to anticipate the time
frames for developing refuelling infrastructure (charging points for electric cars and gas
delivery units) required for the transition to low-carbon transport, and coordinate its
deployment by all parties concerned (State, local authorities, public institutions,
businesses, households). 
Other levers must also be mobilised :
3. management of travel demand (through remote working, spatial planning and other
measures) ;
4. improvement in vehicle occupancy rates (car pooling) and more generally, improved use
of existing vehicles and networks (article 44 of the Energy Transition for Green Growth
Act) ;
5. the modal shift of people and goods to non-road and non-air transports (such as rail-
ways, walking and cycling, etc.), which should be favoured in investment in transport
infrastructure and land development choices.
• Low-carbon buildings
In 2013, direct emissions produced by the residential-tertiary sector accounted for 20% of GHG
emissions (nearly one quarter if the indirect emissions associated with electricity and heat
generation for buildings are taken into account). Compared with 2013, the target in the reference
scenario is to reduce these emissions by 54% by the third carbon budget, and by at least 87% by
2050. 
Strategic objectives and immediate actions 
The different action levers should make it possible to reduce energy consumption by 28%
compared with 2010 by 2030, and to further reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with
construction and the long-term use of buildings through : 
 the construction of new buildings with high energy and environmental performance : 
implementation of the 2012 regulations and the future regulation based on a life cycle 
analysis of the environmental impacts of a building will make it possible to significantly 
reduce GHG emissions throughout the lifetime of buildings ;
11 increasing energy retrofit efforts, by both renovating the building envelope and improving
the energy and climate efficiency of systems (e.g. heating, domestic hot water, cooking,
etc.) so as to have a fully renovated set of buildings that comply with “BBC (low-
consumption building) renovation” standards by 2050 ;
 improved management of consumption relating to behaviours and the use of electricity (in
addition to the implementation of European directives (eco-design and labelling)), strength-
ening of consumer information systems, such as communication activities on hidden con-
sumption, the identification of underperforming devices online, the deployment of connec-
ted smart meters, etc.
To achieve this, all the cross-cutting recommendations regarding funding, the development of local
chains, professional training and consideration of the carbon footprint must be implemented. 
• Low-carbon agriculture
Agriculture accounts for around 19% of the greenhouse gas emissions produced by France
recorded in the carbon budgets, to which emissions associated with changes in agricultural land
use are added.
Compared with 2013, the target in the reference scenario is to reduce agricultural emissions by
12% by the third carbon budget, and twofold compared with 1990 by 2050.
The policies set for the agricultural sector should enable it to join the national effort to reduce
GHGs, while retaining its competitiveness and offering green growth and job creation opportunities,
since they make it possible to : 
• guarantee food security and support the bio-economy while ensuring the supply of
non-food products ;
• protect the environment and natural resources (water, biodiversity, soils, air, etc.), protect
public health, protect the countryside and social dynamics.
Five factors play an important role in achieving the targets :
• cultivation and livestock rearing systems and practices, which, for the same output of
agricultural produce, can emit more or fewer GHGs ;
• rural land planning and land use ;
• the efficiency of the entire food supply chain up to the end consumer, which enables waste
and indirect emissions to be reduced ;
• food demand (composition of diets, quantities, product origin, etc.), which influences the
composition of agricultural production ;
• techniques for adapting to climate change, which enable production systems to be main-
tained or improved.
The main targets involve reducing the direct emissions of the agricultural sector (N2O, CH4), stor-
ing or keeping carbon in soils and biomass, and using biomass over fossil fuels (for the production
of bio-based materials or energy).
12Strengthened implementation of the agro-ecological project 
Achieving these targets requires strengthened implementation of the agro-ecological project,
and in particular :
• optimisation of the use of inputs (fertiliser, animal feed, etc.) and efforts toward achieving
autonomy with local resources (replacement of mineral fertiliser by organic fertiliser, protein
autonomy and the optimisation of animal rations, etc.) ;
• the diversification of crop rotation and the development of leguminous plants ;
• the conservation of permanent grassland and the development of agroforestry, hedges and
other agro-ecological infrastructure ;
• land cover and an increase in the amount of organic matter in the soil ;
• the development of high added-value production ;
• the energy performance of agricultural buildings and equipment and significant development of
agricultural methanisation.
• Forest-Timber-Biomass
Today, four levers make it possible to offset around 15 to 20% of national emissions :
1. the replacement of energy-intensive materials with bio-based products ;
2. energy recovery in relation to bio-based products or waste from these products, to replace
fossil fuels ;
3. carbon storage in wood and wood-based products ;
4. carbon sequestration in the forest ecosystem.
It is a question of promoting multifunctional forestry, and in particular, increasing the added
value of uses while increasing the amount of timber collected per year and making areas of
agricultural decline the subject of sustainable management efforts. Synergies and uses should also
be boosted in connection with the development of co-products and waste from bio-based sectors,
their recycling and their use for energy generation purposes. More broadly, the management of all
biomass uses must be strengthened and optimised. High environmental quality should be aimed
for in all projects designed to improve resource mobilisation, taking particular account of
biodiversity issues. 
The implementation of these objectives is dependent on :
 the consolidation of small forest estates, or at least their management, ensuring they are
renewed regularly (redevelopment  of wasteland, conversion of coppices, including
impoverished coppices, with the modification of species where necessary, etc.) ;
 a tax framework promoting the dynamic and sustainable management of resources ;
 the efficient use of bio-based resources in all economic sectors (industry, construction,
furnishing, packaging, energy systems, etc.) ;
 close monitoring of sustainability and in particular, impacts on soils and biodiversity ;
 reinforced and shared monitoring of movements of materials and economic data.
13• Low-carbon industry
The emissions produced by industry account for 18% of GHG emissions in France. They have
fallen by 27% since 1990 (see section 1.1 for the reasons for this). 75% of these emissions are
subject to the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).
Compared with 2013, the target in the reference scenario is to reduce industry emissions by 24%
by the third carbon budget, and by 75% by 2050.
By 2050, the transition to a low-carbon economy will be achieved through : 
 Improving energy efficiency to manage demand for energy and materials by product ;
 Recycling, reuse, the replacement of carbon-intensive materials with less carbon-intensive
ones, such as bio-based materials, and energy recovery to reduce consumption of energy
and materials ;
 Energy substitution in order to reduce the share of energies with high emission levels in
industrial consumption and materials.
In the longer term, the development and deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) will play
a significant role in achieving targets.
Concerning implementation issues, it is useful to signal : 
 the studies published by the French Environment and Energy Management Agency,
ADEME, which highlight a significant techno-economic pool that is not exploited due to a
lack of financing capacities (companies primarily dedicate their investment capacities to
developing their production process rather than energy savings), which could be exploited
as soon as innovative funding schemes can be implemented ;
 the need to make the carbon price signals visible and predictable, in order to limit lock-in
effects (investment decisions that are not consistent with the necessary medium-term
changes) ;
 the need to prevent emission reduction tools from leading to deindustrialisation.
• Low-carbon energies
Emissions caused by energy generation account for just 12% of GHG emissions in France, and
85% of these emissions fall under the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). They fell by 27%
between 1990 and 2013.
Strategic objectives and immediate actions
By 2050, the work of the 2020-2050 trajectory committee towards a low-carbon economy assumes
a reduction by a factor of 20 compared to 1990, i.e. almost complete decarbonisation of the sector.
This translates into : 
• an acceleration in energy efficiency gains (by a factor of two in the Energy Transition for
Green Growth Act): a fall in the energy intensity of GDP and the importance of managing
carbon energy consumption, transfers of use to electricity. 
14• a drastic decarbonisation of the energy mix by 2050 (by a factor of 10) : (fall in
gCO /kWh of electricity and heating networks). The ambition that lies behind these
2
scenarios is based on the assumption of a significant deployment of carbon capture and
storage (CCS) systems by 2050. If this is not the case, then the efforts to decarbonise
energy generation must be transferred to other options, including other sectors of the
economy. 
In the power generation sector, it is primarily a question of :
 Avoiding investing in new fossil fuel thermal production facilities as much as possible. The
multiannual energy programmes should precisely control the need for new thermal
production facilities according to the policies set for other sectors, the objectives of security
of energy supply and the need for flexibility in the electricity system, while adhering to the
carbon budgets and decarbonisation targets of the electricity system over the long term.
 Reducing the emissions produced by existing facilities by making the carbon price high
enough. 
 Providing for the possibility of deploying carbon capture and storage systems or using
carbon for fossil fuel plants which will be in operation by 2050 (by retrofitting where
necessary), taking account of the storage options available when choosing where to locate
facilities.
 Improving the flexibility of the system without increasing emissions: the integration of
renewable energies will eventually require increased flexibility. This notably requires the
development of : 
◦ The flexibility of the hydroelectric sector, since this renewable energy sector enables
significant peak production ;
◦ Smart networks and storage tailored to needs: weekly storage to deal with the
intermittent nature of wind power by 2030, and daily storage to manage photovoltaic
generation after 2030, once it reaches significant levels ; 
◦ Transfers between energy systems (power-to-gas, power-to-heat) ;
◦ Connections with neighbouring countries to maximise the proliferation of renewable 
energy generation.
In the heat generation sector, it is primarily a question of orienting generation towards renewable
heat sources and heat recovery, and developing urban heating networks, to enable increased use
of renewable energy and recovery through heating systems.
15• Make waste treatment one of the pillars for developing a more circular economy
The waste treatment sector accounted for 4% of French GHG emissions in 2013. Compared with
2013, the target in the reference scenario is to reduce transport emissions by -33% by the third
carbon budget, and by at least 80% by 2050.
The actions levers in order of long-term priority are as follows :
1. Avoid waste production through prevention (eco-design, increasing the lifetime of
products, repair, limiting food waste) and reuse (circular economy) ;
2. Increase the material recovery of waste which cannot be avoided (recycling, widespread
use of source separation of bio-waste by 2025) ;
3. Recover the energy from unavoidable and non-recoverable waste in material form ;
4. Reduce diffuse methane emissions from landfill sites and sewage treatment plants,
including the non-recoverable part in particular ;
5. Cease incineration without energy recovery.
These five action levers must be implemented collectively. In addition to the fall in direct emis-
sions, they will enable a reduction in emissions in the production and consumption sectors.
The transition to a more circular economic model is at play in the broad sense that it constitutes a
paradigm shift in our production and consumption model (material, resource and energy savings;
sustaining value, wealth and jobs).These levers must supplement efforts to engage in the short
term to ensure the collection and recovery (or flaring) of emissions produced by waste storage
 facilities and the energy and climate optimisation of sewage treatment plants, when making
structural investments in them, in order to achieve much more systematic collection and recovery
of the biogas and residual heat produced. 
16 Carbon budgets      
• Definition of carbon budgets  
To achieve its long-term targets, France has adopted ‘carbon budgets’ at the national level, which
are broken down into the major activity sectors for information purposes. These are caps on
greenhouse gas emissions established to systematically ensure over ten years’ visibility with
regard to progress in reducing emissions. They cover five-year periods (four years for the first
budget) so that analysis of compliance or non-compliance with them cannot be overly influenced
by situational phenomena (a particularly mild or harsh winter, upwards or downwards fluctuations
in the price of fossil fuels, etc.). 
• Application 
Carbon budgets are tools for monitoring progress in reducing emissions. They should make it pos-
sible to measure progress and check/identify whether France is on the right track towards achiev-
ing its targets. In particular, the indicative breakdown by activity sector (resulting from the forward
studies set out in the following section) should not be regarded as a rigid compartmentalisation of
targets, but as a primary sectoral breakdown to guide overall management. Therefore, this break-
down is an integral component of the set of indicators for this strategy, providing indications about
the risk of deviating from the global target and any need for corrective measures, without anticipat-
ing the sector in which these additional reductions must take place (see part 4 of the strategy).

the second and third budgets insofar as the exact shape depends on directives and regulations
that will be implemented to apply the decision made by the European Council in October 2014,
when a target of a 40% reduction in European emissions was agreed.

Consistency: Before each update of the strategy, the expert committee must analyse the
consistency of the measures implemented with the paths enabling compliance with the carbon
budgets previously set (for example, at the end of 2018, the expert committee must deliver an
opinion on the consistency of the measures implemented with the carbon budgets for 2015-2018,
2019-2023 and 2024-2028).

OREWORD
France has set itself ambitious climate and energy targets, within the framework of the
commitments made by the European Union.
Above and beyond these objectives, France is committed to a genuine process of energy transition
in order to overhaul our entire energy model and fight back against climate change.
Furthermore, this transition is an opportunity for us to nurture the development of a new, more
stable form of growth capable of generating better jobs and improving our quality of life: the green
economy.
The transition is taking place in our local territories through the initiatives they are leading. The
transition will be driven by their commitment to making this new development model a success,
bolstered by the capacity of our local authorities to make change happen at ground level.
It is an opportunity for innovation and entrepreneurship, with the industrial and service sectors
playing a key role. The transition is the sum of countless concrete, ambitious projects.
It is enshrined in the Energy Transition and Green Growth Act, which shows the way forward and
provides our regions and local authorities with the institutional resources they need to launch and
nurture green energy projects.
With this new low-carbon strategy, the energy transition gains a broad, unifying steering and
coordinating tool which will guarantee the coherency of our efforts.
Set down in law, this strategy will be implemented under the six-party governance system (national
government, regional authorities, Parliament, businesses, unions, NGOs affiliated to the National
Council for the Ecological Transition). It is a key plank in our national ecological transition, covering
the crucial priorities of energy transition and green growth.

NTRODUCTION SCOPE OF THE LOW CARBON
STRATEGY
One of the two key pillars of our climate policy
The National Low-Carbon Strategy (French: SNBC) sets out our climate change mitigation policy o,
i.e. reducing greenhouse gas emissions and boosting efforts to trap these gases in "carbon sinks."
It is, of course, closely linked to our policy on adapting to climate change, helping man-made and
natural systems to adjust to the environmental changes brought on by climate transformation.
These changes are now inevitable, and our mitigation policy is aimed at limiting global warming to
2°C, or below 1°C if possible. Both policies focus on reducing the impact of greenhouse gases.
This process of adaptation is covered by its own specific strategy: the National Strategy for
Adapting to Climate Change. Coordination between these two policies will focus on seizing
opportunities for synergy and resolving any conflicts between the measures put in place. Close
cooperation will be particularly important in sectors which are heavily dependent on natural
resources, especially agriculture and forestry.
Furthermore, the SNBC is in total harmony with the National Strategy for the Ecological Transition
to Sustainable Development (SNTEDD), particularly with reference to Priorities 2 (a circular, low-
carbon economy) and 1 (developing sustainable, resilient territories), acting on several fronts to
support and accelerate social change (Priorities 4, 5 and 6) and incorporating education and
governance tools in order to encourage widespread engagement with the transition (Priorities 7, 8
and 9). It is entirely consistent with the targets set for restoring biodiversity (Priority 1) in the
corresponding national strategy, as well as the national health priority of combating atmospheric
pollution and abiding by EU and WHO standards. These areas of overlap are dealt with in greater
detail in the accompanying report: § 5.2.iii
Directly binding for the public sector only
The national low-carbon strategy (SNBC) sets out a roadmap for our policy of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, in a manner which is economically sustainable in the medium-to-long
term.
Designed to "steer policy," this strategy is aimed primarily at public-sector decision-makers,
particularly at national, regional and inter-municipal levels, including public institutions. For this
priority target group, the SNBC and its carbon budgets are legally binding and must be respected.
Applicable to all 
Strictly speaking, this strategy is only legally binding for the public sector - but all businesses and
all citizens are indirectly concerned. They will feel its concrete effects via the many and varied
public-sector decisions made in light of this strategy (regulations, financial support, economic
policy, education and training etc.).
For businesses and households, the SNBC will serve as a reference document on the
government's strategy in this area, providing useful information which may help guide investment
decisions.
Obligation to take the SNBC into account
More precisely, the SNBC will be enforced (in the public sector) by an obligation to take its
provisions into consideration - with the exception of the energy sector, where the obligation is one
5of compatibility.
In positive law, the obligation to take something into consideration requires those concerned "not to
deviate from these fundamental principles except, subject to approval by the courts, for reasons
derived from the best interests of the operation and justified by these interests." (cf. Council of
State 9 June 2004, 28 July 2004, 17 March 2010). The principal consequence of this requirement
is that the SNBC cannot be ignored and any deviations (points on which strategy documents are
not compatible with the SNBC) must be explained and justified.
As regards energy policy, the law introduces Multiannual Energy Plans (MEPs) which incorporate a
compatibility component, making them more restrictive than the obligation to take the SNBC into
account. The MEPs nonetheless leave a certain amount of room for manoeuvre in the
interpretation of the SNBC, all while ensuring that it is not possible to take measures which directly
contradict its central principles and provisions.
To make them easier to understand and apply, these principles and provisions are limited in
number and grouped into a series of bullet points in Chapter 3 (particularly Section 3.3 in Part 2).
They are also summarised in the recap of points to be monitored in Chapter 4.2. They focus
particularly on implementing carbon budgets, and as such it is partly through these provisions that
carbon budgets are binding.
The scope of this obligation in the public sector
This obligation is of great significance for planning and scheduling documents, which have a major
impact on greenhouse gas emissions. This is of particular importance in the sectors listed in
Chapter 3 (transport, construction and the tertiary sector, industry, energy, agriculture, forestry,
waste   management),   as   well   as   for   territorial   planning   operations   (especially   Regional
Development, Sustainable Development and Territorial Equality Schemes, as well as Regional
Economic Development, Innovation and Internationalisation Schemes).
It also applies to financial support for public projects. Such decisions must now systematically take
into consideration, among other factors, a project's impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.
The principles and calculation methods used for these assessments will be defined in the decree
stipulated in Article L.222-1 B of the French Environment Code.
An iterative review process
The low-carbon strategy will be subjected to a comprehensive review cycle every five years. At this
point, the perimeter covered by the next two budget cycles may be adjusted if necessary
(particularly in light of France's commitments at European level regarding net carbon emissions
connected to land usage and related changes). This process includes:
◦ the opinion from the committee of experts (Article L. 145-1 of the Energy Code)
regarding the success of the carbon budgets already in place (the balance of the one
now reaching its conclusion, projections for the next two budgets) and how to
implement the current low-carbon strategy. These findings will be passed on to the
standing committees of the National Assembly and the Senate responsible for energy
and the environment.
◦ a government report covering the review of the low-carbon strategy, a draft for the
forthcoming third carbon budget and any adjustments made to the first and second
budget cycles. This report will clearly demonstrate how the draft carbon budget and the
low-carbon strategy incorporate the objectives set out in Article L. 100-4 of the Energy
Code, as well as France's European and international commitments. The report will
assess the environmental, social and economic impact of the carbon budget for the
coming periods and of the new low-carbon strategy, particularly with regard to the
6competitiveness  of  economic activities  subject   to international  competition,  the
development of new, local activities, and overall growth. This report will be made public.
◦ the opinion of the National Committee for the Ecological Transition and its committee of
experts.
◦ a decree setting out the low-carbon strategy and corresponding carbon budgets.
◦ these decisions will be presented in Parliament, along with a quantitative summary of
the most recent carbon budget and an analysis of the results achieved in this cycle.
Exceptionally, the first cycle will last for four years, while subsequent cycles will then last five years.
The results of the first review process should be published by decree no later than 1st July 2019.
This will ensure that the review (and all subsequent reviews) are conducted relatively early on in
the parliamentary term.
Regular reporting
Every two years, a report to the European Commission will provide details of measures taken to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, assessing their effectiveness and identifying medium-term
prospects for further reducing emissions, including a scenario which takes account of those
measures already put in place.  This report will be made public.
Every year, reports will be submitted to Parliament covering:
• government spending on climate policy;
• financial backing for the energy transition, quantifying and analysing the public funding
and evaluating the private funding allocated to the energy transition, with reference to the
levels of funding required to meet the targets and rate of transition prescribed by the law.
This report will focus particularly on actions to control energy demand and measures to
promote renewable energies, as well as the impact of energy consumption on trends in
greenhouse gas emissions and, more generally, on the environment.  
The report will be presented to the National Council for the Ecological Transition and the
Economic, Social and Environmental Council.
Ongoing monitoring
Via these reports, and within the monitoring framework put in place for the sector-specific policies,
the indicators detailed in this strategy document will be analysed and updated regularly. This
strategy thus guarantees the coherency of our climate policy on all fronts. It will enable us to hit our
stated objectives, providing the necessary resources and facilitating the necessary adjustments in
sectoral and territorial policies, wherever discrepancies with the reference scenario are identified.
This will be particularly useful in allowing us to gradually optimise the distribution of mitigation
efforts across different sectors (Part 3.3) and territories (Part 3.2.viii) in successive phases. This
distribution will depend on the initiatives and commitments of the various parties, as well as the
effective implementation of measures and their observed efficacy, not to mention the new
opportunities regularly opened up by progress in research and innovation.

HAPTER HERE ARE WE COMING FROM HOW FAR
    ?
CAN WE GO
1.1. The story so far
A. Development of emissions in France since 1990
France now has one of the lowest rates of per capita emissions among the world's developed
nations. Per capita emissions are higher in 90% of developed nations (taken together, these
nations account for almost half of the world's total population). This gives some idea of the scale of
decarbonisation efforts already undertaken in France, efforts which will be stepped up between
now and 2030, and 2050.
Following the first oil crisis (1973), France realised the importance of moderating the growth of
energy consumption and limiting the country's dependency on imported oil. France's National
Energy Saving Agency was founded in 1974. Households and businesses were encouraged to
minimise unnecessary energy consumption, with a clear impact on the structure of national
consumption: final energy consumption intensity declined from Base 100 in 1970 to 52 in 2013.
In the meantime, a large-scale nuclear programme has seen the country's energy supply mix shift
from 85% coal and oil to a situation in which these thermal energy sources represent just 10% of
total energy production.
These major changes were set in motion in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but the pace of change
slowed when oil prices fell (the 1980s oil glut). Energy efficiency once again became a priority in
the late 1990s (with the Commission for the National Plan's report on energy consumption,
published in 1998), leading to the introduction of climate policies which have been extended and
developed in subsequent climate strategies.
Figure 1.1 : GHG emissions by unit of GDP (PPP). Sources : emissions, excluding LULUCF 
(UNFCCC – except India and China WRI/CAIT) and GDP (World Bank)
8All of which has left France with:
• an economy which is among the least carbon-dependent of the developed nations
• "easy" energy efficiency opportunities already exploited
• more-or-less short-term public policies in all sectors of activity, coordinated by national
strategies with clear monitoring indicators,
• experience in the impact of energy prices, and the importance of a more structured, pro-
active and sustained policy of reducing emissions,
• development of renewable energies
• growing public awareness.
Greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 10.8% between 1990 and 2013 (cf. figure 1.2 below)
(CITEPA/MEDDE/ December 2015 version, Kyoto criteria). In France, in 2013: 74% of these
emissions were CO2, 12% CH4, 9% N2O and 5% fluorinated gases.
Figure 1.2 : inventories of greenhouse gases of France
Some sectors of activity are liable to see substantial variations from one year to the next. This
includes the residential and tertiary sectors, as well as industry. Other sectors, meanwhile, are
fairly stable: transport and agriculture. Significant annual fluctuations indicate that a sector is
heavily influenced by factors which are liable to change rapidly: for example, the close correlation
between residential / tertiary emissions and winter temperatures, or the fact that industrial
emissions are greatly affected by the introduction of new production technologies or emission
treatment systems, not to mention the economic climate. Transport emissions, on the other hand,
are linked to the long-term evolution of lifestyles. They occasionally reflect the impact of sudden
price increases (e.g. 2009), but in the medium-term they reveal the influence of policies to take
9older vehicles off the road and incentives to use public transport. The impact of these actions can
be seen over the long term.
In order to achieve a more detailed analysis of the relationship between France's greenhouse gas
emissions and certain factors both endogenous and exogenous to the calculation of these
emissions, a study was commissioned from the CITEPA/CEREN consortium in 2015. The principal
findings of this study are given here in appendix.
B. Emissions linked to consumption in France
Greenhouse gases at international level are measured using a territorial approach, but other
approaches have been developed which allow us to factor in the impact of emissions generated
outside the national territory to meet the consumption of good within it. This is the case with the
'carbon footprint' approach. These two approaches complement one another when it comes to
analysing and developing climate policy. Carbon footprint is presented as a cross-disciplinary
approach in Paragraph 3.2.i.
101.2.   Perspectives   -   lessons   to   be   learned   from   previous
experience
1. Aspects of structural significance
Many prospective reflection taking into account the need to drastically reduce greenhouse gases
emissions have been conducted since the beginning of the years 2000 (see among other the first
four references in the bibliography at the end of this document).
More recently, the future of energy and climate policy was thoroughly debated within the framework
of and in parallel with the National Debate on the Energy Transition (DNTE), which ran from
November 2012 to July 2013. Having examined a broad selection of pre-existing scenarios (16 in
total), the group of experts selected for the DNTE decided that the major strategic decisions
required in the coming years could be illustrated in the form of four 'DNTE Trajectories'. These
trajectories represent two contrasting levels of energy demand, and two contrasting modes of
energy production which could be used to satisfy this demand (the 'energy mix').
In all of these cases, the 'price signal' sent by the value of carbon, and the way it is received by the
underlying economy, appeared to have a decisive impact on results, although more detailed
analysis is required. This price signal can be taken literally - as a result of fiscal measures, for
example - but it can also be used in the models to express the effects of other changes of
equivalent significance induced by a raft of measures which are not individually specified and
which may not necessarily be fiscal in nature, instead taking the form of regulations or standards.
To be more precise, certain studies describe an array of measures and behavioural changes,
illustrating the potential importance of changes in behaviour. In other scenarios, less restrictive in
terms of the options selected, the search for opportunities to reduce emissions is driven by the
reaction to a 'carbon price signal'. Finally, it should be noted that some of these scenarios rely
heavily on technical developments, while others afford greater priority to changes in lifestyle.

Energy Transition

Final energy consumption in the four 'DNTE trajectories'
Figure 1.4 : final energy consumption in the four types of trajectories analysed during France National
Debate on the Energy Transition (source: DNTE Working Group 2 'Scenarios and the Energy Mix', July
2013)
Studies focusing on all forms of greenhouse gas emissions (the 2020–2050 Trajectories
Committee: towards a low-carbon economy (2012), ADEME Vision for 2030 and 2050, Negawatt
etc.) provide a preliminary overview of the reduction in emissions which can be envisaged in
different sectors of activity: achieving our target of cutting all greenhouse gas emissions to a
quarter of their 1990 levels by 2050 ('Factor 4') may require an even more substantial reduction in
emissions from energy consumption (slashed to 20% of 1990 levels), with a drastic reduction in
industrial emissions from centralised energy production (down to 10%) and a less significant
reduction in emissions from other sectors such as agriculture (which will nonetheless require
significant effort in order to cut emissions in half).
2. 'Citizens' Reading Guide'
One of the problems with this scenario-based approach is that it is often hard to understand for
members of the general public who are neither energy experts nor overly familiar with technical
economic modelling practices. The DNTE's ' Scenarios and the Energy Mix ' Working Group has
adopted an original approach to helping citizens understand these scenarios, proposing a list of
criteria which can be used to establish a hierarchy of preferences. With this goal in mind, the DNTE
group of experts were asked to translate these "citizens' criteria" into a form which the scenario
builders could use in their representations, offering concrete responses. This is a slightly amended
version of the resulting list of criteria:
• Economic and macro-economic impact
̄ Energy cost and prices, savings and costs of energy services
̄ Investments (by sector and segment, nature and timeframe)
1 Some of these scenarios do not stretch as far as 2050, or do not consider all forms of greenhouse gases. They are not
all constructed with reference to the 'Factor 4' target for all greenhouse gases. Nevertheless, this model of four broad
trajectories remains a useful way of illustrating the different potential paths towards a major reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions.
12̄ Jobs, professional sectors, career paths
• Environmental impact
̄ Management and conservation of resources (including biomass and land)
̄ Impact on biodiversity and other environmental impacts
̄ Reduction of greenhouse gases
̄ Respecting national and international commitments for the environment, locally and
globally
• Social impact
̄ Social cohesion and justice
̄ Lifestyles
̄ Territorial autonomy and governance of local systems
• Other impacts
̄ Impact on health, risk of accidents, safety
̄ Resilience and robustness, reversibility and flexibility of the energy system
̄ Energy security
• Feasibility of this scenario: macro-economic, sociological and technological considerations
3. Follow-up actions
The DNTE work on the four 'DNTE Trajectories' did not yield a definitive analysis, but an analysis is
outlined in Part 2 of this strategy, based on the scenarios which underpin the carbon budgets. This
analysis will help us to identify key indicators, facilitating factors and obstacles (technological 'lock-
ins' and problems relating to the public perception of actions, for example). This analysis will
facilitate subsequent analyses of the gaps between forecasts and actual results for different
variables (emissions, consumption etc.).
Finally, a study focusing on the four DNTE trajectories was conducted after the debate. On the one
hand, this study highlighted the need for regular 'loopbacks' between exogenous variables and
results, in order to ensure overall consistency. On the other hand, it recommends using the DNTE
scenarios to define a set of monitoring indicators which can be used to keep track of the energy
transition. Policies and measures can then be defined, monitored and piloted with reference to
these indicators.
13C  2: T  F  
HAPTER HE RENCH PROJECT
2.1. Major decisions taken
The way forward is clearly signposted by the Energy Transition and Green Growth Act and the
commitments which France has already made for the period to 2020:
• -14% of emissions (exc. ETS) by 2020, compared with 2005 levels
• -40% reduction on 1990 levels by 2030 (this relative target, identical to the average
European target, demonstrates France's commitment to remaining one of the European
nations with the lowest per capita greenhouse gas emissions over this period)
• -75% reduction on 1990 levels by 2050 (Factor 4)
It is therefore fully consistent with the policy in place at EU level.
Our first priority is to develop a new mode of green, sustainable growth. Above and beyond
France's international objectives and carbon budgets, public policy must also aim to achieve a
reduction in the global carbon footprint.
The law also introduces the pragmatic principle of regular reviews, including a five-year iterative
cycle for assessing and revising the carbon budgets and this strategy.
This is a thoroughly balanced approach, combining:
Ambition and realism
Cutting greenhouse gas emissions to 140Mt in the space of one or two generations represents a
real challenge. It will require average reductions of between 9 and 10 Mt of CO  per year until
2
2050. This means increasing the pace of reduction compared with the period 2005-2013, without
sacrificing the economic development of our country and without exporting our emissions by
relocating those activities with the highest emissions overseas.
Figure 2.1 : inventories of greenhouse gases emissions (1990-2013), preliminary estimate of 2014 emissions
in mainland France and the overseas departments and France emissions reduction targets for the 2030 and
2050 time horizons. Source : CITEPA and MEDDE/DGEC
A broad array of economic sectors are likely to be affected. Massive investment is required and an
overhaul in production and consumption patterns is essential. It is therefore crucial that we quantify
the stakes at hand, at both the macro-economic (national) and micro-economic (as experienced by
businesses and households) levels, extending this exercise in the form of comprehensive
14economic monitoring.
The various forward studies which have already been conducted demonstrate that this is possible.
While this strategy outlines the general framework, close analysis of the scenarios reveals a large
spectrum of possibilities. Many consultations will be required across all sectors in order to
determine the best way to proceed, especially as there should be no shortage of new opportunities
as technology and its costs evolve.   
International Justice
With this ambitious strategy, France is assuming its responsibilities in the fight against climate
change and calling upon other governments to do the same, in keeping with the principle that
action should be proportionate to our shared responsibilities, but that individual countries should
take on different burdens - taking their historical responsibility into account, among other things - in
light of their relative capacity for action, including economic capabilities.
According to the report published in November 2014 by the United Nations Environment
Programme on the gap between requirements and capacities in terms of emissions reduction (the
UNEP Emissions Gap Report), if the targets set by all countries for the coming decades allow us to
attain a broadly similar level of emissions per capita all over the world by 2030 or 2050, we should
be somewhere in the median range of the scenarios compatible with a 2°C global warming target.
The steering measures for this strategy also underline the importance of taking social impact and
redistribution into account, as explained in further detail in Part 5.2.ii).
Diverse technological options
The objective is to lay the foundations for the green economy, based on the four main pillars
identified by the World Bank: energy sobriety in all sectors; the use of decarbonised energy for
transport, heating and industry; reinforcing natural carbon sinks and bio-based production;
decarbonisation of the electricity generation mix.
For example, in the field of renewable energies, no technological option is to be discarded.
Encouraging widespread use of the most mature technologies will allow us to transform the energy
mix at a lower cost, while continuing to develop technologies which are not yet mature will help us
to prepare for the future and establish a strong foothold in these promising markets. This robust
approach will help us to adapt to the unforeseen obstacles which will inevitably crop up along the
way, and make the most of all the natural resources available to us, including those in our
overseas territories (solar power, wind, biomass, geothermal, various forms of marine energy etc.).
15Creating wealth and sustainable jobs
The aim of this transition is not simply to reduce our carbon footprint while capitalising on the
accompanying benefits for our economy and environment, but also and above all to transform the
process of adapting to carbon constraints into a source of inspiration and dynamism for a new
approach to growth: fairer; more sustainable; creating more jobs which are better qualified, more
evenly spread across all territories and not liable to be outsourced abroad; in short, more in
keeping with the expectations of our fellow citizens.
The development of a low-carbon economy will allow France to:
• become less dependent on imported fossil fuels, reducing our energy bill and carbon
footprint
• bolster growth and achieve GDP growth which outstrips the projections based on current
trends for the next two decades
• boost employment (between 100,000 and 350,000 new jobs created between 2015 and
2035)
In practice, this means that while the current strategy covers all means at the government's
disposal in the fight against climate change - State-controlled factors such as standards,
regulations and fiscal pressure - we must never forget that one of our top priorities is to expand the
capacity for action of those on the front line: businesses, families, local authorities etc. We must
endow these civil society partners with the means to develop and expand the countless initiatives
already in place.
162.2. The reference scenario
Establishing the reference scenario
This scenario, which is compatible with the targets set down in law, is very directly inspired by the
modelling work detailed in the next section, focusing on carbon budgets. These models integrate
various sector-specific factors, based on a combination of measures designed to respond to
France's greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for the 2030 and 2050 deadlines.
This scenario was developed under the aegis of a steering committee, made up of experts from the
relevant   ministries   and   industrial   sectors.   The   steering   committee   was   co-chaired   by
representatives of the Ministry for the Environment (Energy and Climate Division and the General
Commission for Sustainable Development - CGDD) and the Agency for the Environment and
Energy Efficiency (ADEME). The group's secretariat was composed of representatives of the
Department for the Fight against the Greenhouse Effect, part of the Energy and Climate Division.
This steering committee was cross-disciplinary in nature, incorporating sector-specific sub-
committees (energy, transport, construction, industry, waste management, agriculture, forestry)
when necessary. Throughout the working process - i.e. from the definition of the fundamental
hypotheses up until presentation of the final results - the Information and Orientation Committee
(CIO) met six times, inviting input from civil society figures regarding modelling decisions and
discussing the results obtained. All organisations represented on the National Council for the
Ecological Transition (which brings together representatives of employees, employers and
consumers, environmental NGOs, territorial authorities and members of parliament) were invited to
take part in these CIO meetings.
The reference scenario was constructed in successive phases, starting by drawing up a list of
policies and measures already in place as of 1st January 2014, then adding those measures
included in the draft bill on Energy Transition and Green Growth which could be easily modelled,
and any additional initiatives or changes contributing to the attainment of the measures set down in
law. Moreover, a series of sensitivity tests allowed the committee to measure uncertainty
surrounding the impact of certain factors and determine the level of mobilisation required by
different scenarios, based on discussions in the information and orientation committee meetings.
Details of the main options selected are presented hereunder.
Scope of the reference scenario: illustrating the major strategic decisions taken
This scenario demonstrates the scale of the efforts which will be required, as well as the
transformations and benefits they will yield. It is not prescriptive, and primarily constitutes a
reference for orientation purposes
In fact, comparative analysis of the measures, both between sectors and within the same
sector, and the consideration of fairness, competitiveness and acceptability, which would be
useful in order to hone and prioritise these measures, should be pursued and increased,
particularly within the context of sectoral or regional planning or programming. The sector-
specific figures and measures presented hereunder are intended to be modified and
developed in greater detail as required, within the context of these sectoral and regional
policies and with respect for the general strategy embodied in our carbon budgets and long-
term orientations.
As such, the scenario is not an action plan.
17It provides a cross-disciplinary, concrete and necessarily simplified overview, without
claiming to offer a detailed diagnosis of the best possible route to attaining the specific
objectives of each sector.
Nonetheless, in addition to its general purpose as an indication of things to come, this
scenario has been used to create sector-specific indicators which will facilitate individual
monitoring of the various components which combine to make up overall CO2 emissions.
These indicators concern all of the sectors covered here, and they should be tracked and
taken into account from the very start of the period covered by the carbon budget. They are
explained in detail in the various chapters of Part 3, and summarised in the Conclusion (Part
4).
This prospective scenario was used in the definition of the carbon budgets (cf. 2.3 Carbon
Budgets), which are implemented by decree.
The scenario has also been used to assess the macro-economic impact of the strategy.
Description of the reference scenario
This section sets out the major orientations and measures used to calculate the reference
scenario, on which the carbon budgets and some of the sectoral strategy recommendations are
based.
Macro-economic context:
According to the European Commission's recommendations, the macro-economic outlook for
France is as follows:
• Over the period 2016-2020, GDP should grow by an average of 1.6% per annum, followed
by 1.9% for the period 2021-2025, 1.7% for 2026-2030 and 1.6% for 2031-2035.
• Industrial value added should increase by an average of 1.6% per annum between 2016
and 2020, followed by 2.0% for the period 2021-2025, 1.5% for 2026-2030 and 1.3% for
2031-2035.
• The population is expected to grow to reach 72 million by 2035.
• International fossil fuel prices are expected to see average annual increases of 1.9% for oil,
1.8% for coal and 2.2% for gas over the period 2010-2035 (Data: WEO (2012) 'New Policy
Scenario).
In the transport sector:
Factors coming into play in the medium term (2030-2035):
• more efficient vehicles on the roads (cars + light commercial vehicles + HGVs). For cars
and light commercial vehicles, the average fuel consumption of new vehicles in 2030 is
expected to be 2l/100km.
• the development of hybrid rechargeable vehicles (c. 2.5 million by 2030), electric cars (1.9
million by 2030) and gas-powered vehicles (the latter are expected to account for 5% of
light commercial vehicles by 2030, as well as 2.5% of HGVs and 1% of cars).
• measures to modernise the transportation of goods: modal transition (20% of freight
transportation should be off-road by 2030) and greater optimisation efforts (average load
18increased from 7.5 tonnes to 8.7 tonnes by 2035, an improvement of 16%) via voluntary
schemes as well as action plans required of haulage companies under Art. 12 of the
PLTECV.
• use of public transport for short journeys in on the increase, thanks in large part to new
investments in infrastructure (almost 2,000km of new tram lines and rapid-transit bus lanes)
in the regions, and the Greater Paris project for the capital. Alternative scenarios have been
modelled in order to document the impact of varying levels of investment in transport
infrastructures.
• new habits which will drive down energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from
the transport sector: 10% of working days conducted 'at home' by 2030. An increase in car-
sharing, boosted considerably by company travel schemes, allowing for an increase in the
average number of persons per car (increasing the average from 1.8 to 2 per vehicle by
2030). The proportion of short journeys made on foot or by bicycle was 2.7% in 2008, and
should rise to 12.5% by 2030. Environmentally-responsible driving habits also help to
reduce consumption and emissions.
• reducing speed limits on interurban networks will allow us to cut total energy consumption
in the transport sector by 3%.
In the long term (by 2050), while public transport as a proportion of overall transportation should
be greatly expanded, particularly for freight, France's roads will nonetheless remain by far the most
popular transport option. However, the vehicles we drive should undergo a radical transformation,
with a majority of light vehicles consuming under 2 litres of fuel per 100km, made of recyclable and
primarily bio-based materials, running on electricity or bio-based fuels.
In the residential sector:
Factors coming into play in the medium term:
• for construction:
◦ application of RT2012 from 2015 to 2020 and RT2020 from 2021 onwards.
◦ 330,000 new homes built each year (of which 130,000 social housing) in the periods
2015-2016 and 2022-2035, and 500,000 per year (of which 196,000 social housing)
between 2017 and 2021. Alternative scenarios have allowed us to single out the impact
of this measure, which is social in nature and is not related to France's strategy for
reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We have also been able to model the potential
effects of constructing 850,000 extra homes over a 20-year period. If we were to
remove the "500,000 new homes between 2017 and 2021" target from the reference
scenario, investment in construction would fall by €17 billion between 2017 and 2019,
€26 billion in 2020 and €22 billion in 2021.  
◦ the fight against urban sprawl, with densification of the urban fabric and controls over
the surface area of new homes. A greater proportion of social housing.
• for renovation:
◦ incentives for renovation (CIDD, EcoPTZ, ANAH, EcoPLS) until 2035.
◦ obligation to perform thermal efficiency renovation when undertaking major construction
work.
◦ the combined effect of all support systems available (regional platforms, passports,
third-party funding, guarantee funds for loans intended for 'energy-efficient renovations
in low-income homes and jointly-owned residences', the TEPCV energy-positive
territories scheme and reinforced CEE energy certification scheme now extended to
192035), resulting in an improvement in the quality of renovation work.
◦ by 2030, 59% of homes in France should achieve "average" levels of energy
consumption, while 41% will be "energy-efficient."
This corresponds to a very substantial increase in the number of serious renovation projects
undertaken on existing homes (over 600,000 per year in the reference scenario), without affecting
the number of homes already subject to renovation work with an impact on energy performance
(around 2 million per year in the reference scenario, a level similar to that which prevails at the time
of writing). Given the structural importance of this component, and the extent to which the macro-
economic results will depend upon the types of measure put in place, sensitivity tests have already
allowed us to study the impact of varying levels of household borrowing for the purposes of
financing renovation work.
In the long term, French housing will be more densified and highly energy-efficient: widespread
presence of energy-positive buildings and neighbourhoods; intelligent homes with electrical
consumption and battery charging managed in response to the weather conditions and local
consumption; thermal insulation for natural cooling in the summer months, avoiding the need for air
conditioning even when temperatures are high; construction methods and materials which allow us
to reduce emissions at every stage of a building's life cycle (including during construction and
renovation).
In the tertiary sector:
Factors coming into play in the medium term:
• application of RT2020 standards for some public buildings before 2020, and for all buildings
from 2021 onwards. The introduction of the tertiary-sector decree for buildings of over
1,000m² is expected to facilitate the renovation of 29% of existing buildings by 2030.
Changes in usage habits should also allow us to reduce heating and air conditioning
consumption by 10%. Sensitivity tests have been used to document the impacts on both
greenhouse gas emissions and public budgets of a slower rate of renovation in the tertiary
sector.
• All buildings considered, electricity consumption is expected to fall by 15% by 2030.
In the long term, tertiary-sector buildings should have at least the same level of energy
performance as residential buildings. Furthermore, heat recovery will become widespread.
In the industrial sector:
In the medium-term, increased efficiency (thanks to investments made following energy audits)
should lead to a decrease of almost 20% in energy consumption by 2030. A sensitivity test has
been conducted to assess the impact of an increase in energy efficiency which is less significant
than expected in this sector, both in terms of economic impact and the consequences for
greenhouse gas emissions.  Increased recycling (aluminium, glass and cardboard) and recovery of
some waste heat (10TWh in 2030) should also boost the results from this sector.
In the consumer goods sector:
In the medium term: systematic recycling of biowaste from large producers, sorting and recycling of
glass, paper-card, plastic, metal and wood; reuse of sorted waste and organic household waste.
Existing EPR systems and recycling instructions on packaging will be reinforced. In landfills, the
rate of biogas recovery should be increased from 38% in 2010 to 70% in 2030. The rate of
recovery of biogas should increase from 59% to 80%.
In the long term, quality labels will help consumers choose products manufactured to high
standards in terms of life expectancy and responsible sourcing.  In both cases, products will be
20widely recycled and reused. The market for second-hand goods will be very active. Repairs will
come to represent a significant, highly-structured sector of the economy with a strong focus on
digital technologies and logistics: a new industrial revolution.
The recycling economy will enable us to make significant progress in terms of minimising and
stabilising waste sent to landfill.
In the agricultural sector:
In the medium term, we can take into account the expected effects of the continuation and
reinforcement of existing policies (the Common Agricultural Policy, more support for farmers, the
Organic Ambition strategy, the protein strategy etc.) and the effects of rolling out an effective agro-
ecological strategy on a grand scale.
The reference scenario predicts several key developments in French agriculture:
• the of land take should slow significantly by 2035;
• crop rotation will be greatly increased, with particular emphasis on legumes (for animal
feed), organic farming and low-input production (efficient and minimal use of nitrates);
• livestock farms will become more efficient, with better feed management, efforts to protect
grazing land (especially permanent pastures) and methanisation;
• new methods of carbon capture will be introduced, with the development of agroforestry
systems and the protection or even expansion of hedgerows on both livestock and arable
farms;
• energy efficiency will be significantly improved in all types of agricultural production
(energy-saving practices and renewable energy generation).
Making the reference scenario a reality will require major changes not just for agricultural
operators, but for whole sectors and regions. These developments will serve to reinforce the
competitiveness of French agriculture and all upstream and downstream sectors, not least by
diversifying the available outlets for agricultural goods and ensuring that they are in line with
evolving demand from the market.
In the long term, the agricultural sector will make a significant contribution to reducing greenhouse
gas emissions in four main ways:
• inputs will be managed with maximum efficiency, and sourced primarily from the circular
economy (organic fertilisers and more widespread use of methanisation, by-products for
livestock feed, optimised water use, 2nd-generation biofuels etc.),
• agro-ecological practices, particularly those designed to limit nitrogen loss and increase
carbon capture by the soil, will become widespread (low-ploughing techniques, permanent
ground coverage, hedgerows around all fields, agro-forestry systems etc.),
• new technologies and digital resources will become accessible to all, allowing for more
effective management of farm businesses and their performances, particularly thanks to
new developments in agricultural equipment and buildings,
• the agriculture and forestry sectors will both contribute to the rise of the bioeconomy, with
bio-based products replacing fossil resources.
This transition must also take into account the crucial challenge of adapting to climate change
(crop varieties, water management, environmental risks etc.) and preserving the production
capacity and competitiveness of French agriculture. To make this scenario a reality, all businesses
and chains connected with agriculture (supply, production, transformation, distribution etc.) will
need to undergo a transformation - made possible by greater cohesion - while also improving their
21social, economic and environmental performances. These improvements will help to ensure that
supply is better tailored to the demand from different markets (local, national, European, other
countries), as well as bringing about an evolution in our society's eating habits and expectations.
Greater synergy and the integration of new chains into the bioeconomy will allow us to diversify the
outlets available for agricultural goods (food, non-food uses) and optimise the use of resources;
In the forestry sector:
Developments will include more effective management of forestry stocks which are currently
under-utilised, creating multifunctional forest spaces and ensuring the superior environmental
quality of the economic chains created;
Reminder: this reference scenario is advisory, it is not prescriptive. The explanations given here
are provided primarily for information purposes, and in the interests of transparency regarding the
methodology used to draw up the carbon budgets.

Chapter 2.2.

ECOMMENDATIONS FOR PUBLIC POLICY
3.1. Instruments to be utilised: stakes and synergies
The drafting of sectoral scenarios, translated into advisory carbon budgets, is the first step towards
constructing a national low-carbon strategy. This allows us to identify constraints and stakes, plan
ahead for structural transformations in lifestyles and production methods, and identify potential
routes to success.  
The next stage consists of implementing an appropriate mix of instruments in order to bring about
the desired transformation.
Instrument architecture 
To successfully regulate diffuse emissions, public policy should be designed to incentivise and
boost responsibility, mobilising private stakeholders but maintaining freedom of choice within a
regulated framework, while promoting awareness of the consequences of our choices for society
and for future generations. This will allow us to guide consumption and investment behaviours.
The diagram below provides an overview, distinguishing between two major types of intervention:
• on the one hand, making carbon pricing an integral factor in our decision-making;
• on the other hand, removing or minimising obstacles to the decarbonisation of the
economy.
Aims and instruments of public policies
for a low-carbon strategy
Integrating carbon pricing in decision-making  Removing obstacles to the decarbonisation of the 
economy
Establishing true carbon prices: eco-tax or emissions trading below  Ensuring the acceptability of policies: compensation and support 
an overall limit measures
Removing harmful subsidies Developing information: nudges, labels and CSR
Encouraging green decision-making: Enabling the transformation of the economy 
- standards - R&D, infrastructure, networks
- subsidies and tax credits - professional training
- energy savings certificates - quality of regulations
- calls for tender - finance instruments
In terms of making carbon pricing a natural reflex, this framework places particular emphasis on
establishing appropriate carbon prices with reference to greenhouse gas emissions, offering
incentives for reducing emissions and rewarding investments which avoid emissions. Introducing a
carbon component when setting Domestic Energy Consumption Tax to manage diffuse emissions
within the framework of the 2014 Budget Act is a part of this. The Energy Transition and Green
23Growth Act sets a carbon price target of €56 for 2020 and €100 by 2030 (in 2015 euros). Using
this kind of instrument requires us to tackle the issue of energy poverty and the redistributive
impact of increasing energy prices. France also actively supports proposals to reform the
European CO  quota market, to make it more efficient. Setting reference values ("carbon guide
2
prices") to steer decision-making and guide the trajectory of the price signal is a fundamental
priority. The current state of play in this field, as revealed in the Quinet report, is explored in detail
hereunder. It is also important to bear in mind that other, complementary instruments are available,
such as certificate markets, standards (for results or for resources) and budgetary and fiscal
support programmes.2
One of the major obstacles to decarbonisation is undoubtedly the difficulty of conveying the
collective benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, to which everybody can contribute.
Individuals do not always spontaneously integrate environmental considerations into their
behaviour. Information campaigns thus have a vital role to play.
Moreover, some decarbonisation investments may not provide sufficient benefits to their backers to
make them immediately financially viable. We thus need to remove certain acceptability constraints
connected with purchasing power and questions of competitiveness.
In terms of financing, the markets are not sufficient and can sometimes make it difficult to get long-
term projects up and running. The high degree of uncertainty (environmental, economic,
regulatory)   can   raise   concerns   in   terms   of   risk   valuation,   deterring   potential   investors.
Furthermore, changes in behaviour are often driven by the availability of different assets
(infrastructure, R&D, human capital etc.).
By way of an example, energy renovation in the construction sector requires a combination of
instruments in order to:
• raise awareness of the energy savings which can be made
• make energy savings easier to appropriate (in particular by allocating or splitting them
efficiently between property owners and tenants, or between joint owners) and finance
(financial aid, expanding access to credit),
• take social concerns into consideration (energy poverty)
• boost professional skills in these chains in order to keep costs under control and nurture the
development of private models.3
Taking all of these dimensions into account requires consistent, effective public policy frameworks.
The action framework drawn up by the OECD for 'green investment' is a good example of a
general approach, setting out the different instruments which might be taken into consideration
when developing or implementing a low-carbon strategy (it is also important in its own right,
because green investment is a key factor in the energy transition).

24It highlights the importance of having a clear strategic framework and stable policies.
Different economic instruments can be combined to target objectives which have different time-
frames and resource requirements.
Analysing timeframes
(source: Rethinking cities for the post-carbon society, CGDD (2013))
By way of an example, adapting to a new signal price may require new infrastructure in terms of
energy and transport, extending existing networks (e.g. public transport) but also creating new
networks (carbon capture and storage, charging electric vehicles etc.) and adapting existing
networks to new operating conditions (adapting to climate change) and the possibilities opened up
by new technologies (NICT).
The low-carbon strategy will thus need to combine these different instruments in a coherent
manner, avoiding overlap (particularly between the various instruments integrating carbon pricing)
and diversifying our action (especially when it comes to reconciling the short and long-term
253.2. Cross-cutting recommendations
i. Carbon footprint
1. What does it mean?
Broadly speaking, the challenge is how best to allocate emissions in import/export relationships:
where do we count the emissions generated by the production and transportation of manufactured
goods produced in one country and consumed in another?
The two main approaches to this problem - the 'territorial emissions' method and the 'consumption
emissions' method - both have their strong points, and can therefore complement each other:
• the territorial emissions method places the emphasis on the site of production. This is the
oldest approach, and the approach most commonly used in international agreements. It is
applied when drawing up national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions. It corresponds
to the legal responsibility of States (responsible for the production methods used within
their territory), who may have signed certain commitments on such matters. It is therefore
used to produce the carbon budgets.
• the consumption emissions method - or carbon footprint - places the emphasis on the
site of  consumption. This more recent approach takes into account the practical
consequences of our living standards and consumption habits, and thus focuses on
consumer responsibility. It is worth bearing in mind that this system is subject to certain
technical difficulties, and carries a greater degree of uncertainty than the territorial
emissions method.
• While national inventories are universally-recognised instruments of measurement, they are
not necessarily objectives in their own right, justifying all measures taken to improve the
figures. Indeed, certain actions which might improve this indicator could also have harmful
effects for the economy and the climate. This is known as 'carbon leakage'. One particular
concern is that the offshore transfer of emissions from production serves only to reduce
emissions in the importing country, while the overall climate impact is worse when
production conditions in the producing nation are less strict in terms of their greenhouse
gas emissions.
26• Inversely, an increase in consumption emissions does not necessarily mean that France's
policy of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is failing. If the balance of trade and industrial
structure remain unchanged, an upturn in international exchanges will necessarily lead to a
convergence of greenhouse gas emissions at international level, and thus to an increase in
consumption emissions in those countries whose production capacities are less carbonised
than the global average.
Figure 3.1 : CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions induced in France and abroad by the consumption of people
living in France (carbon footprint) in millions of tons of CO2 equivalent and comparison to the national
inventories for those gases (territorial approach, CITEPA, 2014). Source : SOeS
Conclusion:
• Use of the territorial emissions indicator must be accompanied by enhanced vigilance to
prevent carbon leakage. Instruments offering incentives to reduce territorial emissions
should be designed, calibrated and piloted in such a way as to discourage offshore
transfers and carbon leakage.
• Meanwhile, France's action should not be limited to reducing territorial emissions within the
country, even if this first level of responsibility does take priority and is already covered by
ambitious international commitments. It is also important to give consumers (businesses,
organisations, households) the information and the resources they need to step up to their
own climate change responsibilities via their consumption of goods and services. Overall
carbon footprint should be taken into account at both the sectoral and territorial levels. Last
but not least, dedicated action is required at international level, particularly to reduce
emissions from international transportation.
272. Public policies
Above and beyond France's international objectives and carbon budgets, public policy must also
aim to achieve a reduction in the global carbon footprint. This will require a range of actions:
• for sectoral policies
◦ from now on, the financing of public projects should take into account the impact of
these projects in terms of emissions. That entails promoting life cycle analysis (LCA)
(notably within the regulatory framework and as a project selection criterion for public
contracting authorities). This type of analysis is particularly useful for optimising
transport infrastructure and buildings.
◦ the development of appropriate methodological tools (particularly for evaluation
purposes) to deliver pertinent information to all economic stakeholders, including final
consumers. In this respect, initiatives such as CO   information for transport and
2
experiments with environmental labels need to be developed and expanded.
◦ For the sectors the most exposed to the risk of carbon leaks (delocalisation of activities
in location with lower standards of environmental regulation, detrimental for both the
environment and local jobs), it is important that the instruments aiming at reducing
emissions take into account international competition and do not translate into
delocalisations of activities. Targetted and efficient measures need to be continued and
developped (see section 3.3.v on industry regarding free allocations under the EU-
ETS, but other sectors could also be concerned such as small industry, agriculture and
services).
• for regional policies
In our regions (cf. 3.2. viii Territorial implementation), it may also be useful to take the different
levels (from global carbon footprint down to local impact) into consideration in order to develop
pertinent carbon footprint initiatives. A local approach may serve to motivate stakeholders - cf. the
various efforts to achieve 'carbon-neutral zones'. As such, it is advisable to:
◦ choose indicators with care and a sufficient dose of pragmatism, prioritising coherency
with the policies and levers to be introduced and their potential to reduce emissions,
rather than focusing on theoretical considerations regarding the intrinsic quality of
different indicators.
◦ take 'Scope 3' elements into account, i.e. the indirect emissions induced by an
activity or region in addition to the energy consumption covered by the
greenhouse   gas   emission   accounts   (BEGES)   for   regions,   businesses   &
organisations and projects, with reference to the feasibility of implementing
corresponding levers and their potential efficiency.
• in the specific case of emissions linked to international transport
These extra-territorial emissions are not included in territorial inventories and are not covered by
either the Kyoto protocol or carbon budgets. They are, however, counted in the carbon footprint.
◦ Reducing these emissions falls within the remit of the IMO (International Maritime
Organization) and the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization), who are already
working on emission-reduction measures. France actively backs the introduction of
effective instruments to reduce these international emissions.
◦ Concretely, French businesses and organisations are encouraged to take these
emissions into account in their action plans, particularly via their Greenhouse Gas
Emission Accounts, and by providing information on CO  generated by transportation.
2
Major retailers are also encouraged to cut their transport-related emissions, particularly
via the Freight 21 programme.
283. At individual level, with changes to the way we consume
(cf. Chapter 3.2.vi Education and Awareness) 
Taking all direct and indirect emissions into account, the three biggest contributors to the carbon
footprint generated by household consumption are transport, housing (including energy use) and
food.  
Potential avenues for reducing greenhouse gas emissions at individual level:
Durable goods, transport:
◦ prioritising durable, repairable products
◦ committing to a circular economy, favouring services over ownership:   leasing,
borrowing (use of collaborative platforms), car-pooling, etc., often making it possible to
meet service needs more economically and by emitting fewer greenhouses gases than
through purchasing.
◦ Avoid exaggerated use of long-range transport, including international journey. In daily
life,   increase   the   share   of   active   mobility   (walking,   cycling).    
Housing: simple actions are sufficient to adopt virtuous behaviours which enable to decrease direct
as well as indirect emissions associated with the consumption of energy (see recommendations for
the Residential-Tertiary sector). Realisation of most efficient renovation can also occur on an
increasing scale, taking advantage of the public service for energy efficiency, and latter on the
deployment of the energy renovation passport (Chapter 3.3. ii)
Investment and savings: our first priority is not to invest more, but rather to invest differently by
redirecting funds towards projects that contribute to the energy transition rather than hindering it
(Chapter 3.2.v)
 
Food:
◦ changing eating habits to consume more seasonal produce (preferably locally-sourced)
◦ reducing food waste
◦ reducing our consumption of animal proteins (particularly meat) in favour of more plant-
based proteins (e.g. legumes and cereals: beans, peas, lentils etc.). This will help
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from livestock farming. A number of studies have
demonstrated that adjusting our diets would allow for a substantial reduction in
emissions related to food production, while also meeting our nutritional requirements.4

29ii. Reference price for carbon
1. Evolution of the reference price
A carbon pricing commission, chaired by Alain Quinet, was established in 2008. Its purpose was to
outline a trajectory for carbon pricing which would be compatible with our objectives for the 2020-
2050 time-frame. Utilising economic theory and various hypothetical models, the commission de-
cided upon a CO  price of €100 (2008 euros) per tonne by 2030, adopting a cost-efficient ap-
2
proach to hitting emission reduction targets by 2050. This figure is dependent on various
assumptions regarding energy prices which may make subsequent revisions necessary,
particularly if energy prices (especially fossil fuel prices) vary substantially from the levels
observed when these calculations were made.
This relatively high price reflects the ambitious scale of our greenhouse gas reduction targets and
the difficulties encountered, particularly at organisational level, in deploying low-emission technolo-
gies and successfully changing consumption habits within such a short timeframe. In 2010, the de-
cision was made to select a starting price consistent with the price recommended by the commis-
sion chaired by Marcel Boiteux in 2001, i.e. €32 (2008 euros) per tonne of CO .
2
The commission then mapped out a price trajectory for the period 2010-2050 (see figure 3.2)
based on the following values:
• From 2010 to 2030, carbon prices will rise by 5.8% per annum. This decision is based
on the belief that the transition to high carbon prices must be gradual in order to prioritise
obvious, low-cost carbon reduction solutions which are already available, to avoid
hampering growth and to facilitate the handling of the economic, social and professional
transitions required.
• Beyond 2030: the projected values are based on Hotelling's theory (carbon prices to rise at
discount rate). However, this discount rate was revised by the commission chaired by Emile
Quinet charged with the socio-economic evaluation of French public investments in 2013.
The current recommendation is to apply an annual growth rate of 4.5% (2.5% for the
risk-free discount rate and 2% for the risk premium). Based on these hypotheses, carbon
prices should increase from €100 (2008 euros) per tonne of CO  in 2030 to €2405 (2008
2
euros) in 2050;

302. Applying the carbon guide price to evaluate public decisions
Carbon guide prices serve first and foremost for the socio-economic evaluation of public decisions,
particularly public investments. They are thus already included in the governmental order of 16
June 2014 regarding the evaluation of transport projects. This ensures that the monetary value of
the impact which can be ascribed to the greenhouse gases emitted by a given infrastructure pro-
ject is taken into account when calculating the project's net present value (NPV). As well as analys-
ing investments, this system also allows us to evaluate regulatory choices, consumption beha-
viours etc.
3. Carbon pricing as a point of reference for public policy and economic 
stakeholders
Carbon prices also provide a point of reference for public policies with an influence on the country's
carbon footprint. Here are a few examples:
• Gradual increase of energy taxes: this measure is legitimate because energy taxes cover
all damages, particularly environmental damage, caused to society as a whole by energy
consumption. The introduction of a carbon tax base (based on the quantity of greenhouse
gases generated by the consumption of a given amount of energy) would be a useful addi-
tion to existing energy taxes, and could be increased over time in line with France's targets
for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The 2014 budget introduced a carbon tax in prin-
ciple, incorporated into the domestic taxes on fossil fuels (oil products, gas and coal). The
rate was set at €7/tonne of CO  in 2014, €14.5/ tonne of CO  in 2015 and €22/tonne of CO
2 2 2
in 2016. This gradual deployment should give businesses and households time to adapt.
Nonetheless, in order to stimulate investment a medium-to-long-term price signal needs to
be provided. This forecast should be based on the assumption that carbon taxes will con-
tinue to rise in line with guide prices. The Energy Transition and Green Growth Act sets
a carbon price target of €56 for 2020 and €100 by 2030 (2015 euros).
• Regulating the carbon quota market. Guide prices could also be used to reform the ETS
market in Europe. The current market rate (around €7 per tonne of CO ) is far below the
2
French guide price, and intervention may be required to prepare investors for future price
rises in line with the estimated guide prices required to meet the collective objectives de-
cided upon at European level. In October 2014, the European Council signed off on a new
CO  emissions reduction target of 43% by 2030 for the sectors covered by the EU ETS sys-
2
tem. This will require the introduction of a new mechanism to stabilise the market. The
COP21 conference also provided an opportunity to promote the concept of a global carbon
price, set high enough to allow us to reach our international climate targets. Such a system
would require a network of regional carbon markets and taxes, already up and running or
soon to be launched in many countries (cf. Diagram).
Carbon prices will also serve as a source of information for private stakeholders, as one of the
components which will determine market values in the medium-to-long term.
31With this in mind, it is worth noting that there are already several economic initiatives in place en-
couraging organisations to incorporate carbon prices into their accounting calculations. In 2013,
over 100 businesses from all over the world made declarations to the Clean Development Mechan-
ism (CDM) to the effect that they are already using carbon pricing as a tool to manage the risks
and opportunities connected with their current operations and future profitability.  According to the
World Bank, the business world is in favour of carbon pricing, considering it to be the most cost ef-
ficient way of reducing emissions. As such, a coalition was formed in 2014 in support of interna-
tional carbon pricing. This initiative brings together 73 national governments, 22 cities and other re-
gional entities and over a thousand businesses.

32iii. Research and Innovation Policy
1. Our R&D and innovation policy, a crucial asset in the transition to a low-
carbon economy
The profound transformation required to make the transition to a low-carbon society a success can
only be achieved with a complex combination of technological progress, innovation and profound
changes in the consumption habits of all members of society, from individuals to industrial
designers.
This interconnection between technological and behavioural developments is particularly evident in
the emergence of a functional economy (self-sufficiency, new forms of mobility etc.), an expanded
circular economy (more recycling, efforts to capture all forms of waste heat etc.) and a more bio-
based economy (energy, materials, intermediate products).
Generally speaking, efforts to structure and support R&D and innovation must be extended and
intensified in order to:
• nurture the development and rapid spread of future technologies, moving towards a low-
carbon planet
• in accordance with the Energy Union and its ambition of making Europe the global leader in
renewable   energies,   while   establishing   France's   position   at   the  forefront   of   new
technologies to control energy consumption, emissions and alternatives to fossil fuels.
Technological challenges
In technological terms, regardless of the specific circumstances of each scenario, some choices
are clear-cut. In energy matters, in terms of both supply and demand, these choices include:
energy   efficiency,   widespread   deployment   of   decarbonised   energy   sources   (particularly
renewables), the development of new forms of energy storage, intelligent management of transport
networks and the distribution of this energy, R&D initiatives conducive to the widespread
development of solutions for capturing and storing or re-using carbon.
A low-carbon economy will also require significant technological progress in order to reduce
emissions from non-energy-related sources of greenhouse gases. Systemic change is required in
the following areas: agriculture, development of bio-based products including biochemicals and
biomaterials, CO  recycling and support for organisational innovation.
2
Social and organisational innovation, research in social sciences
Social innovation is also a crucial factor. Certain lifestyle changes which would facilitate the
transition to a low-carbon economy require us to rethink social structures, institutions and
economic models.
Promoting creativity, experimentation, decompartmentalisation and the sharing of experience are
all important factors in developing social innovation.
Research in the social sciences can help us to identify and promote practices conducive to the low-
carbon transition, encouraging citizens to get on board with new measures whose social utility has
been proven.
2. Existing and upcoming plans and strategies
 
At the European level, the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan) aims to foster greater
cooperation in matters of research and innovation, thus galvanising the cost-efficient development
33of low-carbon technologies.
Within this framework, various European Industrial Initiatives (EII) and joint technology firms have
been created, focusing particularly on industrial testing and the promotion of new developments in
wind energy, solar power, bioenergy, CO  capture, storage, transportation and usage, intelligent
2
electrical networks (including storage), nuclear fission (4th generation technologies), smart cities
and communities, hydrogen power and biochemical fuel cells.
The SET-Plan is evolving from a "technological silo' approach towards a more comprehensive,
strategic vision of the energy system. The task of identifying Member States' shared priorities,
which have the potential to become major European priorities in the long term, is accomplished
with the help of an integrated roadmap and accompanying action strategy. Strategic priorities are
thus extrapolated from national priorities.
In France, the national research strategy (SNR) derived from the Law of 22 July 2013 is structured
around ten major societal challenges, including "clean, safe and efficient energy" and "sustainable
urban transport and systems." The pre-existing national energy research strategy (SNRE) will be
incorporated as the 'Energy' aspect of this plan (Article 183 of the Energy Transition and Green
Growth Act), finalised for official adoption in early 2016.
On an operational level, and with regard to research projects still in their infancy (technology which
is not yet mature, with a low TRL6), for the two priorities mentioned above (energy and sustainable
urban transport and systems) the National Research Agency (ANR) will afford priority to those
actions identified by the SNR as being especially important. The ANR has created a category
entitled 'Exploration of disruptive innovation' to accelerate the development of new technologies
with particularly strong potential.
Backing up these sources of funding, further support for applied research (highest TRL ratings) and
innovation demonstration is available via the Future Investment Programme (PIA) launched in
2012. Phase two of this scheme (PIA2) was launched in 2014, offering financial backing for
"vehicles and transport systems of the future" and "technologies demonstrating the ecological and
energy transition." The PIA scheme is run by ADEME, whose own research programme is also
focused on nurturing the development and implementation of a national system of energy
technologies and services, working towards our goal of a low-carbon society prepared for the
challenges of climate change.
In terms of the energy transition, the goal is to demonstrate, in real operational conditions,
technologies and practices which allow us to save energy or natural resources and reduce CO
2
emissions while generating the same amount of energy. The goal is to develop these technologies
into commercially-viable solutions offering energy production costs similar to those of carbon-
reliant options: a general target of €100/MWh has been set for 2020.
3. Existing challenges which the innovation policy must take into account in
order to guarantee the success of the low-carbon transition
R&D and innovation efforts need to cover a broad spectrum of concepts in order to foster the
emergence and widespread adoption of developments which will allow us to attain the energy
transition targets set out in Article 1 of the PLTECV (see diagram below). This process will require
a detailed but wide-ranging understanding of the major societal (lifestyle changes, resistance to
change etc.) and technological (e.g. integrating renewable energies into the grid, interactions
between the gas, heat and electrical networks, improving energy efficiency, breakthroughs in the
performance of low-carbon technologies at competitive prices) challenges involved.
6 TRL: Technology Readiness Level, a scale running from 1 (basic principles observed and reported) to 9 (actual system
successfully tested in operational conditions), via intermediary stages including experimental proof of concept (TRL3) to
prototype demonstration in an operational environment (TRL7).
34Broadly speaking, the technology innovation support policy must:
• Be based on high-level fundamental and applied research, particularly by:
- offering continuous support for collaborative projects, above and beyond allocating public
resources to R&D (funding public research, supporting private research and taking into account the
shared benefits of innovation),
- regularly updating the technological roadmaps and facilitating coordination between stakeholders,
who will share the benefits of new innovations,
- offering a long-term strategic vision for the future of research, with stable public policies on low-
carbon energy technologies.
• Support the development of innovative companies capable of producing disruptive
technological advances,
• Facilitate the adoption and spread of disruptive innovations conducive to the transition to a
low-carbon economy, particularly via financial support for experimentation and the creation
of the training structures required to ensure their penetration, development and long-term
viability (maintenance, technological development)
• Ensure that consumption habits and lifestyle factors are taken into consideration by
research and development projects, as well as technologies and production methods.
Develop this approach to support the spread of new technologies (analysing their social
relevance and the conditions for their appropriation by consumers, cf. for example Section
3.3 on the residential-tertiary sector) but also upstream in the research phase (analysing
the expectations and requirements of stakeholders from a social angle: "making the city;"
relationship to work; "intelligent buildings" etc.).
This support for technological innovation should also seek to:
• guarantee the financial profitability of innovations contributing to the low-carbon transition
whose socio-economic impact is positive
• ascribe an economic value to reducing emissions (e.g. long-term carbon guide prices, see
Section 3.2.ii)
• provide tools capable of estimating reductions in greenhouse gas emissions
• promote infrastructure developments capable of catalysing innovation
• ensure that the risk associated with investing in the deployment of low-carbon innovation is
borne by those most able to handle it (see the Investment section)
35Generally speaking, it is important that we do not approach this challenge in a segmented manner.
Interactions within the innovation system will be beneficial to all stakeholders, as they make the
gradual improvements and major technological breakthroughs required to meet our climate targets.
Governance which includes representatives of civil society would help foster exchanges between
researchers and those bodies represented in the CNTE, particularly when it comes to drafting the
national energy research strategy.
It is vitally important that we remove all obstacles to the adoption and spread of innovation,
including incremental innovations. In this respect, we must stress the crucial importance of best
practices (training etc.), social innovation and the progress which can be made via gradual
improvements to systems of production, including changes spearheaded by employees, citizens
and SMEs. In terms of social innovation, the national government's role is both to:
1. act strategically, identifying areas of change which can be achieved in the medium term and
supporting positive developments;
2. serve as facilitator and promoter, encouraging experimentation and innovation (life-size
decentralised programmes / initiatives from civil society / greater responsibilities for local
authorities as project owners).
4. Indicators to monitor the performance of the research and innovation 
policy
Any number of the following indicators may be used:
• public spending on R&D (including European instruments) linked to the reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions (including sums allocated to public-sector R&D in the energy
sector)
• number of publications and theses produced in this field
• number of collaborative projects focusing on the energy transition and low-carbon energy
(and the sums involved).
• number of patents registered and licences granted for technologies linked to the reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions
• number of spin-offs and start-ups created in this field
• value of Future Investments in the energy and ecological transition: knock-on effect on
private investment, conclusions of the assessments conducted under the PIA.
36iv. Town planning and development policy
National and regional town planning and development policies can also have a major impact on
greenhouse gas emissions. Their effects are extremely long-lasting, as changing the structure of
an urban development is a difficult and very slow task. The various decisions taken on a day-to-
day basis by public and private stakeholders - developing a plot of land, choosing the way it will be
used, deciding on the energy performance of the equipment installed, for example - are governed
by a complex web of regulations, economic considerations and social aspirations which form a
relatively unmoving whole (at least in the short term).
The transition to a low-carbon economy requires us to adjust the balance of this system, identifying
mechanisms for change and assessing their impact in the short, medium and long term. A balance
needs to be found, with a systemic, integrated approach across all levels of decision-making and
regional authority, from regions down to neighbourhoods.
1. National priorities and objectives
a) Halting the artificialisation of natural spaces, while ensuring our ability to meet the needs
of our people
Urban sprawl and the consumption of natural spaces are the fruit of a combination of causes. First
and foremost: rurbanisation. This phenomenon is linked to the polarisation of employment and the
lack of sufficient accommodation to meet demand, particularly in large conurbations. This also
leads to people commuting over longer distances, with a corresponding increase in greenhouse
gas emissions.
In France, urban sprawl has taken on different forms in different periods. Peri-urban expansion was
at its strongest in the early 1960s. In this period, the desire for a different lifestyle to that offered by
the densely-populated city centre was facilitated by the development of new transport infrastruc-
tures and the generalisation of motorised transportation reducing journey times (particularly for
commuters), as well as the fact that buying a detached house in the suburbs was cheaper than
buying in the city centre (cost of construction and cost of land).
This rapid urban spread, structured by the creation of Priority Urbanisation Zones (ZUP) between
1958 and 1968 with strong support from the government, was followed by several decades of in-
formal sprawl.
The urban sprawl has developed under the cumulative effect of socio-economic interactions and
specific, local spatial and environmental constraints. While the process was accelerated by the im-
provement of transport networks and mobility, various micro and macro-socioeconomic factors are
also at play: the property market, demographic developments, the attractiveness of urban areas
and individual residential preferences.
This trend for urban expansion reflects the aspiration of many families7 for lifestyles based around
owning their own individual, detached home8. Construction firms have also prioritised expansion
over urban intensification and renewal, primarily for reasons of financial viability and the lack of
adequate property opportunities. The process of urban sprawl - which, as well as housing, is also
the result of development models based on a vast network of roads and corresponding
commercial, logistical and industrial networks - has made land sealing an almost irreversible
inevitability.
7 Source: S. Diefal, S. Eugène, Être propriétaire de sa maison, Crédoc (2004)
8 In the majority of cases, families' residential aspirations are marked by a preference for detached houses. Although the rate of
construction slowed between 2003 and 2013, individual houses still account for over 56% of total new house builds (source: SOeS,
Sit@del). A key factor in the consumption of agricultural land and the occupation of peri-urban and rural spaces, the spread of widely
spaced-out detached houses can also lead to lengthy commutes for those families who are determined to own their own home.
37Artificialisation of land today
Rate of artificialisation
Artificial surfaces continue to expand, though this rate of expansion has been stable
since 2008. After peaking at 830 km2 between 2006 and 2008 (+ 1.8% per year),
artificial surfaces grew by 540 km2 per annum between 2008 and 2014 (+1.1% per
year). This slowdown can be partly attributed to the economic crisis, the decline in the
number of farmers taking retirement since 2009 and local development policies aimed
at protecting agricultural land, natural areas and forests.
Causes
Looking at the problem in terms of artificialised land, 49% of land converted to artificial
use between 2006 and 2014 was destined for housing (of which 46% for detached
homes, a huge majority), 20% was converted for transport purposes (16% for roads)
and the rest was split between other commercial and leisure facilities (31%). In terms of
total land sealing  (land built upon, tamped or tarmacked), housing accounts for a
smaller proportion: 34%, compared with 28% for transport networks and 38% for other
economic activities and leisure facilities. 57% of land taken up by new houses is
occupied by lawns and gardens.
Source: Agreste (2015). Agreste Primeur n°326, Land Use.
The consequences of this sealing include a fundamental transformation of the natural environment,
with a substantial decrease in the amount of carbon9 stored by plants and soils.
One of the great difficulties is that the various stakeholders (public and private) take the socio-
economic effects of artificialisation into account only partially when presenting their investment
decisions. This is particularly true of carbon release and infrastructure development (roads,
networks etc.), with the cost of the latter only partially borne by developers. This makes
artificialisation more profitable than renovating or reusing areas which have already been
urbanised. Our objective is to halt overall artificialisation,10 while ensuring that we are still
able to meet the requirements of our society, particularly in terms of housing.  The reference
scenario is based on a hypothetical 80% reduction in artificialisation by 2035 followed by a total
halt hereafter, given the complexity of the challenges involved and the need to disrupt the strong
underlying   trends   and   dynamics   which   drive   artificialisation.   Efficiently   combating   the
artificialisation of soils raises various questions regarding our capacity to make effective use of
available land resources and increase housing capacities while nurturing local development.
A point to bear in mind: meeting this ambitious target will require strong measures to reform the
property and land markets. Special attention must be paid to the redistributive consequences of
regulating land use, all the more so since lower-income households are more likely to set up home
on the periphery of urban areas, taking into account the price of land, property and transport.
b) Generalising the existing territorial system with a post-carbon approach
Above and beyond the environmental impact of urban sprawl, there is a strong social dimension
9 On average, a hectare of cultivated land converted to artificial use is held to be equivalent to 61 teq of net carbon release over 20
years. The figure is 134 teq for a hectare of previously untouched land. Artificialisation of one hectare of land can also account for as
much as 24 teq CO2/year in terms of lost plant production.
10 Considering the land sector (land use and land use changes) as a whole.
38which will become increasingly acute in the near future: spending on travel (often under-estimated
or ignored when buying a house) combined with high rent/house prices and poor energy efficiency
in individual homes could see low-income households facing the risk of both energy and transport
poverty.
For local authorities, more diffuse housing also generates urban development costs which can
weigh heavily on local finances: extending and connecting rail networks, the electricity grid, digital
connections, creating new services and facilities, public transport etc.
In order to halt the artificialisation of land and adapt the existing model, we will need to develop
differentiated solutions which respect the diversity of the territories at hand (urban, rural, isolated,
mono-functional etc.). We also need to back policies focused on regenerating city centres,
consolidating multi-nodal dynamics, multi-functional and natural spaces in towns, up-building,
network adaptation etc.
In doing so, we must respond to a series of major challenges and objectives:
• Adapting   development   strategies   to   local   conditions,  prioritising   high-density
development structured around transport networks, services and jobs in urban centres. In
rural territories, we can encourage the use of local renewable resources to make bio-
based materials and products as well as energy, particularly to help meet the energy
requirements   of   buildings.   Nevertheless,   developing   renewable   energies   (including
bioenergies) will require us to use some land. Incentive policies must therefore take into
account all land usage requirements. We also need to adopt a comprehensive approach to
land management, considering questions of solidarity between different spaces in order to
boost their resilience. There are numerous opportunities for synergy which can have a
positive impact on greenhouse gas emissions, for example: producing renewable energy in
less densely-populated regions to supply big cities, local distribution networks for food
products, supporting local producers and cutting down on transportation requirements.
• Building in areas already used for construction (brownfield sites) to halt the
consumption of greenfield land.  Current policy is firmly focused on renovating the
existing urban fabric, reconverting brownfield sites and using land more efficiently to avoid
further sprawl while maintaining a high standard of living for city-dwellers.
• Adapting urban development to local configurations In dense urban zones, which are
by their nature well-connected and well-equipped, other forms of development may be
utilised, such as semi-collective housing formats and upwards extension of existing
buildings.11 Semi-collective housing developments, well situated in urban centres, offer
higher rates of occupation density (40 to 60 homes/hectare) and strike a balance between
effective land use and acceptable population density. But densification is not desirable
in all areas, nor in the same manner.12 Some rural and suburban areas need to work on
protecting remaining agricultural land and natural spaces, as well as sparsely-populated
zones, for the benefit of the population as a whole.  These new forms of urban
development will need to incorporate an integrated approach to networks, taking into
account   energy   networks   (heating   etc.)   and   communications   networks   (digital
development).
• Rethinking the role of nature in the city, with a comprehensive vision covering all
11 Upwards extension of existing buildings, though sometimes complex in engineering terms, is nonetheless a useful way of keeping
urban sprawl under control and boosting energy performance in some jointly-owned residences, particularly in light of recent regulatory
developments (cf. the Order of 3 October 2013 on the development of construction and housing).
12, The densification of existing areas can cause problems if it is not handled correctly: traffic, space management, heat pockets etc. The
challenge here is not only to densify the existing urban fabric, but to foster the emergence of new living environments which are energy-
efficient, suited to the environmental context and well-endowed with transport options to minimise pollution. Not only this, but we must
also develop renewable energies to supply the needs of these new buildings.
39aspects of the ecosystem. This will allow us to improve quality of living for residents and
meet the challenges of adaptation, regulation etc.
• Bringing residential areas closer to business areas. We need to promote a multi-
functional approach to town planning, cutting down on transport times and sound pollution,
protecting air quality and avoiding the formation of urban heat pockets. This also raises the
issue of creating more local jobs, as well as nurturing local networks and the circular
economy. It is also important to ensure the availability of affordable housing in our
metropolises and major conurbations, making sure that low and middle-income households
are able to live in urban centres.
• A new approach to mobility, with a diverse array of transport options which are an integral
component of urban development. In built-up areas, more effective organisation of urban
functions should foster the development of public transport. In rural areas, where people
are heavily dependent on private vehicles, alternative mobility solutions involving cars can
be found: car-sharing, lift sharing etc. In all cases, active forms of mobility (walking and
cycling) must take pride of place in territorial development plans. Future urban development
needs to take climate change into account (shade in public spaces, drinking fountains etc.)
as well as the challenges posed by our ageing population. (for more on mobility and
transport cf. 3.3.i)
• Rethinking commercial zones and large-scale amenities: many commercial centres,
logistical platforms, airports and ports are located on the outskirts of towns and cities, with a
major impact on transport arrangements and the artificialisation of surrounding land.
Changes need to be made to optimise their positioning, regulate out-of-town commercial
zones and reinvigorate town centres, and plan for the redevelopment/reconversion of these
peripheral areas.
2. Compromise, recommendations and development drivers
a) Promoting innovation in all its forms
• Promoting innovations which contribute to energy efficiency and self-sufficiency, be they
technological or social: supporting bottom-up initiatives, city-specific transition plans, slow
cities etc. (initiatives piloted by citizens, joint construction of public policy etc.).
b) Improving urban performance in towns and metropolises
• Optimising the use of space and facilities: urban temporalities, occupancy rate of homes
and public facilities, versatility and reversibility.
• Capitalising on flows and nurturing the circular economy: simplicity and efficacy of urban
services, reuse of materials, urban recycling, urban renewal and reconversion of brownfield
sites, waste reduction, energy recuperations, ecological engineering etc.
• Developing natural resources in the city with a view to protecting the ecosystem and
encouraging the spread of urban agriculture; Defending peri-urban agriculture, protecting
farmed land and nurturing short distribution circuits, without neglecting the importance of
large agricultural and natural zones in rural environments;
• Making active mobility (walking and cycling) an attractive option for the able-bodied, and
making intra-city transport accessible.
c) Fostering the development of innovative, energy-efficient rural regions, in synergy with
our metropolises
As we seek, individually and collectively, to adopt a lifestyle which generates less CO  in more
2
sparsely-populated areas, there are several recommendations we can make:
• Working to rethink the way we get around (ride-sharing zones, car-share programmes)
40• Encouraging local living (cutting distances between home-work-other activities, expanding
the option of remote working for compatible professions)
• Helping families and regions to take control of their consumption practices (self-sufficiency,
understanding of energy usage etc.)
• Developing activities in complementarity and solidarity with metropolitan areas: food
production, bio-resources, recreation, water management and purification.
d) Protecting natural spaces and agricultural land, taking their role as carbon sinks into
account when developing future projects
• Taking into account the environmental and climate-related benefits of agricultural land
(farms, production chains etc.) and natural spaces in regional development plans.
• Strong action to preserve natural resources and their capacity to capture and store carbon
e) Preparing the governance and regulatory tools of tomorrow
• Giving local authorities the methodological tools they need to develop an integrated
approach   to   urban   development   and   transport,   ensuring   the   coherency   and
complementarity of   all  official  documents (Regional  Development  Plans,  Territorial
Cohesion Plans, PCAET, PLU, PLUI, PDU, PLH) which translate our objectives for the
energy transition, climate change and the development of the green economy into practical
terms;
• Supporting local authorities as they take the lead in developing territorial strategies (e.g. the
role of mayors in granting planning permission and managing conflicts of interest with
regard to urban sprawl which would generate new property taxes and create new homes
(and often new jobs), while the corresponding investment required in networks is often
largely subsidised by other levels of local government, particularly county councils).
• Boosting the legal capacities of local authorities (metropolitan areas and inter-municipal
groupings) in order to keep a lid on property speculation, urban sprawl and functional
and/or socio-cultural ghettoisation.
• Devoting particular attention to this issue during the first revision of this strategy.
f) Guiding and supporting decision-making with assessment and monitoring tools
• Encouraging the spread of simple tools for assessing the direct and indirect impact of
projects in terms of greenhouse gas emissions (inspired by carbon budgets, NECATER,
GES-URBA, the carbon barometer etc.) and highlighting, where possible, joint benefits or
points of overlap with other ecological, social and economic issues;
• Developing tools to observe and analyse flows of energy and materials between regions, as
well as evaluation methods capable of highlighting the cost-benefit performance of projects
in the short, medium and long terms, adopting an approach which is cross-cutting and not
sector-specific.
41v. Financial priorities and guiding investment
1. Current state of affairs and carbon challenges
In terms of the financing of low-carbon trajectories, the issue of finding extra financial
resources is not a major concern. In fact, the increased investment required to finance a
trajectory which takes climate constraints into account is 5% compared with standard
investments worldwide,13 with a similar figure found at national level and incorporated into
the reference scenario. Our ability to direct investment towards activities compatible with a
'decarbonised' economy is, however, the major financial challenge facing the transition to a
low-carbon economy. This applies to both public and private financing. Given the scale of
investment required, the latter will necessarily provide the lion's share of the financial
resources dedicated to the low-carbon economy.14
Guiding these investment flows requires us to effectively manage the supply and demand
of capital, as well as the instruments connecting the two:
• Capital demand includes all policies aimed at boosting the economic and financial
attractiveness of "green" projects - improving the yield-to-risk ratio, making
technology accessible etc.;
• Capital supply depends on the financial sector and its capacity to support change in
an orderly manner;
• The aim of connecting instruments is to ensure that the financial channels flow
smoothly from the sources of capital - savings, institutional investor etc. - to the
areas where spending is required. They include instruments such as securitisation
and green bonds.
Risks and opportunities: the carbon challenge and the financial sector
The challenges posed by climate change and the energy transition for players on the financial
markets are two-fold, particularly for institutional investors and other players focused on the long
term:15  
• The energy transition requires us to target investments in a manner which is consistent with
our emission reduction targets, committing substantial resources in the process.  Financing
the energy transition will thus open up significant opportunities.
• On the other hand, climate change and energy concerns also bring with them substantial
risks for the majority of financial institutions. The general acknowledgement of the
importance of integrating these concerns into operational decisions is a relatively recent
development, but it received a spectacular boost at the UN climate summit in September
2014, with ambitious projects regarding the placement of assets by institutional managers
and investors.
The carbon challenge will be a crucial priority for financial stakeholders in the medium term
For financial stakeholders, the challenges posed by climate change and the energy transition are

at between €20 and €25 billion in 2011 (CDC Climate Research 2014).

42two-fold. On the one hand, they are exposed to the consequences of climate change (via the
exposure of the counterparties which they finance). On the other hand, they are also exposed to
the consequences of political efforts to reduce emissions, which will become more restrictive the
later we leave it (risks associated with stranded assets and the possible formation of a 'carbon
bubble’, linked to the economic valuation of fossil fuel reserves which may have to be left in the
ground). Several studies have demonstrated the need for the financial sector to align itself with a
low-carbon trajectory, but for the time being it is still heavily invested in fossil fuels. This only
serves to increase the costs associated with reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the course
of the century, due to delays caused by technological and organisation lock-in and the impact of
climate change16 (cost of inaction).
Given the regulatory risks and the importance of planning ahead for the effects of climate change,
it is in the best interests of institutional investors to take these considerations into account in the
analysis and operational management of their investment portfolios, steering existing funds
towards low-carbon investments. The interests of institutional investors should thus be aligned with
the interests of society at large.
On the financial markets, a number of promising tools are under development…
These tools, designed to nurture the emergence of a 'decarbonised' economy, can be grouped into
three broad categories:
• Instruments aimed at steering investment towards the green economy, with direct and
more-or-less certified investments in low-carbon assets (e.g. green bonds, eco-labels for
investment funds contributing to the energy and ecological transition etc.);
• "low-carbon" management initiatives, including signposting of the carbon footprint of assets,
allowing investors to exclude or minimise carbon-intensive assets, which are generally
over-represented in the available indices and thus attract substantial capital flows;
• shareholder action, exerting pressure - by means of direct dialogue or the use of
voting rights - on companies to act in an environmentally-responsible manner
… but running up against the sticky issue of measuring climate performance
Financial analysts are heavily dependent on the information provided in advance by investment
issuers, which goes some way to explaining the difficulties encountered in finding funding for
energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. At the same time, in light of the substantial
influence they exert, they have a responsibility to accelerate the development of 'carbon metrics'
which will allow us to assess exposure and sensitivity to climate and energy developments.
Efforts to quantify carbon risk are still in their infancy. Such analyses remain restricted to a handful
of industries, which prevents us from achieving a comprehensive evaluation of total exposure to
climate and carbon risk, and the scale of the consequences. However, new tools are currently in
development - such as the Sustainable Energy Investment (SEI) Metrics promoted by the
European Commission and the system of carbon stress-tests - which aim to analyse the impact of
climate-energy scenarios on asset portfolios. Another initiative, the Beyond Ratings project,17 aims
to assign grades to sovereign bonds based on their climate credentials.
2. Strategy
Working hand in hand with other sources of financing, the financial sector has a central role
to play and must step up to its responsibilities in terms of funding sustainable development and the
16 In certain sectors, such as reinsurance, this risk has already materialised in the form of a substantial increase in costs.
Further developments in climate conditions could aggravate these costs over the coming years (coastal flooding, heat
waves etc.). Although the figure is well below the annual average for the past ten years ($188M/year), natural and man-
made disasters cost the global economy $113M (approx. €90.5) in 2014, compared with $135M (approx. €108M) in 2013

43ecological transition.  The mobilisation of the financial sector needs to be threefold: first and
foremost in terms of risk management, then as a source of funding for the real economy and finally
in terms of their own social and institutional responsibility.
In order to lead the way in changing investment practices, France is already equipped with
a raft of forward-thinking regulatory tools, including Article 224 of Law 2010-788 (12 July 2010) on
national environmental commitments, which obliges management firms to provide non-financial
reports on the way they take social, environmental and governance quality criteria into
consideration in their investment policies.  France may shortly become the first country to demand
that institutional investors submit non-financial reports providing information on the actions taken to
further the energy and ecological transition and tackle the challenges of climate change (Article
173 of the Energy Transition and Green Growth Act).
Public policy-makers have a duty to reinforce these foundations, going beyond carbon pricing to
effectively coordinate the various incentive schemes in six main ways:
2.1 Supporting the development of 'low-carbon' asset management
French institutional investors and fund managers are already committed to a strategy of promoting
green investments to reduce our carbon footprint and ecological impact, while also reducing the
exposure of their portfolio to carbon risk. This process should be supported and expanded with the
creation of new labels and indices, more effective management of environmental risk factors and
stricter environmental eligibility criteria for projects applying for export credits.
In the short term, priority should be afforded to developing a new incentive in the form of an
"energy and ecological transition" label for investment funds.
2.2 Ensuring that financial stakeholders take carbon risk into account in their operational
decisions
Faced with a potentially serious risk, financial stakeholders need to integrate environmental criteria
into their operational decision-making processes. As well as promoting more comprehensive risk
analysis, the goal for policy-makers is to ensure that carbon risk is taking into account on an
operational level.
Furthermore - and with specific reference to long-term financial partners such as institutional
investors, due to the fact that low-carbon investments are necessarily long-term commitments - the
existing accounting framework (and, in some cases, its relationship to the prudential framework) is
not suited to the business models of these stakeholders nor, by extension, to the analysis of low-
carbon investment strategies.
As financial stakeholders are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of these issues,
policy-makers need to continue systematically and regularly pushing for the adaptation of the IFRS
accounting standards to better represent our long-term financing requirements, specifically for the
ecological transition and including SMEs. The development of 'carbon stress-tests' is an interesting
prospect.
2.3 Reinforcing the support available for operational research into the development of
'carbon metrics’
The current methods used to measure carbon emissions do not allow for a comprehensive
overview of a portfolio's exposure to carbon risk (emissions financed), nor do they allow for a
forward-looking approach enabling investors to ensure that they are in line with greenhouse gas
reduction targets. The 'science' here is still young, and this is a pioneering initiative in need of
consolidation. Public policy-makers have a key role to play in supporting R&D and innovation.
Obviously, this support only makes sense if it contributes to the efforts going on at international
level;18 the aim here is to bolster national initiatives and help them to gain traction in a context
which remains dominated by ideas from the English-speaking world.
18 Government support for the 2° Investing Initiative and the Riskergy consortium are examples of this approach in
action.
442.4. Improving the non-financial reporting of institutional investors
Institutional investors handle substantial assets, with a responsibility to secure the enduring
financial viability of their commitments to clients, subscribers, members and affiliates.
One form of action thus consists of increasing the information available to the clients, subscribers,
members and affiliates of institutional investors, with regard to the ways in which the investment
policies operated by the latter take environmental criteria into account, and the resources allocated
to furthering the energy and ecological transition. This might take the form of a dedicated non-
financial report, providing clients, subscribers, members and affiliates with the relevant information
and helping them to choose those institutional investors who are most attuned to climate and
energy concerns.
2.5 Creating a space for dialogue and exchange between policy-makers, private and public
institutional investors and representatives of civil society
The purpose of such a space - whose form and rules will need to be defined in further detail, but
which should certainly based on the principle of open discussion - would be to boost cohesiveness
and encourage synergy between different initiatives (of which there are a multitude since COP21)
which are not currently well co-ordinated, with each initiative developing on its own terms. The goal
would be to encourage the creation of climate-compatible financial mechanisms, tools and
instruments,19 pushing investors to develop a genuine low-carbon strategy including firm targets
and a detailed roadmap. In the long term, this system could help with the sector-by-sector
implementation of the national low-carbon strategy. Further reflection is also needed on non-
economic barriers such as lack of information and lack of sufficient training.
It seems clear that the scope of this reflection should not be limited to the national sphere, and that
it should make full use of all available resources (feedback from the major carbon initiatives
already up and running; national and international best practices which will, in the near future,
feature in the COP21 Agenda of Solutions; major climate conferences aimed at investors;
promoting national initiatives; proposals for 'carbon metrics' etc.).
2.6 Opening up access to financing for low-carbon projects, renewable energies, energy
efficiency initiatives and the circular economy
The first priority is to remove liquidity and access constraints for individuals, businesses and public
bodies keen to launch projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, produce renewable energy,
improve energy efficiency or boost the circular economy.
Various levers and mechanisms can be envisaged to help us achieve this goal: upgrading existing
systems (for example increasing financial incentives for energy-efficient renovation work, and
means-tested subsidies for households), developing a specialised intermediary service to facilitate
funding of projects of all sizes (third-party financing, public participation in financing, companies set
up to finance green energy etc.), government intervention in financing mechanisms (co-financing
from borrowing and equity, green loans offered by BPI France, loans underwritten by the
government, monetary mechanisms).20 In order to boost their efficiency, these mechanisms may
also be backed up with non-financial measures: boosting capacities, providing information (green
loan brokers, for example) etc.
2.7 Systematically promoting low-carbon measures in the financial support provided to
19
 Cf. Measures 5.a & b of the Road Map drafted at the 2014 environment conference.
20 Since the European Central Bank considers the low-carbon transition to be central to the resilience of the Eurozone's
monetary and financial system, the bank should be entitled to intervene in various ways to facilitate the financing of this
transition. The central bank could, for example, add carbon assets to its asset purchase programme. The value of these
assets, generated by reductions in emissions, would be backed by a public guarantee corresponding to a reference price
for carbon defined at national (or European) level.
45public projects.
In application of Article L222-1B of the Environment Code, instated by the Energy Transition and
Green Growth Act (ETGGA), financial support for public projects must systematically take the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions into consideration.
The principles and methods used to calculate greenhouse gas emissions from public projects will
be determined by decree. In accordance with the present strategy, priority will be afforded to a life
cycle approach wherever sufficient data is available, taking the reliability of this information into
account. Evaluating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is also a pertinent way of
assessing alternatives to these public projects.
2.8 Development aid and support for the international expansion of French businesses
Providing incentives in the form of development aid and support for the international expansion of
French businesses is also a major priority.
Strategic initiatives have already been put in place to keep track of the investments made in this
respect. The French Development Agency monitors the evolution of climate-related projects as a
proportion of its total portfolio. This monitoring is based largely on the so-called 'Rio markers',
identifying the major categories of anti-climate change actions, or initiatives with other objectives
but which also offer significant ecological benefits.21
The qualifying criteria for export credits were reviewed in September in 2015, and are consistent
with the priorities of domestic energy policy in that they demand the immediate removal of export
credits for all new coal-fired power stations without carbon capture technology.
From a quantitative perspective, the target announced by France at the United Nations General
Assembly in September 2015 is to increase funding for climate projects by €2 billion by 2020,
increasing the annual pot from €3 to €5 billion.
21The same logic can be applied to other objectives such as protecting biodiversity, allowing us to promote options which
contribute to several components of the ecological transition simultaneously.
46vi. Education, awareness, appropriation of challenges and 
solutions by citizens
Bearing in mind the ambitions set out in the National Strategy for the Ecological Transition and
Sustainable Development (NSETSD 2015-2020) and the various roadmaps for the ecological
transition, our recommendations for education and awareness-raising correspond to the objective
of giving citizens the means and resources to understand global developments and the challenges
of the energy transition, enabling them to make an active contribution to the national low-carbon
strategy.
Complementing and co-existing with the recommendations set out in Part vii. regarding
professional training, these proposals require us to deploy a diverse array of techniques to educate
and stimulate awareness, involvement and participation among citizens of all ages.
1. Schools and higher education
Our priorities must be to:
• Take full account of the stakes, practices and key skills associated with climate challenges,
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy self-sufficiency and efficiency and renewable
energies when updating the curriculum for primary and secondary schools, guiding young
people towards professions which will be essential for the energy transition.
• Make higher education a leading force in the energy transition, boosting the skill level of
public and private sector employees and managers as we move towards a low-carbon
economy. Updating courses to reflect the latest advances in research and the need for
professionals to keep pace with these changes.
• Organise, reinforce and develop the training provided to trainers, teachers and other
educators regarding the stakes of the energy transition and climate change.
• Complete our analysis of the general key skills required by the industrialisation of new
energy technologies (intelligent systems and vectors, renewable and decarbonised energy,
managing demand etc.), and maintaining high levels of these skills.
• Support the development of engineering activities related to new energy technologies,
derived from advances in research.
• Facilitate and support the involvement of educational institutions and extra-
curricular organisations in the deployment of grass-roots actions from the regional
energy transition plans and strategies, fostering green growth locally (the Climate-Air-
Energy Plan (PCAET); Regional Climate-Air-Energy Strategies (SRCAE); Territories for
Energy Transition and Green Growth (TEPCV) and "Zero waste"; Regional Strategies for
the Circular Economy, etc.).
Coordinate these actions with:
• - projects led by agricultural schools and colleges, developing a 360° approach to
sustainable   development,
- extra-curricular schemes,  
• and approved projects run by institutions such as holiday centres, leisure centres, scout
troops etc.
• Accelerate the process of making schools and universities sustainable, helping educational
institutions to lead the way in matters of energy performance and, more broadly, social
responsibility.
• Recruit energy/flow efficiency managers in all educational institutions by 2020, in
accordance with the objectives of strategic plans such as the 'Campus d'@venir'
programme. Promote and facilitate the involvement of students with these strategic plans,
and in the energy transition charters drawn up by higher education associations.
47• Develop experiments with new energy management practices at test facilities in higher
education institutions (e.g. thermal insulation, energy recovery and storage, geothermal
energy, managing energy demand).
2. Raising awareness and boosting participation
Our priorities must be to:
• Promote and develop experimentation and grass-roots innovation at local level, helping to
change habits and ease the transition to a low-carbon economy.
• Mobilise and support young people as they come to terms with the stakes of the ecological
transition.
• Deploy and develop a wide-ranging programme of civic service initiatives for the energy
transition, the climate and biodiversity. For example, youth organisations were actively
involved in preparations for COP21 via the COY initiative and numerous educational
projects.
• Develop and reinforce multi-party partnerships for shared, concerted educational initiatives
focusing on the environment, as well as local actions to raise awareness and involvement
(e.g. energy-positive families, open workshops, artistic, sporting and cultural projects etc.)
• Consolidate and develop public participation in the implementation of regional projects and
action strategies focused on creating a low-carbon economy
• Open up participative tools at local level (public debates, environmental consultations, local
correspondents, mediators, participative charters, local policies etc.)
• Experiment with local shared responsibility schemes
• Promote the dissemination and sharing of information on the national low-carbon strategy
(SNBC), with a strong emphasis on digital communication tools.
3. Consumer information and responsibility
Our priorities must be to:
• Promote and facilitate the development of collaborative consumption practices (energy
efficiency and self-sufficiency, reducing our consumption of new materials and resources).
• Support the development of the functional economy and the sharing of goods and services
in the market and non-market sectors (e.g. Community-supported agriculture, equipment
sharing, remote working), with the help of new digital technologies.
• Implement and expand the voluntary system of environmental declarations for consumer
products and services, increasing the profile of existing schemes (energy labels, European
ecolabels etc.) to help consumers make low-carbon purchasing decisions.
• Inform and education individuals about the 'new generation' of practices and technologies
for saving energy at home (home automation, new lighting and heating technologies etc.).
• Encourage the installation of customised energy systems, intelligent energy control
technologies and automated services (businesses, local authorities, schools, individual
homes).
• Continue to develop and expand the network of Renovation Information Points, particularly
at inter-municipal level. Inform and educate users about dynamic management of smart
transport services.
• Encourage the use of new transport solutions (car-sharing, easy cycle hire schemes etc.).
• Step up research into incentive schemes to influence consumption and usage habits, taking
their results into account in campaigns to spread information and raise awareness of the
ecological transition.
48vii. Jobs, skills, qualifications and professional training
1. The energy transition, trades and skills
A. Knowledge
Our first priority must be to analyse our future requirements in terms of the sectors of activity,
professions and skills featuring in the national low-carbon strategy. This will require enhanced
cooperation between the national centre for professional development in the green economy
(piloted by the CGDD) and the Skills and Employment Network (REC, piloted by France Stratégie).
B. Professional Transitions
Our priorities must be to:
1. Create a new action strategy for employment, training and professional transitions linked to the
energy transition and green growth. This strategy will build upon the National Action Plan for
Employment and Careers in the Green Economy, the national debate on the energy transition and
the measures agreed upon at the environmental conferences in 2013 and 2014, as well as the
Multi-Annual Energy Plan and its assessment of our skill requirements and the way they are met
(or not) by existing training resources.
2. Encourage the introduction of regional management strategies for jobs and skills (GTEC), with
particular reference to the report 'Proposals for national training priorities in connection with the
ecological transition, and recommendations for future CPRDFOP plans' (regional strategies for the
development of training and professional orientation) published by the National Council for Life-
Long Learning (CNFPTLV):
• Identifying key skills allowing for career changes
• Supporting the grass-roots appropriation of methodological tools designed to facilitate
professional transition in areas affected by the ecological transition and energy efficiency
measures.
3. Improve the system of interprofessional qualification certificates (CQPI) for employees, in order
to facilitate professional mobility.
4. Improve orientation advice and training available to job-seekers, preparing them for the jobs
created by the ecological transition (with the support of the Pôle Emploi 2020 strategy).
2.  Energy transition, full-time and life-long professional training
We will encourage the inclusion of environment and climate modules in the school curriculum and
further training courses, tailoring our educational actions to the demands of the ecological and
energy transition: 
Our priorities must be to:
• Ensure that the stakes of climate change and the energy transition feature more prominently in
technological and professional training courses in schools and universities, in particular:
◦ continuing to incorporate the key techniques and skills of the energy and ecological
transition into the curriculum guidelines applied in our schools and universities
◦ continuing to update the curriculum and degree system operated by the ministry for
agriculture, in line with the "new approach to food production" action plan for education
which forms part of France's agro-ecological strategy. The purpose of this update is to
integrate agro-environmental practices which will help to reduce emissions from the
agricultural sector (maximising the use of organic fertilisers and additives, agro-forestry,
49prioritising grazing, increasing production of legumes and protein-rich plants etc.);
◦ adapting the initial and further training provided to architects, equipping them for the
changes induced by the energy transition and the return of natural resources to urban
areas.
• Rely on innovation to facilitate access to training:
◦ with innovative tools and methods (e-learning, MOOCs etc.)
◦ providing tools for craftspeople, micro-businesses and small companies (SMEs), taking
their specific requirements into account (e.g. the replacement system introduced in the
agricultural sector)
• Improve knowledge transfer involving professionals:
◦ training the trainers
◦ creating spaces where stakeholders from the real economy, research and education
can meet, such as clusters and competitiveness centres (sharing methods and
profession/skill   analyses)   for   all   sectors  of   the   economy  (particularly  industry,
construction, transport and agriculture)
• Develop targeted actions with the voluntary sector, in particular:
◦ Sector-specific action plans, with particular emphasis on support for professional
conversion.
◦ This is particularly important in jobs related to transport and mobility, where we must
work to integrate new 'green' skills and update the findings of the Transport committee.
◦ Boost the professional skills and reputation of the energy audit sector.
◦ Support technology transfer initiatives in the wood-forestry sector.
◦ Promote, on a broader level, awareness, information and training for employers and
employees, particularly in small businesses, including actions to boost employability
and the range of professional training on offer. This will include educating entrepreneurs
about the high stakes of the energy transition, and encouraging them to adopt
consulting, support and training services designed to boost eco-compatible skills in
small businesses.
◦ Create the conditions required to nurture the development of a new range of
engineering, consultancy and educational services accessible throughout the nation
(including in overseas territories), focusing on boosting employment, developing skills
and increasing awareness of the stakes at hand and the actions to be taken to
construct a low-carbon economy.
◦ Look closely at the connection between digital skills and the jobs created by the energy
transition, in order to plan ahead for training requirements.
◦ Assigning a clear status to professional qualifications (degrees, diplomas etc.) in
sectors impacted by the energy transition and the green economy in general.
50 viii .   Territorial implementation
1. Current state of affairs and carbon challenges
France already has considerable experience of climate action at local level, with Regional Air-
Climate-Energy Strategies and Local Energy-Climate Plans. Our regions and local authorities have
demonstrated considerable ambition, working in synergy with France's objectives and obligations
at the European and international levels. They are involved with countless concrete projects, while
also overseeing the cross-cutting implementation of the different sector-specific measures (town
planning and energy, town planning and transport) and providing the connection between the
different stakeholders involved (other local authorities, businesses, households etc.).
They have made a significant contribution to the national debate on the energy transition,
identifying areas for improvement and highlighting the importance of reforming the scope of
regional climate-energy plans to ensure that all areas of the country are covered by one plan and
one plan only. Discussions have also focused on the need to provide local authorities with greater
access to energy data, enabling them to construct energy policies consistent with the challenges
facing their territory.
2. Strategy (2030, 2050 and beyond)
2.1 Continuing to devolve power to the regions, clarifying responsibilities at every level. :
◦ The Law Introducing France's New Regional System (NOTRe) hands more power to
the regions in matters of climate change, air quality and energy.
◦ The Energy Transition and Green Growth Act requires all inter-municipal authorities
representing over 20,000 residents to produce Local Climate-Air-Energy Strategies
(PCAET), which must include air quality measures where relevant, particularly in areas
covered by atmospheric protection plans.
◦ In calls for tender, financial incentives should be used to support the most ambitious
regions (e.g. 'positive-energy territories for green growth' and 'zero-waste, zero-refuse
territories').
◦ Regional and local stakeholders have a decisive role to play in implementing this
strategy. They should be heavily involved with its next update, due for publication in
June 2019.
In the long term, the majority of the country should be covered by PCAET strategies. Above
and beyond immediate local concerns, these PCAET plans must include a short, medium and
long-term vision for the territory, consistent with national and regional strategies.
Effective implementation of these PCAET plans will require us to:
• improve the governance of inter-municipal authorities and encourage the development of
'greenhouse-gas neutral territories' and other such programmes;
• work to create more energy-positive territories (TEPCV), producing more energy than
they consume;
• expand local authorities' access to energy data (particularly relating to gas, electricity, heat
and oil products), allowing the regional observatories to produce more effective regional
greenhouse gas emission accounts and break them down at inter-municipal level, making it
easier to draft and implement PCAET plans;
• increase the capacity of local bodies to take 'Scope 3' criteria (i.e. indirect or induced
emissions and not just direct emissions) into account in their greenhouse gas emission
accounts (BEGES). In rural areas, the reductions in emissions made possible by the
production of bio-based resources could thus be taken into account.
51Further regulatory tools will allow local authorities to refine their GHG emission reduction policies.
All towns with over 50,000 residents must produce three-yearly reports showing the GHG
emissions falling within the scope of their responsibility. These accounts should be accompanied
by action plans setting out the measures the local authority plans to take to reduce these
emissions.
2.2 Harmonising, in a progressive and iterative manner, the consistency of the quantitative
objectives set at different scales
◦ Regional Development, Sustainable Governance and Territorial Equality Schemes
(SRADDET, superseding the current Regional Climate-Air-Energy Strategies) will be
drawn up by the Regions in cooperation with the local authorities falling within their
remit. The purpose of these plans is to define the region's strategic orientations and
medium-to-long-term objectives with regard to climate change and related issues, in
accordance with the national objectives.
◦ Territorial Air-Energy-Climate Plans (PCAET) and local planning regulations must take
these principles and objectives into account, and remain consistent with the regional
implementation measures involved.
◦ For PCAET published before the SRADDET, this harmonisation will occur during the
first revision process following approval of the SRADDET. All PCAET plans must be
made compatible with corresponding SRADDET measures within a maximum of three
years following their approval. It is worth noting that the SRADDET strategies include a
'biomass' section designed to help regions effectively manage their bio-based
resources, and to use them in a way which optimises emissions.
2.3  Providing effective management tools at every level. In addition to the regulatory
obligations it entails, the Energy Transition and Green Growth Act provides local authorities with
a number of tools and opportunities to implement consistent territorial policies to reduce emissions:
◦ In the construction sector, the creation of energy renovation platforms and third-party
financing schemes should serve to greatly increase the number of energy-efficiency
renovation projects.
◦ In the transport sector, the obligation for public bodies to replace old vehicles with new,
greener alternatives, the development of a charging infrastructure for electric cars and
the option given to mayors of restricting traffic or limiting speeds are all examples of
concrete actions which will yield results in the short term.
◦ In the renewable energy sector, inviting local authorities and residents to invest in
energy production companies should help to accelerate the transition towards less
carbonised forms of energy.
3. Coordinating the national low-carbon strategy with other plans and programmes
The strategy will be coordinated with: 
◦ Regional Development, Sustainable Governance and Territorial Equality Schemes
(SRADDET, superseding the Current Regional Climate-Air-Energy Strategies) are
necessarily closely linked to the
◦ existing Territorial Climate-Air-Energy Plans (PCAET). This link may be indirect, if the
SRADDET already incorporates the provisions of the national strategy.
◦ Other planning and scheduling documents produced by local authorities and their
agencies which also have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. This link
may also be indirect if the SRADDET or PCAET already incorporate the provisions of
the national strategy.
524. Special circumstances in the Overseas Departments, Corsica and the Ile-
de-France region
In the Overseas Departments, the Regional Climate-Air-Energy Plan will be incorporated into the
regional development strategy drawn up by the Region.
In Corsica and Île-de-France, the Regional Climate-Air-Energy Plan will be drawn up under the
same conditions as the PADDUC and SDRIF strategies.
5. Monitoring-evaluation and indicators
Indicators for this plan:
• percentage of towns with over 50,000 residents who have finalised their climate-air-energy
plan by 31 December 2016,
• percentage of towns with over 20,000 residents following suit by 31 December 2018.

Greenhouse gas emissions from domestic transport (127 Mt, 27% of France's total emissions)
increased by 20% between 1990 and 2004, falling between 2004 and 2013 to reach a total figure
12% greater than the 1990 level.
Key factors determining emissions from the transport sector:
• Two exogenous factors contributed to the increase in demand for transport: population (and
its structure), and the growth of Gross Domestic Product.
• In order to reduce emissions from transport, modal transfer in favour of less carbon-heavy
forms of transport (primarily rail) and a higher rate of occupancy are two key measures
which can help to drive down GHG emissions from our roads. However, these actions alone
will only be enough to stabilise emissions from the transport sector.
54• Greater energy efficiency and reductions in the carbon intensity of energy sources used for
transportation will account for the majority of GHG reductions. By 2050, a combination of
highly-effective technological solutions should be widely available and utilised. They will
include vehicles capable of travelling 100km on 2 litres of fuel, electric vehicles running on
virtually carbon-free electricity, low-carbon fuels (liquid or gas, including third-generation
biofuels and methanation systems) etc.
• The current inertia of the transport sector means that we are obliged to plan ahead for the
2050 time-frame, including measures which will not have a significant impact on emissions
until after 2030, even if it is still a little premature to attempt to predict their market share.
Take for example the advent of vehicles doing 100km to 2 litres of fuel:  for this technology
to be widespread by 2050 it will need to be included in the majority of vehicles sold from
2030 onwards. As for electric vehicles and new fuel sources, the creation of new recharging
and refuelling infrastructure networks will be essential. The challenge we face in the
present is to facilitate and prepare for these future developments.
Key messages:
At national level (including Overseas Departments):
• The 'Trajectory Committee' (2012),22 estimates that the contribution of the transport sector
to the national Factor 4 targets will need to be equivalent to a 65% reduction in greenhouse
gas emissions between 1990 and 2050.
• Within the time-frame of the 2023-2028 carbon budget, the guideline reduction target of
22% on 1990 levels is consistent with the aforementioned 2050 objective, in that it takes
into account the significant effort which will be required to diversify the energy mix in the
transport sector (still dominated by liquid fuels). We will need to develop alternative power
sources and charging infrastructure (electricity points, gas stations etc.) to make a much
bigger impact by 2050 than that which we expect to see in the next few carbon budgets.
• This target is based on a certain number of hypotheses regarding mobility, occupancy rate
and load rate of vehicles, energy efficiency, carbon intensity of fuels and the development
of modal transfers. These hypotheses are designed to represent the expected impact of
government policy. The main hypotheses, covering the period to 2030, correspond to the
five major action priorities detailed in the reference scenario in Chapter 2.2. The details
given in the paragraph 'Scope of the Reference Scenario' are of particular relevance to
transport.
Internationally:
• Emissions from air and maritime transport should not be neglected, especially as they are
likely to increase.
2. Strategy (2030 and 2050)
At the domestic level, the policy for reducing the climate impact of the transport sector will require
coordinated action on the following five fronts:
A. Controlling or reducing demand for transport (per capita and per unit of GDP) diminution
• The continuation of past trends would lead to a further increase in demand.
Increasing income would thus outstrip the impact of population ageing (with
regard to individual mobility), and the increase observed in the average distance
travelled per unit of GDP could be bolstered by the stabilisation or even growth
of industry as a proportion of GDP, contributing to the dynamic development of

Centre for Strategic Analysis, Trajectory Committee (2012). Trajectories for 2020-2050: towards a low-carbon
economy. Report of the Committee chaired by C.  Perthuis. Available at: http://archives.strategie.gouv.fr/cas/content/tra-
jectoires-2020-2050-vers-une-economie-sobre-en-carbone-rapport.html
55freight transportation included in the forecast scenarios.
• In order to achieve our long-term goal of stabilising mobility demand and
transport intensity at their current level, town planning and the development of
the circular economy and local distribution circuits (reducing the distance
between the place of production and place of consumption) will play a crucial
role.
• The development of remote working (and other concrete measures, particularly
via companies' transport strategies and collective agreements) and remote
services could also help stabilise per capita travel in the short term.
B. Load/occupancy rate of vehicles, and generally more efficient use of existing vehicles
and networks:
• there is great potential for improvement simply by making better use of the free
space in the vehicles currently on our roads. The rise of car-sharing and other
alternative mobility services will be of great importance for passenger vehicles.
Haulage firms can also do much to improve the load factor of freight cargoes.
The reference scenario predicts an increase of approximately 10% in the load
rate of HGVs and passenger vehicles between 2013 and the conclusion of the
third carbon budget. Furthermore, reducing maximum speeds on intercity roads
and motorways can also have a positive impact on reducing greenhouse gas
emissions.
C. Energy efficiency of vehicles
• The target of 100km to 2 litres of fuel should be a general standard for all cars by
2050, and for all new vehicles by 2030 at the latest. An intermediary objective still
needs to be set for the second carbon budget. This applies to individual vehicles,
with respect for the environmental relevance (including grey energy from vehicles
via life cycle analyses) and economic viability of each type of technology. It should
also be possible to improve the energy efficiency of HGVs, and objectives will need
to be set. The European scale appears to be the appropriate level for managing
these developments.  In terms of the overall energy efficiency of vehicles, the
reference scenario predicts an improvement of around 20% for the unitary
consumption of freight transport, and almost 30% for passenger transport between
2013 and the conclusion of the third carbon budget.
D. Carbon intensity of fuels
• research and development into decarbonised energy sources should open up
new solutions not currently advanced enough to be featured on a significant
scale in the carbon budgets (including but not limited to: 3rd-generation biofuels,
increasing the autonomy and charging speed of car batteries, hydrogen power,
bio-gas or methanation of hydrogen during the peak production periods of
intermittent renewable energy sources etc.).
• in the short-to-medium term, the government will support the diversification of
the energy mix in the transport sector, across all modes of transportation. This
will mean promoting electric vehicles, biofuels (particularly 2nd-generation
options, stabilising the proportion of conventional biofuels used for transport and
not food at the current level), natural gas (as a stepping stone to bio-gas) and
bio-gas. The reference scenario is based on a 6% improvement in the carbon
intensity of the energy sources used between 2013 and the conclusion of the
third carbon budget.
56E. Modal transfer 
• The aim here is to develop the transport modes and solutions which are most suited
to the environmental, climatic and economic conditions of each territory. In dense
urban areas, 'soft' transportation (walking, cycling) and collective public transport
should take priority. For long-distance freight transportation (over 500km or so), as
well as for other consignments whose size and flow characteristics make it possible
to use bulk transportation methods, priority should be afforded to rail and river
transport. River transport may also be useful for journeys of under 500km,
connecting industrial sites or cities. The development of these bulk transport options
should provide the industrial sector with a more competitive range of potential
transport solutions. Stronger inter-modal connections represent a key strategic
priority in this respect. We need to improve the services on offer, and this may
require increased investment in infrastructure offering an alternative to road
transportation. The reference scenario predicts that road and domestic air travel will
fall by 2% as a proportion of all motorised transport for passengers, and 7% for
freight transportation. The difference will be made up by other modes, particularly
rail, between 2013 and the conclusion of the third carbon budget.
• Fiscal tools, guided by the price signal, allow us to influence the behaviour of
individuals. The Domestic Tax on Energy Products (TICPE) includes a component
based on the carbon content of fuels. This charge is set to grow over time. This
cross-cutting instrument has the advantage of affecting all of the areas listed above.
The current, legally-defined trajectory of €22 in 2016, €56 in 2020 and €100 in 2030
(2015 euros) gives people time to plan ahead and adjust their investment decisions
accordingly (particularly when buying vehicles).
• Internationally, one priority is to establish globally-applicable rules via the IMO or
ICAO, to effectively implement these rules in all Member States and ensure fair
competition at the international level. It may be necessary to supplement these
measures with specific regional initiatives, in spite of the difficulties involved (e.g.
including the aviation sector in Europe's carbon market, promoting the use of
alternative fuels for maritime transport etc.). This is especially true since initiatives
taken by France or the European Union in this sector can serve to catalyse action at
international level. However, our work must remain consistent with the global
dynamic in order to avoid distorting competition in a manner which would put
European operators (some of whose business is 90% international) at unfair risk.
Points to be watched closely:
• Bringing forward the development of refuelling infrastructure (electric vehicle charge
points, gas stations) and coordination of all parties involved in their deployment
(government, local authorities, public agencies, businesses, households etc.).
• Coordinating the development of different sectors in order to optimise their
economic and environmental performance (joint benefits in terms of reducing
atmospheric pollution), incorporating medium and long-term considerations and
identifying the most effective means of pursuing our five priorities.
• Calibrating bio-based production chains and coordinating their connections with
resources and capacities from partner chains. Sustainability of these chains.
• Ensuring that companies get on board with these objectives and seize the
opportunities offered by the development of new industrial chains and service
activities, creating new jobs.
• Special attention should be paid to the road freight sector, where margins are
already tight and the market is shared between many small operators.
57• Fighting to reduce energy poverty and combat the isolation of rural areas,
particularly when new fiscal measures are introduced.
• Supporting rural territories - which could be fertile ground for new, alternative
mobility services - in order to make the energy transition a positive, galvanising
force in these areas.
• increasing the use of life-cycle analysis for transport projects.
• Regular evaluation of the measures taken to implement these principles in the
transport sector.
3. Coordinating the national low-carbon strategy with the plans and 
programmes developed for the transport sector
At the national level, the following objectives will be taken into account:
• in the Multi-Annual Energy Plans (compatibility stipulated in the Energy Transition and
Green Growth Act [LTECV])
• in the national strategy for the development of green mobility. This strategy sets out the
national action plan for developing the alternative fuel market and creating the necessary
infrastructure for these solutions to grow and thrive (Directive 2014/94 on refuelling
infrastructure).
• in the investment programmes for transport infrastructure.
At territorial level, these objectives will be taken into account in:
• regulatory planning documents such as: Territorial Cohesion Plans (SCOT), Urban
Transport   Plans   (PDU),   Inter-Municipal   Local   Development   Plans   Incorporating
Transportation (PLUi-D), Territorial Climate-Air-Energy Plans (PCAET);
• other planning documents: agreements made between competent authorities (e.g.
guideline   agreements),   company   travel   strategies,   inter-company   agreements,
administrative strategies etc.
• Regional Inter-Modal Development Plans, introduced by the Law on the Modernisation of
Local Government and the Creation of Metropolitan Areas, which may be coordinated with
the Rural Mobility Plans mentioned in the LTECV.
• The development of car-sharing facilities, as mentioned in the LTECV.
4. Special circumstances in the Overseas Departments
In terms of transporting goods, the development of the circular economy and short distribution
circuits (for example bringing companies closer to the businesses whose products or waste they
use) is a priority for cutting transport distances. The development of short circuits and local
production to meet local consumer demand is of particular importance in France's overseas
territories.
5. Monitoring-evaluation and indicators

• average daily distance travelled per person

59ii. Residential / Tertiary
1. Current state of affairs and carbon challenges
Direct emissions from the residential-tertiary sector account for around 20% of France's total
greenhouse gas emissions (cf. diagram below, Scope 1 emissions – in blue).23  Since the turn of
the millennium, in spite of an increase in the total population and heated surface area, emissions
from fuel combustion have decreased slightly. If energy efficiency measures had not been
introduced in the construction sector, these emissions would have increased sharply.
Overall emissions from this sector remain generally stable, given the increase in emissions derived
from the use of fluorinated gases (for air conditioning). The latter should be brought under control
by the European F-Gas regulations.
As well as direct emissions from buildings, there are also indirect emissions from energy
production (energy and heat) (cf. Scope 2 emissions, in green on the diagram).24 Taking these
indirect emissions into consideration, the sector accounts for around a quarter of all French
emissions. This total includes specific electricity consumption,25 which represents only 18% of
energy consumption in this sector, and less than 10% of greenhouse gas emissions, but has
nonetheless increased by 150% in 20 years. 
These emissions need to be set against those connected with the construction (and destruction) of
buildings (cf. diagram, Scope 3 emissions shown in pink). While the latter account for just 10Mt of
CO e (equivalent to 2 - 3% of total French emissions), in the future they will represent a growing
2
proportion of emissions from construction compared to emissions from the usage phase, across a
building's whole life cycle.  The steady increase in the proportion of GHG emissions from
construction as compared to the usage phase (c. 50% for buildings built to RT2012 standards)
requires us to adopt a whole life cycle approach to new buildings because, in 2050, buildings built
after 2013 will account for almost 40% of total structures. This means that controlling the energy
and environmental performance of new buildings is crucial to reducing our long-term impact on the
climate.
Given that heating still accounts for a major share of energy consumption in this sector, and that
energy performance requirements for new buildings have been greatly increased, energy used to
heat existing buildings offers the most promising opportunity to further reduce greenhouse gas
emissions from this sector (a big rise in serious renovation work is a key priority).  
23 Direct (or 'Scope 1' emissions): emissions linked to combustion for energy purposes in buildings (natural gas, oil,
liquefied petroleum gas and coal), use of fluorinated gases and solvents
24 These indirect (or Scope 2) emissions linked to energy production are, however, included in the sector's carbon
budgets for 'energy production'.
25 Specific electricity: the electricity required for services which can only be delivered by electrical energy (e.g. lighting
and electrical appliances).
60Sources of greenhouse gas emissions from the residential-tertiary sector
2. Strategy (2030 and 2050)
The Trajectory Committee (2012) calculated that reducing emissions from all sectors to a quarter of
their 1990 levels by 2050 would require an 85% reduction in direct emissions from the residential-
tertiary sector. The target of cutting direct emissions from the residential-tertiary sector in half
within the time-frame of the third carbon budget is consistent with reaching this long-term objective.
2.1. Reducing energy demand from the construction sector (Scopes 1 and 2)
The goal is for all existing buildings to be renovated to 'low-consumption building' standard by
2050. The reference scenario also requires renovation of the most energy-inefficient private homes
(energy class F or worse) by the end of the third carbon budget.
a. For all buildings:
• Cutting down consumption by changing user habits and minimising specific electricity usage,
with information and communication campaigns on energy-saving techniques as well as the
use of price signals (individual heating bills in buildings where this is not already the norm,
carbon tax added to energy prices etc.); The reference scenario forecasts a 4% reduction in
specific electricity consumption within the time-frame of the 3rd carbon budget, based on the
AMS2 projection.
b. For existing buildings:
We will need to take action on the following issues:
61• Large-scale energy renovation of existing residential and tertiary buildings, focusing on
thermal insulation, systems efficiency (heating, cooling, hot water, ventilation etc.).
Reducing energy consumption in the  residential-tertiary sector by 28%  by 2030 (with
reference to 2010 levels -  this is the reduction forecast by the reference scenario) will
require major renovations to 500,000 homes per year from 2017 onwards, with a target of
reducing the energy used to heat buildings built before 2010 by more than 40% by the end
of the period covered by the 3rd carbon budget.
• When replacing old heating systems, we need to encourage homeowners to avoid the most
carbon-heavy solutions, i.e. those with average annual emissions of over 300gCO /kWh26
2
of usable energy. This corresponds to the current average emissions from coal-only or oil-
only heating. Users will be encouraged to switch to options which generate less GHG,
particularly renewable energy sources.   The reference scenario forecasts that heating
systems with emissions greater than 300gCO /kWh will fall to below 4% as a proportion of
2
total energy consumption in the residential-tertiary sector by the end of the third carbon
budget.
c. For new buildings:
• New buildings must be designed to reduce GHG emissions, with life cycle analysis,
enhanced   energy   performance   targets   (BEPOS)   and   widespread   use   of
renewables. Effective implementation of these measures should allow us to meet our
energy objectives.
2.2 Reducing "grey"/Scope 3 emissions from buildings
This is a major priority both for renovation work and new-builds. We will need to:
• implement   standards   which   take   environmental   impact   into   account,   particularly
greenhouse gas emissions, with life cycle analysis. The next update to thermal regulations
for construction will include greenhouse gas emissions requirements, covering both the
usage and building phases. Using bio-based materials is one example of a pertinent
solution which can help reduce emissions and waste from construction and renovation. Bio-
materials allow us to increase the amount of atmospheric carbon captured and stored by
plants, and replace materials whose manufacturing processes generate GHG emissions.
The can also be developed locally. (cf. § 3.3.iv forestry-biomass).
2.3 Implementing these objectives
These action priorities can be broken down into measures applying to new buildings and existing
structures:
a. Helping project developers to improve their energy efficiency and reduce emissions from their
buildings
• Promoting simple actions to reduce consumption and emissions (including pro-active
management of consumption), supporting initiatives which encourage citizens to adopt
green practices via information and communication campaigns.
• Incentivising   households   to   perform   environmentally-friendly   energy   renovations,
developing public services in favour of energy performance via territorial platforms for
energy renovation and the roll-out of the Energy Renovation Passport.
• Incentivising the owners of tertiary-sector facilities, particularly smaller businesses, to adopt
an investment strategy based on improving energy performance and reducing emissions
b. Removing barriers to investment
26 This figure for combustion emissions per unit of energy used in domestic heating will be revised downwards over time.
It depends not only the carbon component of the energy sources used, but also the performance of heating systems.
62• Supporting energy renovation for low-income households, a major priority in the fight
against energy poverty
• Creating an array of additional incentives which are simple, coherent and stable in the long
term
• Motivating the financial sector to come up with dedicated instruments (such as third-party
financing solutions)
• Creating and deploying a guarantee fund for the energy transition
• Establishing long-term incentives for the social housing sector
• Making use of price signals (individual heating bills, carbon taxes incorporated into energy
prices etc.).
c. Tightening the regulatory requirements for the energy performance of buildings, based on their
technical and financial capacities:
• Planning ahead and publicising future regulatory requirements, with the use of quality
labels and voluntary schemes
 Making the reduction of GHG emissions a key component of future regulations for new
buildings, with life cycle analysis, enhanced energy performance targets (BEPOS) and
widespread use of renewable energies at the appropriate scale.
 For new buildings, analysing all forms of environmental impact by making life cycle analysis
a requirement for the design phase
 Revising the thermal regulations for existing buildings, increasing the performance
requirements and taking recent innovations into account
 Expanding the scope of application of these regulations, with an obligation to include
energy performance at every stage of a building's life cycle, along with compulsory
renovations for tertiary-sector facilities
d. Professional skills for a low-carbon economy
• Developing local chains devoted to the production and installation of low-carbon
construction and renovation materials, particularly bio-based materials such as wood.
• Developing recycling activities for the materials and waste generated by construction, in
line with life cycle analyses and in coordination with the national waste strategies.
• Encouraging professional training bodies to take a leading role in order to win the trust of
commissioning clients and ensure the quality of the work done.  
• Supporting training initiatives and labels, ensuring the consistency of the various actions
conducted at national and local level
• Developing comprehensive renovation packages covering all technical, legal and financial
aspects of projects for greater pertinence, quality and cost-efficiency.
• Ensuring that public-sector projects are exemplary, leading the way and helping to develop
skills levels in the sector
 e. Getting specific electricity consumption under control
• European directives on specific electricity consumption (ecodesign and labelling) allow
consumers to rapidly identify the least efficient products
• We need to further increase the information available to consumers, with campaigns
focusing on hidden consumption, websites highlighting inefficient devices, connected
electricity meters (Linky) etc.
• In the tertiary sector, we need to promote active energy efficiency and minimise the use of
air conditioning.  
f. Expanding knowledge and supporting research and innovation (cf. support for research and
development, Chap. 3.2.iii)
• Identifying different forms of energy usage and the reasons they change, in order to better
63appreciate the gap between theoretical and observed consumption
• Supporting the deployment of new innovations, with ambitious initiatives such as the
PREBAT scheme (life-size experiments) and the Future Investment programme.
• Rolling out a new asbestos treatment strategy - currently an obstacle to energy renovations
- and a new plan on the digital transition for the construction sector.
Points to be watched closely:
• The massification of major renovation work will need to be monitored carefully. The
availability of funding and the publication calendar for the government decree on tertiary
renovation will require particular attention. We must also ensure that the support systems in
place effectively reach their targets (financial instruments and advice/information services).
• While tightening up standards may be a structurally effective way of reaching our
objectives, these standards must be backed up by additional instruments (technical
efficiency checks, information, education, steering tools, pricing systems, obligations etc.)
to reduce real consumption and minimise the rebound effect (heating temperatures, air
conditioning, specific electricity use).
• The use of life cycle analysis is a key strategic measure which must be introduced in an
educational, informative manner.
3. Coordinating the national low-carbon strategy with the plans and programmes developed
for this sector
The priorities listed above must be taken into account in the following documents:
• The National Investment Strategy (designed to reduce energy consumption in private and
public office buildings and homes, stretching until 2050 with revisions every 5 years): this
strategy will include an action plan for targeted investments, based on technical and
economic analyses of renovation opportunities and techniques.
• The list of research programmes to be developed under the PREBAT scheme.
• The National Biomass Strategy
• The Action Plan for Building Quality and the Energy Transition (PACTE) 
• The digital transition strategy for the construction sector
• The R&D strategy for asbestos removal techniques, removing obstacles to major energy
renovations
4. Special circumstances in Overseas Departments and regions
In France's five Overseas Departments and Territories, the residential-tertiary sector has an even
more central role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions than it does on the mainland, on
account of the heavy carbon dependency of the energy and electricity supplies.  Electricity
consumption is growing much more rapidly than it is in France (3 - 4% annually), with the bulk of
production comprised of fossil fuels and other carbon-rich energy sources.
The actions to be taken will focus on reducing indirect emissions by cutting down on electricity
consumption, specifically by limiting the use of air conditioning, since emissions from heating are
virtually nil. Work is needed to protect buildings from sunlight, but also to increase the use of
renewable energy sources in buildings and city blocks (solar heating for hot water, geothermal
energy, heating and cooling networks etc.).
The recommendations listed above may be applied in the overseas territories, but some of them
will need to be tailored and adapted to the local economic circumstances and climate.  
1. To begin with, we will need a more detailed overview of the state of existing buildings and
the potential energy saving opportunities they offer. In this way, we can develop initiatives
tailored to the situation on the ground;
642. The thermal, acoustic and ventilation regulations applicable to new homes since 1st May
2010 (RTAA DOM) were designed to bring energy consumption under control, making
buildings more comfortable in warm weather in order to reduce the need for air
conditioning. We must look at the possibility of expanding the RTAA to create more
comprehensive performance regulations, with more room for innovation and actions which
apply to the tertiary sector and existing buildings. Voluntary environmental schemes are
also to be encouraged;
3. In terms of energy renovations, financial incentives must take into account the specific
climate conditions of the Overseas Departments from the outset. Energy renovations for
social housing will be a major step towards the widespread improvement of heat
management in homes.
4. Energy-efficiency training allowing professionals to obtain the RGE certificate will need to
be adapted to the conditions of the Overseas Departments.
5. As in Metropolitan France, the development of bio-based materials is a major priority.
Special attention should be paid to developing local production chains, creating permanent
jobs and reducing reliance on imports.
5. Monitoring-evaluation and indicators
• Result indicators:
o Energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the residential-
tertiary sector, by energy type, use and building type (residential/tertiary) (source
CEREN, ADEME)
o  Energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from the construction sector
(generated by construction and demolition) (indicator not currently available)
• Evaluation:
Monitoring renovation work - volume, type, efficiency - and the energy consumption of new
buildings are the major priorities, as energy-efficiency measures represent a sizeable and
structurally   important   component   of   the   present   strategy.  Attentive   monitoring   of
government policies will allow us to adjust them in response to developments observed
during their deployment.
While energy renovation requires substantial public and private investment, it has so far
proved impossible to effectively monitor the results generated by these investments
because the process is deemed to be too complex and costly. This is largely a result of the
huge variety of circumstances involved and the way data about private projects is scattered
across numerous sources. Using the technical data supplied under the Tax Credit for the
Energy Transition scheme could be one way of remedying this lack of visibility.
65iii. Agriculture
1. Current state of affairs and carbon challenges
o The global context: tensions, weaknesses, opportunities
Despite the numerous sources of uncertainty at the European and international levels, we can
identify several clear trends which will need to be taken into consideration in the future
development of the SNBC. As well as the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the
potential for capturing carbon in agricultural land and the task of adapting to climate change and its
effects, we must also take into consideration the question of food security and the specific
requirements of agriculture in the face of climate change.
A strong increase in demand for food and non-food products
The global context will open up major opportunities for agricultural operations, with a sharp
increase in demand for food and non-food products.
For example, combined analysis of the current estimates for demographic growth, economic
growth and the nutritional transition leads the FAO to predict a 60% increase in global agricultural
output by 2050. An even greater increase is predicted in livestock farming and plant oil production.
This increase in demand for food should be echoed by an increase in demand for non-food
products. These general trends conceal some genuine opportunities (rise of middle classes with a
greater interest in the quality of products) as well as areas of fragility (stubbornly high levels of
poverty which suggest that food security will not be an absolute certainty in 2050).
Vulnerability and tensions affecting resources
This necessary increase in agricultural output will come in a context of growing tensions over land
and water resources, as well as other strategic resources which are often unevenly distributed.
These multiple tensions will exacerbate existing weaknesses in the world's food systems, at a time
when environmental pressures (biodiversity, pollution of soils and water) are also increasingly
troublesome. Climate change will further aggravate these vulnerabilities, exacerbating tensions in
countries already struggling with problems of food security.
Impact of international trade on food system, and growing interdependence
Last but by no means least, the planet's food systems are becoming increasingly interdependent,
particularly via international trade and the liberalisation of markets for foodstuffs and non-edible
agricultural goods produced from agricultural raw materials. Moreover, many emerging nations will
soon come to play a more and more prominent role in a global market less and less dominated by
Europe and North America.
More than ever before, we will need to design our national agricultural strategy in this global
context. Carbon footprint and environmental impact are particularly pertinent indicators in this
sector, which need to be incorporated into a multi-criteria approach in order to offer a
comprehensive response to the many challenges facing the agricultural sector. At a more general
level, in order to adequately respond to the global array of challenges and interactions listed
above, carbon intensity is another key indicator.
o The national context
Current state of affairs
French agricultural production (excluding forestry and the food industry) accounted for 3.9% of
66GDP in 2013, and around 730,000 jobs.27 In 2013, total usable agricultural space covered 28.8
million hectares, or 52.5% of the total surface area of Metropolitan France (45.4% including
Overseas Departments). This land is planted primarily with arable crops and oil protein crops
(45.4%) and forage (49.6%), the latter accounting for 89% of grassland. France had the largest
number of cattle of any EU country in 2013, with 19.1 million head of cattle of which 3.7 million
were dairy cows and 4.1 sucklers.28
In France, the demographic forecasts drawn up by INSEE predict that the population will grow to
70 million by 2050, which may lead to an increase in demand for food. However, eating habits are
changing and per capita meat consumption has declined in recent years.
In the meantime, the sector will also have to deal with growing demand for non-food products for
use in energy production, green chemistry or bio-based materials.
But the primary obligation of the agricultural sector is to provide healthy food of good nutritional
quality. Bearing in mind that, generally speaking, people have high expectations with regard to the
quality of the food they eat as well as its origins, local production circuits, animal welfare, issues of
food security and the positive external effects of agriculture (environment, landscape etc.).
Breakdown of greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector
In 2013, greenhouse gas emissions from France's agricultural sector accounted for 21% of the
country's total man-made emissions, some 92.1 Mt of CO  (Kyoto format, CITEPA 2015). These
2
emissions fell by 6.2% between 1990 and 2013. 43% of these emissions are nitrous oxide (N O)
2
derived from nitrogen-based fertilisers and animal waste, along with 42% methane (CH ) produced
4
by enteric fermentation in grazing animals, the decomposition of animal excrement in anaerobic
conditions or the incomplete combustion of organic matter.29 Energy consumption on farms also
accounts for 12.6 MtCO  (CITEPA 2015).
2
Agricultural land also gives off CO  on account of the way it is used. These emissions were
2
estimated at 10 MtCO  for the year 2013 (CITEPA 2015, UNFCCC inventory).
2
Greenhouse gas emissions from this sector are, by definition, diffuse: they are the product of
500,000 farms covering some 29 million hectares.  They are the by-products of biological
processes which still require further research, with very high levels of uncertainty (as much as
200% regarding nitrous oxide emissions at national level) which cannot be entirely brought under
control. Furthermore, the mechanisms at play act in sometimes contradictory fashion when we take
into consideration the induced effects on direct emissions, yields, available produce, indirect
emissions, the environment etc.
These mechanisms, and indeed agriculture itself, are closely connected to the climate.
Finally, consumption connected to agricultural land leads indirectly to greater pressure on
remaining land, leading to the release of carbon, particularly when artificialisation is involved.
o Challenges facing the agricultural sector
High stakes for the agricultural sector, closely linked to the general context
Decisions taken in the agricultural sector must be coherent with the national effort to reduce GHG
emissions, while also satisfying a number of other criteria:
- guaranteeing food security;
- protecting public health, in terms of food quality and in terms of the effects of agricultural
practices on farmers;
27In 2012. Source: Agreste France, Mémento 2014
28Source: Agreste France, Mémento 2014
29Cattle accounted for 82% of total methane emissions from French farms in 2012
67- protecting the environment and natural resources, water, soils, air, biodiversity, preserving
the landscape and guaranteeing animal well-being on farms;
- protecting jobs and competitiveness (in the EU and internationally) for agricultural
businesses, which are often small, at a time of liberalisation in agricultural markets;
- helping these businesses to adapt to climate change;
- harmonious development of rural areas, protecting our gastronomic heritage;
- supporting the bioeconomy and maintaining the supply of non-food products (energy and
materials);
- fighting against the reduction of agricultural land.
Five major factors which shape these challenges
- farming systems and practices, which can vary greatly in terms of the GHG emissions
generated to produce a given quantity of agricultural goods;
- rural development and land use;
- the overall efficiency of the whole chain which delivers food to final consumers, with
countless opportunities to reduce waste and indirect emissions;
- dietary habits, which determine the nature of the demand placed on agriculture;
- techniques for adapting to climate change, allowing us to maintain or improve production
systems.
The importance of taking the risk of 'carbon leakage' into account
Fluctuations in final internal demand for food products need not necessarily lead to changes in
greenhouse gas emissions from the French agricultural sector. For example, we may instead see
outsourcing of production systems or an increase in exports (or a reduction of imports), both of
which will have knock-on effects on emissions outside the country. We must therefore take
emissions outside France into account when drawing up our carbon accounts.
All the more so since the risk of carbon leakage is very high in this competitive sector: if GHG
reduction measures were to reduce the competitive capacities of farms, the risk of production
going offshore is significant. The actual effect may thus be the opposite of that intended, as
producing food overseas can generate even more greenhouse gas emissions.
Synergy and opportunities from green growth  The low-carbon economy and the efforts
required to implement this strategy must also aim to boost growth and employment in all sectors,
including agriculture. Above and beyond the general boost to GDP, agriculture occupies a special
place in the green growth process and will be instrumental to the success of the SNBC. The sector
presents numerous opportunities in this respect: steering domestic demand towards local supply
chains with greater added value, nurturing demand for bio-based products for bio-materials, green
chemistry and energy products. The obstacles involved (economic, social and environmental) are
complex, but French agriculture is well-placed to overcome them in terms of the human,
technological and natural resources at its disposal. Maintaining and expanding the diversity of the
production system will help to foster the emergence of effective activities in all areas, including
initiatives to reduce carbon intensity.
1. Strategy: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing carbon capture with
the development of an environmentally-sustainable agricultural sector
The general direction outlined in Chapter 2 should be interpreted pragmatically and adapted to the
68circumstances of different economic sectors and, where applicable, regions.
It is on this scale that detailed assessment is required of the various joint benefits and impacts,
adopting a multi-functional approach. In this respect the national objectives are merely advisory.
Evaluation and analysis of the potential for progress at this level, part of the process of producing
action strategies for the agricultural sector, will allow us to more effectively measure the impact of
the SNBC ahead of its next revision (to come into force on 1st July 2019).
b. Steering agricultural production towards agro-ecology
Our primary objectives are to reduce N O emissions by reducing the use of nitrogen-based
2
fertilisers, to reduce CH  emissions by using animal effluents to produce energy and adapting the
4
feed given to grazing animals, to capture carbon in soils and biomass, and to replace fossil fuel
emissions with energy from biomass.
Enhanced implementation of the agro-ecology project
Meeting these objectives while also handling the challenges described above will require us to take
the predicted effects of current policies into consideration: CAP (greening and second pillar), the
end of milk quotas, more support for livestock farmers, the Organic Ambition strategy, the protein
strategy and the enhanced implementation of the agro-ecology project:
• optimisation of the nitrogen cycle, increase in low-input circuits and replacement of mineral
fertilisers with organic alternatives; reduction of the nitrogen surplus, particularly via the
development of low-input circuits and the optimisation of dosing and substitute treatments.
Average guideline target: -30UN mineral/ha (units of mineral nitrogen) in 2035 compared to
2010, for equivalent yield;
• increasing the duration of crop rotation periods, diversifying crops and planting more
legumes;
o Guideline target: more than 2M ha of legumes by 2035, of which 900,000 ha of
large protein-crop farms
• protecting permanent grassland;
o Guideline target: restricting the reduction in permanent grassland to 490,000 ha
between 2010 and 2035
• developing agro-forestry, hedgerows and other agro-ecological infrastructures;
o Guideline targets: 700,000 ha of hedgerows and 120,000 ha of agro-forests by
2035
• developing forms of arable and livestock farming with higher added value: organic
agriculture, quality labels, environmental certifications, other forms of accreditation, new
sales and distribution techniques etc.;
o Guideline target: 15% of arable UAA (25% of total UAA) to be converted to organic
agriculture by 2035.
• soil coverage and increasing the proportion of organic matter in our soils;
o Guideline target: catch crops accounting for 80% of spring crops by 2035
• moving towards protein autonomy and adjusting animal feed to more closely reflect their
protein requirements;
o Guideline targets: developing legume crops (see above) and reducing the protein
rations provided to over 50% of dairy cattle by 2035
• deployment of agricultural methanisation;
o Guideline target: 40% of usable excrement to be methanised;
• boosting farms' energy performance by making them more efficient (buildings, materials
and equipment) and replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources.
o Guideline target: 35% reduction in energy consumption by 2035, compared with
2010 levels
69Better tracking and valuation of the work done
We must improve our tracking of the GHG impact of agricultural practices, to ensure that it is
accurately reflected in the national emissions inventories. We also need to closely monitor the
economic impact of the changes we are promoting. We must also continue to recognise the value
of the work done in agriculture in terms of quality of produce and carbon storage.
Developing our bio-economy strategy
The measures included in the agro-ecology project aim to establish conditions conducive to the
development of the bioeconomy. The diversity of agricultural production and the promotion of agro-
forestry can help us to boost the economic performance of farms while also replacing fossil fuels
with more widespread use of biomass for energy and materials. The agricultural sector can also
help to supply the energy, materials and chemical sectors with biomass materials. This contribution
must not come at the expense of other purposes (particularly food production, which remains the
primary purpose of agriculture), nor upset the equilibrium of production systems. We must
therefore foster the development of efficient (economically and environmentally) supply systems
which allow us to make the best possible use of bio-resources. We thus need to encourage the
planting of intermediary crops, effective use of excess crops not required to maintain the
agronomic quality of the soil or for animal feed, as well as low-carbon crops and crops requiring
few inputs.
A guarantee of sustainable land management
The shrinkage of agricultural land must be stopped in the long term, and heavily reduced by 2035,
in line with the development recommendations for our regions and urban areas (cf. §2.3).
For agricultural land which has been temporarily abandoned, we will need to find innovative
solutions to ensure the sustainable management of resources and make use of their productive
potential in various ways (food, materials, energy, chemicals etc.).
Appendix 7 on land usage and the categorisation of land and forest resources (UTCATF) provides
further detail of their potential for carbon mitigation. This appendix also includes details of current
and planned policies and measures for the management of pastures and cultivated land, and their
impact.
a. Taking food production into consideration
Stepping up the fight against food waste
The fight against food waste is an important aspect of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and our
carbon footprint. Reducing food waste must be a top priority for public and private initiatives.
Developing local, seasonal distribution circuits
The development of local, seasonal distribution circuits will help us to reduce the environmental
impact of transporting food, promoting local agriculture and protecting jobs. We need to adopt a
comprehensive approach to analysing the benefits of such circuits. With regard to greenhouse gas
emissions from the transport sector, we must take care to include the impact of the final few
kilometres in the chain, which can be considerable. Information and education campaigns will be
required to convince consumers of the benefits of eating a diverse array of locally-sourced,
seasonal, high-quality foods (PDO, PGI).
Influence of eating habits on food production
Actions will be taken to promote a balanced, diverse diet. These actions may focus on the food
products supplied to collective canteens (in the public and private sectors), promoting seasonal,
local produce of certified quality and, where possible, organic status. This could have clear benefits
for agricultural producers. Promoting the nutritional values of legumes could also have a positive
impact. If livestock farming were to suffer as a result (which is not necessarily inevitable, given the
70potential for exports), the preferable solution would be to compensate for the lost volume with an
increase in quality. It is highly important that we protect the equilibrium and specific character of
our agricultural land by maintaining livestock farms which make effective use of pastures that also
act as carbon stores, while also reducing the need for mineral fertilisers thanks to the availability of
manure.
b. Planning ahead for combined effects with other sectors
Environmental issues in synergy with the climate challenges
Agro-ecological systems offer various shared benefits: protecting water quality, preserving
biodiversity, improving soil quality etc.
These factors help to increase the resilience of agricultural systems to climate change, which is
another important factor in protecting farms, employment and output.
In order to consolidate these gains, we will need to develop initiatives to better appreciate and
promote the environmental benefits of agriculture.
Land use
Fighting to stop the loss of farmland will necessarily have knock-on effects for urban development
and infrastructures, as well as forestry stocks. Stemming the artificialisation of land is a major
priority for the medium-to-long term, requiring strong leadership tools which must be developed in
greater detail when the present strategy is revised (cf. §3.2.iv).
The availability and many uses of biomass
The growing diversity of uses for agricultural products, from food to energy production via materials
of all sorts, makes it more important than ever to establish a firm understanding of the available
resources and the interactions between the various production chains.   We therefore need
observational tools which cover all forms of biomass resources (agricultural resources as well as
forestry, industrial and urban resources). In addition to soil fertilisation and animal feed, as much as
8 MtDM,30 of leftover agricultural produce could be available each year31 for non-food-related
purposes Special attention should be devoted to preserving and increasing the amount of carbon
stored in the soil.
Contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from other sectors
Reducing the use of nitrogen-based fertilisers will help to reduce the carbon footprint from food
production. In 2012, 50% of simple nitrogen-based fertilisers used in France were imported.
The use of combustibles from renewable sources instead of fossil fuels, and the use of bio-based
materials in lieu of more energy-intensive materials, can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
from other sectors (transport, housing, industry etc.). This contribution will be monitored, in order to
provide information on the contribution made by agriculture, in addition to reducing its greenhouse
gas emissions.
Boosting protein autonomy and protecting permanent grassland will also have an impact on the
production of livestock feed, in France and overseas.
c. Points to be watched closely
• When breaking this strategy down into sector-specific policies and plans (see next section),
we must be sure to take into consideration the constraints and opportunities connected with
reforms to the common agricultural policy.
• The concrete measures introduced to minimise land artificialisation will need to be
monitored closely, as this is a major concern for the sector.
• Special attention should also be devoted to analysing the results of multifunctional
30 : MtDM = Millions of tonnes of dry matter
31 : according to the National Agency for Biomass Resources (ONRB)
71assessments (economic, social, environmental) of the development strategies implemented
in each sector, focusing specifically on their efficiency in terms of emissions per unit of
value added.
• When analysing the feasibility of new measures, we will also need to bear in mind the
structure of farms (small businesses), as well as the investment capacity of agricultural
firms and the prevailing economic conditions in the different production chains.
• Finally, and even more so here than in other sectors, the two major components of climate
policy must be developed simultaneously in order to incorporate the challenges of adapting
to climate change into the measures adopted for each production chain.
1. Coordination with sectoral policies and plans
The existing framework of sectoral policies and plans provides scope for action
Implementing the agro-ecological project and its sub-strategies already allows for numerous forms
of action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The 2014-2020 CAP reform paved the way for more effective consideration of climate change and
greenhouse gas emissions, with both the 'greening' of the first pillar and the reinforcement of the
second pillar. The regionalisation of the second pillar has also opened up more room for
manoeuvre at territorial level, allowing us to tailor our actions to local requirements.
Last but not least, all sectoral plans for agriculture and food must incorporate targets for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions during their next update (Regional Rural Development Rural
Programme, Regional Climate-Air-Energy Plans, National Food Programme, regional food
projects, national health and nutrition programmes etc.).
See Appendix 7 for more details on current policies
The need to step up our efforts in order to meet our targets
These recent policies focus on the period up to 2020, and we will need to go much further in order
to hit our targets for 2050 by pushing for stricter requirements (in negotiations on the future of the
CAP, in order to avoid distorting competition at the European level), investing more in innovation,
training and information, exploiting opportunities for synergy between public policies and
encouraging experimentation by all stakeholders (government, local authorities, professional
bodies, NGOs etc.).
The government must promote technical innovation (in equipment and in terms of the precision of
agricultural practices) as well as institutional and organisational innovation, with new instruments
born of ground-level experiments and sharing of best practices.
Scientific research is expected to yield strategic breakthroughs, allowing us to develop economic
tools which recognise and promote the environmental and social contributions of agriculture. We
must aim to take the carbon content of agricultural produce into account (via life cycle analysis),
master the complex task of measuring emissions (in light of the numerous biological and cultural
phenomena involved) and produce suitable inventories and monitoring systems. Special attention
should be devoted to preserving and increasing the carbon content of our soils, supporting the new
initiative launched by the Minister for Agriculture ahead of the COP21 conference in December
2015: "4 for 1000: soils for food security and the climate." This initiative involves two major actions:
an international programme of scientific research and cooperation, and a coalition of stakeholders
committed to soil preservation.
A considerable amount of training and technical advice will be required to encourage the
identification, optimisation, deployment and spread of innovative agricultural techniques and
practices. Agricultural training must integrate these issues into its programmes from the outset, as
must farmers when planning for their future.
Finally, reorganising the chains upstream and downstream of farms could help with cost
abatement.
722. Monitoring-evaluation and indicators
The following indicators will be monitored,32 though some of them require further fine-tuning.
Dealing with nitrogen
 Existing indicators:
– use of nitrogen-based mineral fertilisers (compared with national nitrogen surplus);
– sales of mineral fertilisers, proportion of imports.
– legume cultivation;
• Indicators to be implemented or fine-tuned
– Factors determining emissions from the fertiliser industry, not necessarily the same in
France and elsewhere;
– Real N O emissions from nitrogen-based fertilisers in mineral and organic form, and
2
methanisation products
Reducing methane emissions
• Existing indicators:
• nutritional breakdown of animal feed
• Indicators to be implemented or fine-tuned
• quantities of animal effluent methanised;
Carbon capture in soils and biomass
• Existing indicators:
◦ surface area of permanent meadow land;
◦ surface area planted with catch crops;
• Indicators to be implemented or fine-tuned
◦ carbon capture in farm soils
◦ surface area devoted to agroforestry;
Reducing direct and indirect CO  emissions
2
• Existing indicators:
◦ energy consumption by agricultural operations;
• Indicators to be implemented or fine-tuned
◦ flows of non-forest biomass to materials and energy uses (MtDM/year) [broken down to
show major sources and outlets];
◦ rate of recycling in bio-based activities;
Cross-cutting indicators
◦ territorial emissions;
◦ indicator for the carbon intensity of agricultural production by unit of value added;
◦ surface area of artificialised land;
◦ national consumption of animal protein, plant protein and calories;
◦ measurements of food waste;
◦ surface area devoted to organic agriculture;
◦ assessment of the cross-cutting contribution of agriculture to attenuating climate
change (including substitution effects from bio-based activities - bioeconomy and bio-
energies).
32As agricultural activity is highly sensitive to variations in the climate and the economy, these indicators need to be
analysed in their proper context.
731. Special circumstances in the Overseas Departments
On a general level, the major priorities set out above will also apply in the Overseas Departments.
The transition to agro-ecological practices will be of particular importance in these territories.
One of the specific challenges facing France's overseas territories is their exposure to extreme
climate phenomena. We therefore need to develop our understanding of the predictable
consequences for agriculture. Protecting the soil is especially important, in light of the impact of
intense rain and the risk of erosion. In this respect, the preservation and planting of plant coverage
or agro-forests will allow us to protect soils and preserve or increase carbon stocks. Improving the
fertility of our soils will also allow us to reduce the pressure on wooded areas and reduce
artificialisation.
Food production is particularly important, especially on the islands (but also in Guiana), as
strengthening local agricultural circuits could lead to a huge decrease in reliance on imports. To
achieve this goal, we must strengthen collective organisation and activities in order to nurture the
development of local production.
Agriculture also makes a major contribution to the diversity of the energy mix, as sugar cane by-
products are used to power generators in some regions. Projects are also in place to increase the
methanisation of agro-industrial by-products (from rum distilleries and abattoirs).
These initiatives need to be supported, in order to develop a better understanding of the emissions
mechanisms at work in the major crops (research into banana cultivation is in progress, and a
similar project is scheduled for sugar cane). Little information is available for Mayotte and Guiana,
and strengthening local observatories would help us to better understand the phenomena at work
in these regions.
74iv. Forests - wood - biomass
1. Current state of affairs and carbon challenges
• The total surface area covered by forests in Metropolitan France has grown sharply
since the mid-19th century to stand at 16 Mha in 2014. The figure is believed to have been
approximately 9Mha in 1830. Wooded areas have expanded by 7Mha since 1900. Between
1980 and 2000, for example, the average annual increase was around 68,000 ha. This
expansion has been caused primarily by the natural colonisation of land no longer used for
agricultural purposes.
• France has the largest forestry resources in Western Europe in terms of its potential as a
'carbon pump',33 with gross annual biological growth of around 120 Mm  (total above-
3
ground wood volume). Meanwhile, current annual usage is only about 60 Mm3, more than
a third of which is firewood burned in private homes. Private forests are widely scattered
and widely underused. They account for 76% of the total surface area of forests in
Metropolitan France.
• Non-forest sources of biomass (other trees, by-products from the timber industry, short
rotation   coppice,   agricultural   biomass,   methanisable  substrates,   green   waste  etc.)
represent another major opportunity.
• In the long term, our focus will be on the following four areas:
1. substituting bio-based products for more energy-intensive materials,34 
2. unlocking the energy potential of bio-based products and waste products, which can
replace fossil fuels;35
3. carbon storage in wood and wood-based products;36 
4. carbon capture by the forest ecosystem;37
When combined, these measures should allow us to compensate for between 15 and 20%
of national emissions.
2. Strategy (2030, 2050 and beyond)
• We need to promote a multifunctional approach to forestry management, covering
economic aspects among other things. In the long term, we should aim to greatly increase
the amount of wood used annually and maximise the value added and efficiency of its
uses, particularly by using by-products and waste from bio-based activities to boost
recycling and energy production.
• Abandoned agricultural land needs to be sustainably managed, maximising its productive
potential with high-added-value activities.
• Management of other biomass resources needs to be strengthened and optimised.   
33Biological expansion, minus natural mortality.
34This allows us to cut down emissions from fossil fuels, and also opens up opportunities to reuse, recycle and optimise waste.
35In the long term this allows us to avoid burning fossil fuels, although in the short term the emissions from burning wood are greater
than those released by fossil alternatives. This phenomenon is known as 'carbon debt' (delayed positive effect for the climate) or 'carbon
investment' (immediate deduction), cf.
http://www.ademe.fr/sites/default/files/assets/documents/avis_ademe_foret-mitigation-cght-clim_vdef.pdf.
36This allows us to increase temporary stocks of artificial carbon, and thus to delay emissions.
37These stocks naturally fluctuate (but the volumes involved are substantial: biomass from plants and soils)
75In order to capitalise on all forms of biomass,38 while prioritising those uses which generate the
most value added, we will need to encourage the use of timber (and other bio-based products)
on a large scale in the construction sector, while developing the corresponding commercial and
industrial chains. Developing these chains is our first priority - the work must begin now, but
their development will necessarily be a long-term process. This ties in with our objective of
exploiting the energy potential of under-used resources from the timber industry (this objective
itself must be particularly sensitive to the needs of other sectors using biomass), in order to
limit our use of fossil fuels.
Achieving these two objectives will require:
• a five-fold increase in demand for bio-based products (particularly wood-based products)
and a production chain capable of meeting this demand. This is all part of a long-term and
highly promising project to increase the use of alternative materials, already under way but
in need of substantial reinforcement and support from public authorities and professional
organisations (investors, developers, project owners, contractors, R&D, regulations,
environmental performance labels etc.).
• more dynamic forestry management and regular renewal of forestry resources: managing
uncultivated land, converting coppice land (particularly low-quality areas, with replanting
where necessary),
• unification of small forest parcels (or at least their management),
• fiscal incentives for dynamic, sustainable resource management,
• efficient use of bio-based resources in industry, construction, interior design, packaging,
energy etc.
• close monitoring of the sustainability of the activities involved, particularly their impact on
biodiversity, soils, air, water and the landscape. All projects to develop the use of these
resources should meet superior environmental performance criteria.
• enhanced and shared monitoring of the flows of materials and economic data,
• a deeper understanding of the potential uses of biomass, including for energy purposes,
and the impacts on climate change of the development of energy optimisation efforts in the
short, medium and long term, in the context of French forestry resources.
3. Coordinating the national low-carbon strategy with the plans and programmes developed
for the forestry and biomass sector
The long-term stakes and objectives identified above must be taken into account when drafting or
revising the following documents:
• the  National Biomass Strategy and Regional Biomass Plans.  Beyond the major
strategic orientations set out above, the level of mobilisation to be used as a medium-term
objective is yet to be determined. It should be defined in this strategy and its accompanying
regional plans, taking into account the requirements of the Multiannual Energy Plan for the
period to 2023. The biomass strategy should specify the measures required to guarantee
the sustainability of the resources involved - including imports, where applicable - and
ensure the superior environmental quality of all activities involved, particularly in terms of
biodiversity.
• the National Bioeconomy Strategy
• the  National Programme for Wood and Forestry  (PNFB), broken down into
regional forest and wood programmes;
• the 'Wood Industries' strategy drawn up by Nouvelle France Industrielle;
• the  Wood Construction Techniques Action Plan,  including measures to promote
professional training, the rehabilitation of existing buildings (thermal insulation and
38Biomass from forests, farmland and trees outside of forests (roadsides, urban trees etc.), by-products of the wood industry (HHV
chips, black liquor etc.), short rotation coppice, agricultural biomass (straw, other by-products or residues, energy crops etc.), green
waste etc.
76expansion) and the use of hardwood timber in construction.
• the National Plan for Bio-Based Construction Materials, designed to support other
forms of construction with bio-based materials (excluding timber) .
• The National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (PNACC), taking into account the
close synergy between adaptation and mitigation, particularly for our forests;
• the Strategic Contract for the Wood Sector, spelling out the measures included in the
National Action Plan for the future of wood-based industries.
It will also be useful to take these factors into consideration in future budgets, since the fiscal
context is of great importance to the forestry sector and can provide the owners of forestry
resources with incentives to sustainably and actively manage this natural heritage. These include
tools such as the tax incentive for forestry investments (DEFI); the forestry investment and
insurance account (CIFA); the degressive rate of amortization for saws, production equipment and
treatment systems used by the wood industry; conditions attached to tax relief for forestry assets or
income; levying of the tax on unoccupied land and potential changes to the system; terms applying
to Forestry Economic and Environmental Interest Groups (GIEEF).
These considerations should also be taken into account when deciding how best to use the
Renewable Heat Fund managed by the ADEME.
4. Special circumstances in the Overseas Departments
The challenge of limiting deforestation while developing the wood industry
Production is thoroughly underdeveloped in the Overseas Departments (70,000 m³/year in Guiana
– equivalent to the output of a 10-15,000ha forest in Metropolitan France, 10,000 m³/year in
Reunion, a few m³/year in other departments), but the local timber industry provides jobs (3rd
largest sector of the economy in Guiana). The development potential of this sector is huge, in
terms of self-sufficiency in timber, construction materials and biomass as well as job creation, while
also preserving the environmental, social and protective/regulatory functions of forestry resources.
The scientific data currently available does not allow us to estimate the carbon sink potential of
forests in the Overseas Departments, so a conservative hypothesis of a neutral impact has been
used. However, figures are available for afforestation/deforestation, and Guiana and the Antilles
are net emitters.  Proportionally to the surface area of their forestry resources, they are France's
most heavily-emitting regions. The inventory submitted to the UNFCCC under the terms of the
Kyoto Protocol shows that deforestation in Guiana accounts for 15% of total deforestation (approx.
5000 ha/year), but over 45% of GHG emissions.
 
The main action priority in the Overseas Departments is afforestation/deforestation. Limiting
deforestation is a matter of more effectively managing authorised land clearing and strictly policing
illegal clearing (clandestine gold prospecting, agriculture and construction). We also need to
consider increasing reforestation efforts, including new planting programmes. This will depend on
the development of the local wood sector, both to provide wood products (particularly for
construction) and also to replace fossil fuels with forestry biomass.
5. Monitoring-evaluation and indicators
We will need to establish a system to monitor the implementation of the major strategic actions in
this sector, making use of the indicators supplied by the National Wood and Forestry Programme
as well as the work of the ONRB's Wood & Forestry Module and the Joint Economic Monitoring
initiative created by the wood sector (these resources are currently in the launch phase).
This could involve scheduling regular studies (frequency to be determined) focusing on a number
77of subjects. We will also need to define new indicators, in order to keep track of:
 the optimisation of the 'carbon pump' effect (the phenomenon whereby carbon from the
atmosphere is captured by ecosystems);
 the efficacy, in terms of climate change mitigation, of making use of the biomass generated
by this 'carbon pump' (and particularly a macro indicator for the wood-forestry sector)
Pertinent indicators for these criteria, as well as the time-frames involved, are the subject of their
own detailed chapter, as well as the UTCATF appendix.
Furthermore, the sustainability of the resources used and the environmental quality of the sector as
a whole must also be monitored closely. Sustainable forestry management indicators could be
useful in this respect. France also supports the creation of a European scheme to monitor the
sustainability of solid biomass, with procedures and criteria which would allow us to guarantee the
sustainability of all biomass used within our country (even if it is imported).
78v. Industry
1. Current state of affairs and carbon challenges
Emissions from industry account for 18% of France's total greenhouse gas emissions. These
emissions have dropped by 27% since 1990 (see Section 1.1 for an explanation of the reasons for
this fall). 75% of these emissions are covered by the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU
ETS).
Factors which determine the level of industrial emissions:
Key messages:
The Trajectory Committee (2012) calculated that reducing emissions from all sectors to a quarter of
their 1990 levels by 2050 would require an 85% reduction in direct emissions from the industrial
sector. The target set in the third carbon budget is consistent with reaching this long-term objective.
The transition to a low-carbon industrial sector by 2050 will involve (in decreasing order of priority
or chronologically):
 energy efficiency to drive down the energy and materials consumed to make products;
 recycling, reuse and energy recuperation to minimise consumption of energy and materials;
 energy substitution in order to reduce the prominence of high-emission energy sources as a
proportion of overall industrial consumption;
 the development and deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the long term, in
order to reduce the GHG intensity of energy generation and industrial processes.
792. Strategy (2030 and 2050)
Emissions reductions will be driven by the following actions:
European and international level
• The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS): The 'cap and trade' programme
introduced by the ETS is based on setting an ambitious emissions target for the European
Union (-1.74%/year between 2012 and 2020, then -2.2%/year between 2020 and 2030),
allowing us to achieve a 43% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030. With reference to this
maximum value for emissions permitted across Europe as a whole, a carbon price will be
introduced allowing all parties to optimise their investment strategy in line with their emission
reduction capacities, easing time pressures. Emission reduction efforts can then be traded on
the European market, which will determine the most economically beneficial actions for
industrial stakeholders. While carbon prices are only one factor in the investment decisions of
industrial stakeholders (who must take all costs into account, including raw materials and
energy and their future predictability, with reference to the timescale of their investments), they
at least permit us to set ambitious objectives and spur all parties into action with a clear price
signal. Our governments will be responsible for ensuring that these investments create an
environment conducive to the continued international competitiveness of our industries.
• In this respect, the creation of a carbon price system in the major economies outside the
European Union is the best guarantee of fair incentives on a global level, in support of the
green economy and the long-term competitiveness of European industry. During the interim
period where equivalent measures have not yet been implemented in other major economies,
measures must be introduced to protect against the risk of 'carbon leakage' (shifting production
offshore to countries with less stringent environmental regulations, which is damaging to our
economy as well as to the environment). This might include the granting of quotas to those
sectors most at risk of carbon leakage, equivalent to 100% of their benchmark level (carbon
intensity reference figures for products and sectors, as defined by the European Commission).
This method has already proved to be efficient in limiting carbon leakage.39 The current system
will be improved when the EU ETS scheme is revised for 2020 onwards, and quota allocations
should be introduced on the basis of each sector's actual exposure, particularly in terms of
international trade and the impact of quota prices on value added.
At national level
The reference scenario expects the industrial sector to improve its energy efficiency performance
to the tune of 20% by 2030 (energy used per tonne produced, compared with 2010 levels). The
potential improvements for each sector are estimated at: 8% for steel, 13% for primary metals,
18% for chemicals, 19% for non-metal minerals, 29% for food and agriculture, 28% for machinery
and 25% for other sectors. These figures are based on data from ADEME and CEREN;
A. Taking action to reduce emissions from burning fuel for energy
• Bringing energy demand under control by improving energy efficiency:
• from combustion
• by product (Kwh/product)
thanks in particular to GHG accounts and energy audits, allowing us to define and quantify the
available options and facilitate optimised decision-making.
Investment in energy efficiency may also be catalysed by an influx of third-party financing and
guaranteed return on investment, thanks to energy efficiency services of proven quality.
39 The absence of carbon leakage prior to 2013 is corroborated by various econometric studies. cf. in particular the
'Carbon Leakage Evidence Project', Ecorys 2013.
80• Reducing the greenhouse gas intensity of energy production:
- reducing fossil fuels with fuels that release less CO , such as gas (which can be
2
renewable in the form of biomethane and power-to-gas systems), sustainable
biomass or waste burning (especially with the development of refuse-derived fuels
[RDF]), with respect for waste processing priorities. These sources can be used to
produce heat for industrial processes. Alternatively, clean electricity may be used.
The reference scenario predicts that the decarbonisation of the electricity mix could
lead industrial stakeholders to use more electric power (to reduce CO  emissions).
2
This would help us to achieve our target of a 30% reduction in final fossil energy
consumption by 2030 (compared to 2012).
- recuperating fatal heat for reuse in industrial facilities and via heat networks (cf. 3.vi
Energy Production). By 2030, the reference scenario expects to see the reuse of
10TWh of heat annually, recovered from sources of waste heat over 100°C.
- developing and deploying carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture
and use (CCU) technologies suitable for use in the chemical industry, hitting our
target of an 85% reduction by 2050.
B. Limiting the greenhouse gas intensity of products used:
• Replacing high-emission materials with low-emission alternatives, such as bio-based
materials
• Optimising the use of raw materials  (more efficient use of resources, less waste),
increasing recycling and reuse of materials.  The reference scenario for 2030 forecasts
a 90% recycling rate for steel, 80% for aluminium, 80-85% for glass and 90% for paper.40
This increase in recycling will contribute to the overall improvement in the energy efficiency
of the sector (cf. infra).
• Promoting the eco-design of products in order to improve their durability, modularity,
repairability and recyclability.
• Replacing fluorinated gases (which have a high radiative forcing potential) with less
harmful alternatives, increasing the recuperation of fluids from machines at the end
of their life cycle, developing processes which require less fluid.  The reference
scenario predicts a 55% reduction in emissions between 1990 and 2030.
• Improving manufacturing processes to reduce emissions at the source: in the
chemical sector for example, with processes which cut emissions at the source and avoid
the need for further emissions (cf. the example of N O emissions in the fabrication of adipic
2
acid (E355).
• Developing CCS for industrial processes in sectors such as steel and cement. The
development of CCS could be galvanised by an increase in CO2 usage in chemistry or food
production.
 C. Cross-cutting f actors:
• Developing the circular economy: In order to increase reuse and recycling and reduce
the overall quantity of waste, it is vital that the industrial sector should promote eco-design
and the reuse of its products. More generally, businesses have a crucial role to play in
40 The potential sources of efficiency gains have been evaluated by the DGPR.
81reducing consumption emissions (cf. 3.2.i) by manufacturing and selling products which
perform better and emit less throughout their life cycle (products which are energy-
efficiency, recyclable or reusable, services which replace products in the new functional
economy etc.). The government can support this dynamic by creating labels which help
consumers to identify high-quality products which will last for a long time and can be easily
repaired. This will help to boost the already highly-active market for second-hand goods,
and make repairs an important and well-structured sector of the modern economy, requiring
considerable digital and logistical skills: a new industrial revolution.
• Extending and amplifying support for innovation: our goal must be to reduce the cost of
decarbonising industrial processes and make technological options such as electrification
and carbon capture economically viable (cf. 3.2. iii research, innovation and deployment).
 In the medium term, the competitive capacities of industry will be heavily
dependent on the ability of governments to implement innovative systems to support
R&D, finance the development of businesses, define the structure of new chains,
provide training etc.
 At the European level, efforts to structure and support R&D - particularly the
Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-PLAN) and the HORIZON 2020 research
and innovation framework strategy - must be extended and amplified. Training
programmes and their funding must be recognised as urgent priorities of the energy
transition. The EU must nurture the emergence of new chains of excellence in
renewable energies and low-carbon technologies, as well as energy efficiency. It is
essential that the EU should assume a leading role in the development of industrial
technologies to limit consumption, minimise emissions and phase out fossil fuels. In
doing so we can stake out a prime position in the global market for low-carbon
energy technology.
D. Implementation challenges:
• Developing bio-chemistry and green production chains at local level: this will help us
to reduce emissions, thanks to the use of bio-based products, while also developing a
stable industrial network and ensuring that it remains competitive in the long term. With this
goal in mind, a certain number of organisational, regulatory and technical obstacles will
need to be overcome by 2030.
• Boosting the profile of the carbon price signal and ensuring that its future trajectory
is clear: Increasing the visibility and predictability of the carbon price signal will allow us to
reassure industrial stakeholders of the profitability of their investments, making the carbon
price a vital decision-making tool consistent with our environmental ambitions.  Some
industrial stakeholders are keen to see credible constraints introduced by 2030, backed up
with immediate tightening of the regulations which govern the carbon market.
• In order to protect the competitiveness of those sectors which are most exposed to the risks
of carbon leakage, the use of free quota allocations based on an ambitious benchmarking
system   is   a   satisfactory   method   whose   implementation   leaves   room   for   further
improvement. The current system of free quota allocations needs to be revised in order to:
More effectively target those sectors which are most at risk, given that the total volume
of available quotas for industry is decreasing;
Establish a more dynamic allocation system which offers incentives for keeping
production in Europe without penalising companies' growth, while also limiting
windfall effects.
Reform the system for compensating indirect costs, which is currently wracked with
distortions, to make it harmonised, transparent and systematic. The goal is to
compensate those sectors which are generally exposed to the risk of carbon
leakage in terms of CO  costs being passed on via electricity prices.
2
82E. Points to be watched closely:
 Investment 'lock-in' effects:  The life expectancy of industrial facilities is counted in
decades, and technological choices will have long-term repercussions for emissions. In
order to avoid harmful 'lock-in' effects, long-term visibility regarding environmental policies
is essential.
 Industrial competitiveness: Some sectors are exposed to international competition, and
we need to ensure that the instruments we use to drive down emissions do not also lead to
deindustrialisation.  Targeted, effective protective measures will be required, within the
framework described in this strategy.
 Efficient inter-sectoral mobilisation and use of biomass  (cf. 3.3. iv Forestry and
Biomass)
 Boosting recognition of GHG accounts with recognisable labels.
3. Coordinating the national low-carbon strategy with other plans and 
programmes
• This coordination will be particularly important in the field of R&D (see Chapter 3.2.iii
Research & Innovation Policy) and, more broadly, in the implementation of plans devoted to
the modernisation of France's industrial capacities, such as the 'Future of Industry' strategy.
• The future development of measures to promote renewable energies and energy efficiency,
such as the heat fund (inc. BCIAT) and energy certification schemes, must also take
account of targets for the industrial sector and potential energy savings to be found in
SMEs.
• The SNBC must be effectively coordinated with regional industrial policies and the new
Regional Economic Development Plans introduced by the NOTRe Act.
83vi. Energy production
1. Current state of affairs and carbon challenges
Emissions from energy production currently account for 12% of France's greenhouse gas
emissions, and 85% of these emissions are covered by the EU emissions trading scheme (EU
ETS). These emissions fell by 27% between 1990 and 2013 (just over 30% when corrected for
climate conditions).
Emissions linked to electricity production
• In light of the structure of France's power mix, electricity production has historically been
low-carbon. In 2013, the mix was: nuclear 74% (77% in 2014), hydroelectric 13%, fossil
fuels (coal, gas, oil) 9% (5% in 2014) and solar, wind and renewable thermal energies 4%
(5% in 2014). Greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production thus originate from a
small sub-section of the sector.
• Structural phenomena have propelled recent reductions in these emissions, and this
dynamic should continue: a sharp decline in the number of coal-fired power stations in
favour of renewable energies and stations which also run on gas, with much lower GHG
emissions, as well as the rise of renewable energies and the success of energy efficiency
measures.
• Annual GHG emissions are subject to sizeable fluctuations, which become proportionally
more significant as the overall level of emissions declines. Circumstantial phenomena
(mild or harsh winters influencing demand for heating, rainfall levels determining the level of
hydroelectric energy available) thus determine the demand placed upon back-up energy
sources.
• Finally, it is important to bear in mind that the operational viability of production facilities
running on fossil fuels is also largely dependent on the interconnected European market,
with complex border effects caused by a mixture of short-term (power station shut-downs,
as seen in Belgium in late 2014) and structural factors (changes in the energy mix of our
neighbours).
84Emissions from district heating:41
• Emissions from this sector depend primarily on the sources of its energy. Fossil fuels
accounted for 57% (42% natural gas, 9% coal and 4% heating oil) of the total output of
France's 518 heating and cooling networks in 2013. The two major action priorities must
therefore be to make the shift towards more renewable resources, and to improve energy
efficiency.
Emissions from refineries:
• Since 1990, France's direct emissions have fallen by 32%. But this fall can be attributed to
the closure of four refineries in France and the decline in our net output of refined products
(-30% since 2007). This decrease is therefore not significant in terms of climate change
mitigation. The decline of French production has been offset by an increase in imported
products, which are refined (and thus generate emissions) in Asia or the Middle East. At
France's remaining refineries, it is important to highlight the steady process of optimisation
which has been underway since the 1970s, allowing us to achieve a CO2 intensity score
which was close to the EU average in 2012. It receives very little attention, but this hard
work illustrates the benefits of preserving French industry: tackling climate change is not
just a matter of reducing our national emissions, we need to take the overall carbon
footprint into account.
Other emissions from this sector:
• Fugitive emissions from combustible fuels, particularly methane, have been cut in half since
1990.42 This can be attributed to the closure of several coal mines and processing plants.
Emissions generated by the transformation of solid mineral fuels (SMF) and other fuel
sources have fallen by 35% since 1990, as coke production has declined.
2. Strategy (2050 and beyond, 2030)
By 2050, our target is to reduce the emissions from energy production by 96% compared to their
1990 levels (Trajectory Committee, 2012), a 'Factor 20' improvement. This will mean:
• accelerating increases in energy efficiency  (Factor 2): reducing the overall energy
intensity of GDP and getting a handle on total energy demand (priority will go to reducing
the consumption of carbonised energy and switching to clean electricity).
• radical decarbonisation of the energy mix by 2050 (Factor 10):  (reducing the
gCO2/kWh ratio of electricity and heat networks). We must not forget that the ambitious
targets set out in our reference scenarios are based on the assumption that there will be a
widespread roll-out of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies by 2050. If this
proves not to be the case, the decarbonisation of energy production will have to come from
other sources, including other sectors of the economy.
A. Managing and regulating demand:
• Boosting energy efficiency, focusing our efforts on carbonised energy sources.
• Electrification
• Smoothing out seasonal and daily consumption peaks, in order to reduce the use of
back-up (carbonised) energy sources to meet demand:
◦ Developing load management and offsetting capacities (the MEP contains targets
for the development of load management measures, making use of the opportunities
offered by the installation of new 'Linky' connected meters)
◦ Coordinating these efforts with other public policies when it comes to making
decisions regarding different energy vectors, and particularly with regard to incentives
41 District heating: Centralised heat production, for distribution to third parties via the grid.
42 Fugitive emissions from the extraction, processing and distribution of solid, liquid and gaseous fuels.
85for switching to electric power sources, in order to protect and even increase our
capacity to control demand for electricity (e.g. the deployment of electric vehicles,
guiding users to charging stations which are not powered by carbon-intensive energy,
reducing the sensitivity of electricity consumption to temperature variations by reducing
the proportion of electrical heating in homes etc.)
Target for total reduction in the consumption of energy from fossil fuels: -30% reduction by 2030
(from 2012)
B. Decarbonisation and flexibility of the energy mix:
B.1 Electricity production
• Keeping a handle on investments in fossil-fuel-fired power stations, given the life
expectancy of these facilities and the ambitious nature of our emissions objectives:
◦ Precautions must be taken to ensure that back-up power stations intended to help meet
demand in peak periods do not end up supplying 'semi-basic' energy needs in certain
years (the Energy Transition and Green Growth Act imposes a cap on their operating
hours in order to ensure that our legally-declared greenhouse gas emissions targets are
respected).
◦ In order to meet our 'semi-basic' energy requirements, we must avoid investing in new
power generation facilities running on fossil fuels. These will be of no use to us in the
medium term, in light of the growth of renewable energy sources; in fact they could turn
out to be an obstacle to the development of renewables.
◦ With regard to combined plants running partly on natural gas, priority should be afforded
to facilities which are sufficiently flexible to allow for a subsequent transition to
combined production with renewable sources.
◦ We need to plan ahead for the deployment of carbon capture and storage systems at
any fossil fuel-fired power stations which may still be in operation by 2050 (retrofitting
where necessary), taking storage considerations into account when selecting the
location of new facilities.
➔ Requirements in terms of new thermal resources will be covered in detail in the
MEPs, in accordance with the strategic orientations adopted in other sectors,
supply security targets (to which the capacity market also contributes) and the
need for flexibility in the electricity system, within the limits imposed by the
carbon budgets.
• Improving the flexibility of the system without increasing emissions:
In the long term, integrating renewable energies will require greater flexibility; in order to meet this
requirement and guarantee the security of the energy supply, we will need to harmonise and
optimise coverage for peak periods, demand management, storage and interconnections.
◦ We will also need to increase the flexibility of the hydroelectric energy sector, which can
produce a substantial amount of energy at peak periods;
◦ We will develop intelligent storage networks, deploying reserves as and when required:
week-by-week to compensate for intermittent wind energy production between now and
2030, day-by-day storage when solar power production reaches significant levels after
2030; transfers between energy systems (power-to-gas, power-to-heat);
◦ Another priority will be to develop interconnections with neighbouring countries in order
to feed the renewable energy boom, in synergy with the EU energy strategy.
• In zones which are not connected to this network: developing non-intermittent renewable
energy production
86In non-interconnected zones (ZNI), specific solutions will be required in order to capitalise on the
rise of renewable energies. On account of their limited size, these ZNIs do not benefit from the
combined effects of geographical and temporal overlap we see on Metropolitan France, making
intermittent supply a more serious problem. Non-intermittent renewable energies such as biomass
and geothermal power are particularly well-suited to the demands of ZNIs, and should be
encouraged.
The development of storage and demand management - rendered essential by the intermittent
supply from wind and solar power facilities - will be particularly important to the success of the
energy transition in the islands, helping us to reach our goal of full energy autonomy for the
overseas territories by 2030.
B.2 Heat networks
• Steering   production   towards   renewable   heat   sources  and   heat   recovery:   thermal
renewables (biomass, geothermal etc.) and recovery of fatal heat (heat given off by
industrial processes or thermal inertia in buildings)
• Developing district heating networks, allowing for greater use of renewable energy sources
and more heat recovery
Our objective is for 38% of total heat consumption to be supplied by renewable sources by 2030,
while also multiplying 5-fold the proportion of renewable and recovered energy in the heating and
cooling networks by 2030 (from 2012 levels).
B.3. European and international level
• The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS)
The management of emissions from energy production will be primarily handled by the EU
emissions trading scheme. As this is a Europe-wide programme, it requires no specific
recommendations in this national low-carbon strategy.
The management of emission reductions in this sector will depend primarily on the evolution
of the targets set by the ETS, and as such can only be envisaged on a European scale. National
policies nonetheless have a vital role to play, facilitating the planned evolution of the French energy
mix, in cooperation with our neighbours.
• Refineries
Above and beyond driving down demand for oil products (cf. section on transport, industry and
construction), reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from refineries will require increased
international cooperation. This sector is subject to intense international competition: the Nelson
complexity index (the higher the score, the more competitive the refinery) and the reduction of
sulphur content in fuels have both contributed to making refining activities more energy-intensive.
Furthermore, the increase in the amount of "poor quality" crude oil on the market could lead to a
further increase in emissions per litre processed.  
In light of these factors, we need to make sure that the measures taken to reduce emissions in this
sector do not simply lead to oil refinery operations being shifted offshore to other countries. This
requires a comprehensive approach, above and beyond the national level.
3. Coordinating the national low-carbon strategy with the plans and programmes developed
for the energy sector
• The Energy Transition and Green Growth Act (LTECV) stipulates that the Multiannual
Energy Plan for mainland France must be compatible with the national low-carbon strategy
(SNBC).
• This will be taken into account for:
87◦ the specific Multiannual Energy Plans for non-interconnected zones
◦ the Regional Development, Sustainable Governance and Territorial Equality Schemes
(SRADDET, superseding the current regional climate-air-energy strategies)
◦ the Territorial Climate-Air-Energy Plans (PCAET). This link may be indirect, if the
SRADDET already incorporates the provisions of the national strategy.
4. Special circumstances in overseas territories
While emissions from electricity production in the overseas territories are relatively low in
volume compared to those from Metropolitan France, the energy mix remains highly carbon-
dependent (78% from classic thermal energy sources). The goal is for France's overseas territories
to achieve energy independence by 2030.  Our ambitious objective of achieving energy
independence for these territories will require a thorough decarbonisation of electricity production,
before we can think about usage transfers. The ZNI recommendations also apply in the overseas
territories.
5. Monitoring-evaluation and indicators
As this sector is covered almost in its entirety by the ETS scheme, the strategic management of
emissions will take place primarily at European level.
At the national level, the Multiannual Energy Plans will be the most strategically-important tools.
Most strategically significant indicators:
• greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector
• proportion of electricity production derived from the combustion of fossil fuels
88vii. Waste management
1. Current state of affairs and carbon challenges
The waste management sector accounted for 4% of France's total greenhouse gas emissions in
2013. Since 1990, these emissions have increased by 13%. Methane from waste storage sites
accounts for the majority of these emissions (75%).
2. Strategy (2030 and 2050)
As per the recommendations of the 'Trajectory Committee' (2012), the objective for the waste
management sector is a -75% reduction by 2050.
With this goal in mind, our long-term action priorities (in decreasing order of precedence) will be as
follows:
1. Reducing the volume of waste produced by preventive measures (ecodesign, extending the
lifespan of products, repairs, minimising food waste) and reuse (the circular economy),
2. Making better use of waste material which cannot be avoided (recycling),
3. Using unavoidable waste which cannot be reused in material form for energy purposes,
4. Reducing methane emissions from landfills and treatment plants, particularly non-
recoverable gas,
5. Stop incineration unless the energy is captured and used.
These five actions will be undertaken simultaneously.  At stake here is the transition towards a
more circular  economic model, a paradigm shift from our current model of production and
consumption (efficient use of materials, resources and energy; long-term value, more jobs).
Widespread sorting of organic waste by 2025 (Art. 70 of the LTECV) will be particularly important in
reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Special care must be taken over the technical and
financial conditions of its implementation.
89In the immediate short term, two actions derived from point 4 should also be highlighted:
• capture and flaring of gas emissions from landfills, for immediate use. The reference
scenario predicts that the rate of biogas capture from landfills will increase from 38% in
2010 to 70% in 2030, and the rate of usage of this biogas will increase from 59% to 80%:
these are strategically-significant measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from
the sector.
• optimising the energy and climate performance of waste water treatment facilities, with
strategic investments (production, collection and use of methane; recovering heat from
waste water).
•
Points to be watched closely:
• The massive wave of home renovations will generate huge volumes of waste, including
mineral materials (which can be reused in building and public works) and combustibles
(which can be used for energy purposes).
3. 
Coordinating the national low-carbon strategy with the plans and programmes 
developed for the waste management sector
• Waste Management Plans (the Waste Plan for 2014-2020 should allow us to reduce GHG
emissions by 2.8 Mt CO2 equivalent per year between now and 2025),
• National Waste Prevention Programme,
• the EMAA Plan (energy, methanisation, nitrogen independence)
• regulations for listed installations and instructions for their implementation (collection and
treatment of methane from landfills),
• Master Plans for the Development and Management of Water, and national sanitation
regulations, which will designate the treatment plants concerned and the resources to be
put in place.
4. Special circumstances in the Overseas Departments
The most significant waste-related constraint in the Overseas Territories, as far as carbon
emissions are concerned, is the high cost of transporting waste for treatment on the mainland and
the impossibility of processing it on site, in light of the regulatory constraints imposed by the Basel
convention. Further work is required to identify opportunities for pooling facilities with neighbouring
countries, and questions arising from the Basel convention.
5. Monitoring-evaluation and indicators
Indicators included in the National Waste Management Plan
• monitoring methane collection from landfills
• To be determined, in the sanitation sector
• indicators from the EMAA strategy
90C  4: M      
HAPTER ONITORING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF
 
THIS STRATEGY
4.1. Carbon budgets
i. The first three budgets
The first carbon budget will allow us to respect our commitments up to the year 2020.
The levels of the second and third carbon budgets take into account our objective for 2030, and
are consistent with Europe's promised contribution to the international climate agreement of 2015,
i.e. reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% (from their 1990 levels) by 2030.
The reduction of emissions from those facilities which generate the most greenhouse gases will be
managed at European level (via the EU Emissions Trading Scheme), with a separate target of a
43% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030.
In other sectors (transport, construction etc.), the target is to reduce European emissions by 30%
from their 2005 levels by 2030. The manner in which these reduction efforts will be split between
the different EU members will be finalised in 2017. This distribution will be based on the GDP per
capita of each Member State, with adjustments allowing us to exploit the most cost-effective
sources of potential reductions among countries whose GDP is above the European average. For
the time being, the distribution of carbon budgets between the ETS and non-ETS sectors for the
periods 2019-2023 and 2024-2028 has not yet been finalised. This distribution may be finalised

are updated in mid-2019.

2019-2023 399 Mt CO eq

2024-2028 358 Mt CO eq

The greenhouse gas emissions accounted for above correspond to the totals reported by the
French government to the European Commission as per our European and international
commitments under the aegis of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,
particularly in application of Article 7 of Regulation 525/2013. 525/2013. The geographical scope
applied here corresponds to France's commitments under the second phase of the Kyoto protocol,
i.e. emissions from the mainland, Corsica and Guadeloupe, Guiana, Martinique, Reunion, Saint-
91Martin and Mayotte as well as emissions from transport between these territories. Emissions from
other countries and overseas territories are excluded, as are emissions from international aviation
and maritime transport.
The position of agriculture and land usage in this schema requires further clarification. When
determining the carbon budgets for the periods 2015-2018, 2019-2023 and 2024-2028, the
emissions associated with land usage and changes (i.e. variations in the volume of carbon stored
in the soil) and forestry activities will not be included, on account of the fact that the method to be
used to quantify these emissions with regard to France's European engagements for 2030 have
not yet been determined. Organic carbon capture associated with land use will be incorporated into
the carbon budget for 2029-2033, scheduled for mid-2019. The accounting methods used in the
implementation of the Energy and Climate Plan for 2030 will be applied here. The carbon budgets
for 2019-2023 and 2024-2028 will also be revised to incorporate these emissions, without
significant alterations to the efforts demanded of other sectors of the economy.
The distribution of the emissions reduction burden between those sectors primarily governed at EU
level (the ETS and, depending on the outcome of future negotiations, some emissions from
agriculture and/or land usage) and other sectors (for which France will be bound by commitments
made to the EU) will also be clarified at this juncture.
92ii. Guideline breakdown by sector and by type of gas
The burden of reducing emissions can be broken down broadly between different sectors of
activity, and different types of gas:

of which CH4 71 44 42 41 40
of which fluorinated gases 12 21 20 16 10
This breakdown is given for guideline purposes only.
It is derived from the forward studies (cf. Section 1.2) conducted by a panel of stakeholders,
experts and modelling specialists, particularly the Trajectory Committee (France Stratégie, 2012),
as well as the hypotheses and results from the reference scenario, directly inspired by the AMS2
scenario derived from the climate-air-energy studies conducted by the Ministry for Ecology and
ADEME in 2015.
It represents a fairly-balanced distribution of emissions reduction efforts, based on the political
decisions described above (cf. Part 2.1). For each of these sectors, this breakdown also takes
account of economical, technical and practical considerations such as the cost of mitigation, the
inertia induced by previous or forthcoming investments, the level of organisation or federation of
93the stakeholders involved, the potential difficulty of mobilising the necessary resources or changing
behaviours etc.
As such, the carbon budgets presented here do not represent a rigid compartmentalisation of
objectives for different sectors. They offer an initial sector-by-sector distribution intended to steer
overall progress, with adjustments between sectors made wherever necessary. When reductions
look likely to be smaller than expected in certain sectors, we will need to take measures allowing
us to make more substantial reductions in other sectors. This breakdown is an essential
component of the low-carbon strategy's arsenal of indicators, providing signals regarding the risk of
not meeting our overall targets, and highlighting areas in need of corrective measures.
iii. Breaking down the carbon budgets into components 
reflecting annual emissions
The emissions trajectory used as a point of reference for the carbon budgets can be broken down
into annual targets:
Years Indicative annual components (Mt
CO eq)
2
2015 457
2016 447
2017 437
2018 427
2019 417
2020 407
2021 399
2022 391
2023 383
2024 374
2025 366
2026 358
2027 351
2028 343
Numerous circumstantial factors can justify year-to-year variations which stray from this guideline
breakdown (climate conditions, economic outlook, fluctuations in the prices of different fuels on the
international market etc.). As cold winters can lead to significant increases in heating demand, it is
advisable to correct for these effects to ensure that the comparison between annual emissions
results remains pertinent. Over the time-frame covered by the carbon budgets (four to five years),
the effect of these circumstantial factors is less significant.
iv. Evaluating the implementation of carbon budgets
At the conclusion of each carbon budget period, the extent to which the budget has been
respected will be assessed with reference to the most recent annual inventories submitted to the
European Commission or the UN Framework Convention, with the exception of the last year in the
budget period, for which we will use the provisional inventories submitted to the European
94Commission.
If the greenhouse gas accounting system should change in a manner which requires previous
emissions to be corrected by more than one percent, the balance of the carbon budget will be
adjusted accordingly in order to ensure that the calculation methodology employed is consistent
with the methodology which will be used to evaluate the results.
Analysis of the implementation of the low-carbon strategy and our adherence to carbon budgets
must take the political context into account, as well as the actual capacity of the actions put in
place to deliver the results expected of each sector. Managing the impact of these measures on
the public finances is a key priority. A posteriori analysis should allow us to identify cost-efficiency
and acceptability issues which were not accurately quantified when drawing up the original
strategy.
954.2. Monitoring indicators
These indicators must be monitored annually or twice annually. They will be more effective within
the framework of a cross-cutting analysis, taking the general and sector-specific context into
account. It may also be useful to look at the European context and establish comparisons with
other Member States. Guideline trajectories (with a few years' perspective, and as far as 2028)
may also be of use. This is a draft version, which may be reorganised and restructured with the
help of the committee of experts for the energy transition.
These indicators will be made public. They will be aimed primarily at the stakeholders involved in
drawing up this strategy, who will also be involved in monitoring its progress. They will also be
designed to reinforce cooperation with partners and regional and territorial level. The committee
of experts for the energy transition will be involved with the annual implementation review,
and bi-annual updates will be provided to the CNTE, at which point the monitoring
indicators will be published.
In addition to these indicators, monitoring must also take into account the issues flagged up in the
'Points to be watched closely' section of Chapter 3.

5.1. Making sure that we meet the objectives set out by law,
and   respect   France's   European   and   international
commitments with carbon budgets and an effective low-
carbon strategy
Article 173 of the Energy Transition and Green Growth act stipulates that, no later than four
months before the publication deadline, the government must draw up and publish a report which
explains how the carbon budgets and low-carbon strategy will be reconciled with the objectives
stipulated in Article L. 100-4 of the Energy Code, as well as France's European and international
commitments. The extent to which we are on track to hit these objectives is analysed here.
A. Objectives of the Energy Transition and Green Growth Act (Art. L.100-4 of the Energy
Code)
Art. L. 100-4. – I. – Objectives of the national energy policy:
1. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% between 1990 and 2030, and reduce them to a
quarter of 1990 levels by 2050. The corresponding trajectory is set out in detail in the carbon
budgets mentioned in Article L.222-1 A of the Environment Code;
The National Low-Carbon Strategy (SNBC) sets out a roadmap and includes sector-specific
recommendations, with a view to reaching our target of a 40% reduction between 1990 and 2030
and maintaining a trajectory consistent with slashing emissions to a quarter of their 1990 levels by
2050. The trajectory mapped out in the carbon budgets should allow us to achieve a 42% reduction
in emissions by 2030 (from 1990 levels). This intermediate target is consistent with a 75%
reduction by 2050. According to the calculations of the Trajectory Committee (2012), who
considered several reduction trajectories ranging from 33% to 41% in 2030, a trajectory close to
the top end of this spectrum (-41%) is the best way to respect the principles of intergenerational
fairness.
2. To cut final energy consumption to 50% of its 2012 level by 2050, with an intermediate target of
20% by 2030. This dynamic will support the development of an energy-efficient economy,
particularly in the construction and transport sectors and the circular economy, while also
protecting the competitiveness and development of the industrial sector;
The trajectory set out in the carbon budgets will allow us to achieve a 22% reduction in final energy
consumption between 2012 and 2030. By extending the rate of reduction for the period 2025-2030
(-1.43%/year) after 2030, we will succeed in cutting consumption in half between 2012 and 2050.
The SNBC sets out energy efficiency actions to be taken in the different sectors: renovation of old
buildings, improving the energy performance of vehicles (average fuel consumption of 2l per
100km for all cars sold in 2030), developing the circular economy (reuse and recycling) etc. This
dynamic will allow us to protect the competitiveness and continued development of the industrial
sector (cf. the evaluation of the macro-economic effects of this strategy in Chapter 5). The
objectives set out here for the industrial sector have been calculated on the basis of an annual
growth rate of industrial value added estimated at 1.6% for the period 2016-2020, 2.0% for 2021-
2025, 1.5% for 2026-2030 and 1.3% for 2031-2035.
106Nevertheless, it is worth bearing in mind that it falls to the Multiannual Energy Plans (MEP) to
provide detailed targets for energy efficiency.
3. To reduce primary energy consumption from fossil fuels by 30% by 2030 (from the reference
year 2012), adapting this target to each category of fossil fuel on the basis of their greenhouse gas
emission factors;
The trajectory set out in the carbon budgets will allow us to reach this objective. The reference
scenario on which this trajectory is based predicts reductions in primary energy consumption from
fossil fuels by 2030 which exceed this objective.
The SNBC will, however, propose modulations to these targets based on GHG emission
factors, with two clear examples (in addition to the gradual increase in the weight of the
carbon component in domestic taxes on energy consumption):
◦ in the residential-tertiary sector, when renewing systems which have reached the end of
their life cycle, we will encourage home-owners to avoid the most carbon-intensive
heating systems (those with emissions of more than 300g CO /kWh)
2
◦ diversifying the energy mix in the transport sector, in order to reduce the carbon
intensity of the energy sources used by 6% between 2013 and the conclusion of the 3rd
carbon budget.
4. To increase renewable energy usage to 23% of gross final energy consumption by 2020 and
32% by 2030; at this date, in order to satisfy this objective, renewable energy sources will need to
account for 40% of electricity production, 38% of final heat consumption, 15% of final fuel
consumption and 10% of gas consumption;
The SNBC supports the development of renewable energies, and the carbon budgets are
compatible with these objectives.
Nonetheless, it is worth bearing in mind that it falls to the Multiannual Energy Plans (MEP)
to provide detailed targets for the development of renewable energies.
5. To reduce the share of nuclear power in total energy production to 50% by 2025;
It does not fall within the remit of the SNBC to provide a precise breakdown of the electricity mix,
as long as this mix meets the emissions reduction targets contained in the carbon budgets and
follows the recommendations of this strategy. The MEP, which is compatible with the SNBC, will
determine the share of nuclear power in the energy mix.
However, the SNBC is compatible with the objective of reducing our reliance on nuclear power,
with recommendations focusing on the development of renewable alternatives.
6. To help meet the objectives on reducing atmospheric pollution found in the national strategy for
the reduction of atmospheric pollutants, set out in Article L. 222-9 of the Environment Code;
These legally-defined objectives and measures make a strong contribution to reducing emissions
which cause atmospheric pollution (cf. Part 4.3). The PREPA document will explore these
objectives in greater detail.
7. Manage housing stock so that all buildings are renovated to "low-consumption building"
standard by 2050, with a programme of thermal renovation subsidies aimed primarily at low-
107income households;
The strategy expects all existing buildings to be renovated to "low-consumption building" standard
by 2050. The trajectory on which the carbon budgets are based also requires renovation of the
most energy-inefficient private homes (energy class F or worse) by the end of the third carbon
budget.
8. To achieve energy independence for the Overseas Departments by 2030, with an intermediate
target of 50% renewable energies by 2020;
Meeting this objective will requires additional, locally-specific measures, to be defined in the MEPs.
9. To multiply by five the quantity of renewable and recovered heating and cooling provided by
heating and cooling networks by 2030.
The SNBC and the carbon budgets include this objective of multiplying by five the quantity of
renewable and recovered heating and cooling provided by heating and cooling networks by 2030.
VIII – The Government's objective for the carbon component - incorporated into domestic taxes on
the consumption of energy products as per Table B, Paragraph 1 of Article 265 of the Customs
Code - is to reach a carbon price of €56 by 2020 and €100 by 2030.
This increase is written into the strategy, and is one of the instruments which will allow us to stick to
our carbon budgets.
This target for the carbon component of energy taxes is naturally included in the reference
scenario, replacing or complementing the measures initially contained therein. This target makes
carbon pricing more explicit and less implicit (the implicit carbon price is the valuation used by
economists to express the combined effect of all non-fiscal constraints and incentives aiming to
limit carbon emissions).
B. European and international commitments
European target of -14% greenhouse gas emissions (exc. ETS) between 2005 and 2020:
This objective will be easily met by sticking to the terms of our first two carbon budgets.
France's international engagements regarding greenhouse gas emissions (Kyoto protocol) are
closely connected with our European commitments, which are virtually equivalent in their scope.
They therefore do not require any further, specific analysis: adhering to these targets is largely a
matter of respecting the first two carbon budgets.
Energy efficiency target for 2020:
In order to meet the target of a 20% improvement in energy efficiency, in 2012 the European Union
adopted an ambitious legislative framework in the form of EU Directive 2012/27 on energy
efficiency.
In order to transpose Article 3 of EU Directive 2012/27 on energy efficiency into national legislation,
France has set itself a target of capping final energy consumption at 131.4 Mtoe by 2020
(excluding international aviation), with a cap of 219.9 Mtoe for primary energy consumption.
Analysis of the different scenarios reveals that these two objectives can be met by a trajectory at
the lower end of the forecast range, based on the twin hypotheses of an ambitious energy
efficiency programme and a gradual improvement of economic conditions.
In the context of the present strategy, we must therefore emphasise the importance of remaining
highly ambitious when determining the concrete measures required to meet our objectives.   The
108gradual increase in the carbon component of energy prices will play a key role here.
Targets for renewable energy development by 2020:
EC Directive 2009/28 on renewable energies in the Climate and Energy Package sets a target of
20% renewable energy in total energy consumption by 2020, across the European Union as a
whole. Within this framework, France is committed to increasing the share of renewable energies
in final energy consumption from barely 10% in 2005 to 23% by 2020. This will mean producing an
extra 20Mtoe of renewable energy, more than doubling the previous level, which was already
substantial thanks to wood energy and hydroelectricity.  France has thus adapted an ambitious
stance on this issue, an ambition reinforced by the objectives contained in the Energy Transition
and Green Growth Act, which sets a target for 32% of final energy consumption to come from
renewable sources by 2030 (cf. infra).
Respecting this objective will require the implementation of dynamic measures within the
framework of the present strategy and the MEPS;
It is worth noting that this objective is closely linked to the energy efficiency objective examined
above, as the target is based on renewable energy as a proportion of total energy consumed.
1095.2. Studying the impact of the decisions made thus far
i. Analysing the economic impact
1. Macro-economic effects
Our evaluation of the macro-economic impact of the decisions taken in the SNBC is based on two
scenarios: a trend-based scenario (the AME scenario, based on existing measures) and a
reference scenario (the AMS2 scenario, with additional measures), as described in Part 2 of the
strategy. The macro-economic impact of the reference scenario is analysed on the basis of its
deviation from the trend-based scenario. This corresponds to the difference in employment figures
and GDP, for a given year or as an average over the period 2014-2035, between the reference
scenario and the trend-based scenario. This difference reflects the impact of the SNBC measures
under consideration here.
Two different models were used for this evaluation: the NEMESIS model developed by SEURECO-
ERASME, and the THREEME model developed by the ADEME and the CGDD. Combining these
two models allows us to adopt a more nuanced approach to the combination of effects we can
expect to see.
Principal conclusions of the macro-economic evaluation
Calculating the macro-economic impact of the reference scenario (AMS2), in relation to the trend-
based scenario, reveals positive results for both GDP and employment. Above and beyond
fluctuations linked to waves of investment, this positive effect can be seen in the boost to average
annual GDP over the period and the average number of extra jobs created each year.
The NEMESIS model predicts that the reference scenario will boost GDP by an average of €25
billion per year over the period 2014-2035, while creating an extra 108,000 jobs per year over
these 22 years.43
The macro-economic evaluation performed by the ADEME using the THREEME model predicts an
annual average GDP boost equivalent to that forecast by the NEMESIS model, with an extra
350,000 jobs created each year over the period 2014-2035.
The detailed results yielded by each of these models are presented below.
The THREEME analysis integrates the gradual increase in the carbon component of domestic
energy consumption taxes from €22 in 2016 to €56/tCO2 in 2020 and €100/tCO2 by 2030 (2015
euros). It is presented in greater detail in the methodological appendix. This integration was not
taken into account in the analysis of the NEMESIS model.
43Calculating the average annual GDP increase and number of new jobs over this 22-year period (2014-
2035) without the additional effort of 170,000 new buildings/year between 2017 and 2021 leaves us with a
GDP boost of 23 billion and 87,000 new jobs/year.
1102. Further analysis of the macro-economic impact of the AMS2 scenario as predicted by the
NEMESIS model
The GDP gap between the reference scenario and the trend-based scenario (black line on figure
5.1 below) is positive throughout the period, which shows that the measures included in the SNBC
will cause economic activity to grow more rapidly than it would in the trend-based scenario for
2014-2035.
Figure 5.1: Evolution of the GDP gap and contribution of GDP aggregates (NEMESIS model)
The additional  investment included in the reference scenario compared to the trend-based
scenario (blue bars), particularly in construction (renovation and new-builds), is the main factor
behind the additional growth seen in AMS2.44 This GDP boost peaks in 2020 (GDP in the reference
scenario is 3.1% above the trend-based scenario). On account of the lending required to finance
these investments, the level of investment effort far outstrips financial provisions until 2022. The
multiplier effect of investment (a boost in growth generates more income, and thus more
consumption) will be in full swing in this period.
An increase in investment will naturally lead to an increase in the demand placed on those sectors
supplying capital assets. In turn, the demand for production inputs (including labour) will increase
in these sectors, in order to meet the increase in demand from clients. New jobs will therefore be
created. These knock-on effects create a virtuous circle, with the multiplier effects of additional
investment generating a spike in activity which exceeds the initial investment: these effects are
referred to as 'Keynesian'.
Once additional investment in new construction comes to an end in 2022 (the hypothesis included
in the reference scenario), the GDP boost drops off to stabilise somewhere between 0.3% and
0.5% between 2014 and 2031. Loan repayments become substantial at this point, and the ebbing
away of the investment surplus (and the corresponding bounce in employment) sees consumption
begin to lose steam. The contribution made by consumption to the GDP gap between AMS2 and
44It should be noted that the additional investment scheduled for other sectors often pales in comparison with the sums
earmarked for the construction sector (although they are nonetheless significant to the stakeholders and activities
concerned). By way of an example, the development of methanisation is expected to generate a significant amount of
additional investment for the agricultural sector; but the sums involved will not far exceed €100 million per annum, which
seems inconsequential compared with the sums shown in figure 5.2 below.
111AME becomes negative from 2024 onwards.
Figure 5.2: investments and financial provisions in the NEMESIS model
Between 2023 and 2035, total financial provisions for investment exceed total investment (cf. figure
5.2). The overall economic situation is expected to deteriorate slightly during this period
(investment   slows,   household   purchasing   power   is   reduced   by   the   repayment   burden,
competitiveness suffers from the price increases induced by strong economic activity and the cost
of the investments made in the period 2017-2021, although these costs are offset by lending,
which spreads the costs and charges over a longer period).
Nonetheless, the final years of the scenario do see a further increase in the GDP gap (reaching
1.3% in 2035). This is partly a result of investment in new electricity production facilities, causing a
new spike in total investment. It is also related to the cumulative effects, from the mid-2020s
onwards, of energy savings (made possible by previous investments), gradually freeing up more
purchasing power and allowing consumption to pick up (and hence reducing the negative
contribution of consumption to the GDP surplus, cf. figure 5.1). Energy efficiency savings have
several consequences for the economy: increased productivity and lower costs for businesses,
increased purchasing power for households and, from a macro-economic perspective, a reduction
in the national energy bill.
Job creation is relatively substantial in the first period of growth (as many as 413,000 extra jobs in
2021, comparing the AMS2 scenario to the AME scenario): households will see their situation in
the labour market improve, with an increase in their income. This upturn in wealth creation will
allow households to increase their consumption in comparison with the trend-based scenario,
particularly since lending helps to spread the cost of investment.
112Figure 5.3: boost to employment predicted by NEMESIS
The contribution of foreign trade to the GDP gap between AMS2 and AME (negative until 2026
then increasingly positive thereafter, cf. figure 5.1 above) can be attributed to two phenomena:
• on the one hand, developments in competitiveness. The accelerated growth of the price
index, resulting from the significant, rapid upturn in economic activity between 2015 and
2020 (the price index stands 4.2% above its reference account benchmark in 2022), initially
leads to a deterioration in price competitiveness.  The level of exports thus falls in relation
to the level predicted in the AME scenario (AMS2 exports are 1.8% below the level of
exports in the AME scenario for the year 2022). Thereafter the surplus in the price index
subsides, because the activity surplus falls away and because energy savings come into
play. Exports thus come to stand at just 0.9% below the level seen in the trend-based
scenario in 2035.
• on the other hand, fluctuating imports. The significant increase in consumption early on in
this period leads to an increase in imports, aggravating the external trade deficit. In the
second period (from 2022 onwards), the surplus in domestic demand compared to the
trend-based scenario melts away (fewer imports of goods and services from overseas) and
energy savings drive down fossil fuel imports (particularly oil). The level of imports falls
back to 2.6% below the level seen in the trend-based scenario by the end of this period.
The decline of imports and rebound in competitiveness make foreign trade a decisive factor
in the overall macro-economic dynamic at the end of this period (contributing 0.6 points to
the GDP surplus of 1.3% in 2035).
Major investments in the AMS2 scenario compared with the AME scenario, in the building,
transport, energy and industrial sectors
In terms of total investment in construction,  the deviation from the trend-based scenario is
considerable: over €30 billion each year from 2017 to 2019, €40 to 45 billion in 2020 and 2021, and
€13-14 billion per annum throughout the rest of the period (2022-2035). The cumulative gap in
investment in construction between the reference scenario and the trend-based scenario is thus
equivalent to €390 billion for the period 2014-2035. If we were to remove the "500,000 new homes
between 2017 and 2021" target from the reference scenario, investment in construction would fall
113by €17 billion between 2017 and 2019, €26 billion in 2020 and €22 billion in 2021.
Investment in construction will be funded as follows:
Type of operation Stakeholder Nature of loans Level of borrowing
Renovation   of Average duration of loan: 33%   from   borrowing,
buildings   and Households 10 years remainder from available
heating systems Real interest rate 3% funds
67% from borrowing, the

Renovation   of Average duration of loan:
buildings   and Social housing 10 years 50% from borrowing

This additional investment (in the reference scenario, compared with the trend-based scenario) is
funded to the tune of 62% by households (€242 billion over the whole period 2014-2035), 20% by
tertiary sector businesses (€78 billion), 9.5% by the public tertiary sector (€37 billion) and 8.5% by
social housing authorities (€33 billion).
Figure 5.4: additional investment in construction (exogenous for NEMESIS)
Total surplus spending and investment in transport (investment in charging stations for electric
vehicles, high-speed train lines and urban public transport, investment by car manufacturers and
the surplus cost of buying electric vehicles), fluctuates around €3 billion per annum in the AME
114scenario (giving a cumulative total for surplus spending and investment of €63.9 billion over the
period 2014-2035), and between €4 and €6 billion per annum in AMS2 (cumulative total of €109.5
billion). For the period 2014-2035 as a whole, the total boost in surplus spending and investment
on transport is €46 billion (reference scenario compared with the trend-based scenario). The
annual gap between AMS2 and the trend-based scenario oscillates between €2.2 and €2.5 billion
in the period 2020-2030.
As for the industrial sectors,45 the reference scenario allows for additional investment of €1.9 billion
per annum (compared to the trend-based scenario) thanks to energy savings, spread across all
sectors of industry between 2015 and 2035 (€39.6 billion of cumulative investment across the
period). This investment will be concentrated primarily in the chemical (20%), food (23%) and
capital goods sectors.
To sum up, investment in buildings (renovation and construction) is the largest category of
investment, and thus has the greatest resonance in macro-economic terms. These are structurally-
significant investments and will have the greatest impact on the overall economic dynamic seen in
the reference scenario, compared with the trend-based scenario.
45 In the service sector, energy-saving investments are the fruit of investments made in tertiary buildings and not the
result of direct investments, as is the case in the industrial sector.
1153. Further analysis of the macro-economic impact of the AMS2 scenario as predicted by the
THREEME model
Figure 5.5: Evolution of the GDP gap and contribution of GDP aggregates (THREEME model)
In the forecast produced by the ADEME using the THREEME model, choosing the reference
scenario (AMS2) over the trend-based scenario (AME) leads to surplus investment equivalent to
+2.1 GDP points in 2021 (its peak), and a +1.6 point GDP boost in 2035.
Early on in this period, growth is primarily driven by investment. This leads to new jobs and an
increase in consumption, with a positive impact on activity. Job creation is robust in the early years
of this period. The increase in monthly repayment instalments induced by new construction
projects, and the crowding-out effect on consumption, is largely offset by the increase in total
earned income. Household consumption increases from 2015 onwards, making a vigorous,
positive contribution to growth.
The balance of trade is worse in AMS2 than in AME at the start of the period, as a result of
imported consumer goods. The gap between the trade balance forecasts in AMS2 and AME
narrows thereafter, but the contribution of foreign trade to the growth gap remains negative in both
scenarios. The rebound in imports of consumer goods and the reduction in companies’
competitiveness, resulting from the increase in energy prices, will cancel out the effects of the fall
in energy bills. Nonetheless, the balance of trade as a proportion of GDP will drop by 0.8 points in
2035.
Ultimately, it is job creation which will have the biggest effect on demand, and thus on GDP.
116Figure 5.6: boost to employment predicted by THREEME
The number of jobs created in new green sectors is greater than the number of jobs lost in the
fossil fuel sector and energy-intensive industries. In 2035, AMS2 sees the creation of almost
390 000 extra jobs compared to AME, with an annual average of 350,000 over the period 2015-
2035
1173. Impact on competitiveness
The gaps between these two models, and the array of concrete measures which could potentially
be taken to implement the SNBC strategy, do not allow us to make precise, sector-by-sector
forecasts for competitiveness.
The strategy will have certain negative effects on competitiveness, described and quantified in the
models detailed above (an increase in energy prices, a general price increase caused by the spike
in economic activity and the temporary postponement of the costs associated with the investments
required in each of the sectors concerned).
Measures will be taken to attenuate these negative effects. One notable measure is that the
carbon component of energy prices, set at €56/tCO  for 2020 and €100/tCO  for 2030, will not
2 2
apply to the sectors covered by the emissions trading scheme (ETS). Carbon pricing will therefore
not have a direct impact on the main industrial sectors which are most exposed to international
competition and most sensitive to energy prices.
Furthermore, the models detailed above look only at the effects of the French energy transition.
The relative decline in French competitiveness needs to be reframed in the European and
international context, as our economic partners will need to implement similar policies. The
introduction of a carbon guide price in the main non-European economies would allow for a fair
system of incentives at international level, and France would benefit from the surplus demand
coming from international clients.
Positive effects on competitiveness can also be detected in the macro-economic analyses.
On the one hand, energy savings will drive down production costs in the long term. On the other
hand, the investments required by the energy transition will encourage companies to truly get to
grips with technologies allowing them to reduce their consumption and emissions, as well as
finding alternatives to fossil fuels. This will give French businesses a head start in tomorrow's
global market for low-carbon energy technology.
In order to foster this dynamic, support for innovation will be one of the key priorities of the
ecological transition. France's goal - which is also the EU's objective - is to create new clusters of
excellence in energy efficiency, renewable energies and low-carbon technologies.
Ultimately, the macro-economic analyses which have been conducted thus far agree on the fact
that the overall economic impact of the AMS2 reference scenario (compared with the AME
scenario), although difficult to quantify exactly, is positive for both growth and employment.
1184. Abatement cost curve
An abatement cost curve (ACC) is a planning tool designed to compare different potential ways of
reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, identifying the methods which will allow us to achieve
our stated reduction target by a given deadline and in the most cost-efficient manner. The
construction of these curves, on a sectoral or aggregated scale, is based on estimating costs in
comparison to a reference scenario predicting the evolution of greenhouse gas emissions.
Each of the potential mitigation technologies/measures is then judged on its: (i) speed of
deployment, (ii) potential to reduce emissions, (iii) the time-frame of the stated objective and (iv)
cost in relation to an average comparable technology as modelled in the reference scenario.
The quality of the database used to create an ACC is crucial. This database should be the fruit of
transparent, open discussions between stakeholders to ensure that the resulting ACC is pertinent.
The idea is to allow for useful comparison between different options.
The key messages delivered by assessment and guidance tools such as the ACC are as follows:
 They allow us to represent, on a single graph and for a given period of time (see below), the
uptake scenarios for different potential methods of reducing emissions, along with their cost.
Analysing these curves allows us to evaluate all the technological solutions modelled and
the extent to which they contribute to the achievement of our mitigation objectives.
 They allow us to identify actions which would be directly profitable (i.e. have negative costs),
which are not always immediately obvious (lack of information, changing costs, discount rate
differences in the private and public sectors) and which should be deployed as soon as
possible (e.g. Option A in Fig. x)
 We must take care to ensure that the emission reduction measures implemented with a view
to achieving intermediate targets do not induce a form of technological lock-in which will be
harmful in the long term. Options selected in the short term should help us to prepare for the
next steps, reducing costs and maximising joint benefits.
 The ACC allows us to distinguish between costly technologies with slow uptake (Option C)
which will need to be implemented at the same time as technologies with low (or even
negative) abatement costs (Option A) and before options with lower costs but quicker uptake
(Option B), in order to meet our long-term objective. The ACC allow us to put the different
emissions reduction options into perspective.
119These curves may also be usefully applied to different sectors of activity. For example, an ACC
was drawn up for the agricultural sector by the INRA, for the purposes of the study 'What
contribution   can   French   agriculture   make   to   the   reduction   of   greenhouse   gas
emissions?' published in 2013.46 This curve contains a forecast for mitigation potential up until
2030, as well as the estimated mitigation cost of each of the sub-measures identified. The curve
does not specify the speed with which these sub-measures will be implemented, but the
momentum predicted for the period 2010-2030 is the fruit of systematic analysis.
This curve demonstrates that many of the actions envisaged by the SNBC correspond to measures
with low or even negative costs: reducing doses of mineral inputs, improving energy efficiency,
developing legume crops, adjusting animal feed portions etc. We must also bear in mind that some
of the sub-measures with the highest mitigation costs are already actively encouraged by the CAP
(particularly the goal of protecting ecological resources such as hedgerows and grassy areas);
these actions have joint benefits which must also be taken into account when assessing their
pertinence.

Finally, although the ACC is a powerful analytical tool (as well as being much more pertinent than
simply looking at the static marginal abatement cost, an indicator which is often cited), when
choosing between different options we also need to take into account some elements which the
curve does not cover: joint benefits or clashes between these measures and other policy objectives
(secondary environmental impact, economic development, usage value of different assets,
acceptability etc.). The ACC alone does not allow us to accurately prioritise the measures to be
taken.

120ii. Analysis of the social impact in terms of equitable 
redistribution
In the long term, investment in renovation will be compensated by savings on household
energy bills
The reference scenario for the energy transition (known as AMS2) involves more renovation work
than the trend-based scenario (AME) (a total of 29.8 million renovation operations on existing
buildings in the period 2015-2028, compared to 19.1 million in the trend-based scenario). The
nature of this renovation work is also more ambitious in the reference scenario (in which 45% of
projects involve at least two forms of renovation, which is only the case for 20% of projects in the
trend-based scenario). Last but not least, the reference scenario includes a carbon price signal
which makes fossil fuels more expensive than they would be in the trend-based scenario.
For the period 2015-2028, investments in renovation should reach €24 billion in the reference
scenario, compared with €16 billion in the trend-based scenario. These investments will be spread
out somewhat unevenly: in the reference scenario, renovation investment is predicted to be €23
billion per year for 2015-2018, then €25 billion per year for 2019-2023 and €24 billion per year for
2024-2028, whereas the trend-based scenario forecasts a decline in renovation investment from
€16 billion per year in the period 2015-2023 to €15 billion per year in 2024-2028.
The average spend on renovation work in existing homes is estimated at around €955 per year in
the reference scenario, which is almost €345 per year more than the figure predicted by the
trend-based scenario. This investment surplus in comparison to the trend-based scenario will
fluctuate over time, in line with the rate of renovation and the level of income of residents:
• in 2015-2018, the reference scenario expects renovation work to generate an average
investment of around €275 per year, diverging from the trend-based scenario. The majority
of these investments are likely to involve homes occupied by families in the upper deciles
of the "standard of living" scale (5th decile and above).47 The renovation surplus predicted
by the reference scenario, is derived primarily from individual homes, which are generally
occupied by households in the upper income brackets. In the homes occupied by the most
well-off households (top three deciles), annual investment should average €320 more than
the trend-based scenario. Surplus investment by lower-income households (bottom three
deciles) is expected to be around €225 per annum.
- in the period 2019-2023, the increase in renovation work in all categories of home is
expected to generate surplus investment of around €390 per year, compared with the trend-
based scenario. This surplus investment will be slightly lower in homes occupied by lower-
income households (an average of €375 per year for households in the first three deciles).
The level of investment will depend on the size of the home involved, which naturally
means that lower-income households spend less, as they have smaller homes. For homes
occupied by households in the top three deciles, surplus investment should be around €420
per year;
- in 2024-2028 the average investment surplus should be less substantial, at €355 per year
above the trend-based scenario, being concentrated primarily on homes occupied by lower-
income households (an average of €380 per year for the bottom three deciles) and less on
47 The deciles referred to here are measurements of standard of living. A household's standard of living is defined as its total disposable
income divided by the number of consumption units in the household. All members of the same household are thus considered to have
the same standard of living.
121homes occupied by the wealthiest households (average of €345 per year for the top three
deciles). This difference can be partly ascribed to the differing rates renovation for different
types of home: renovation on apartment blocks and social housing are more concentrated
in this period, compared to work on individual homes.
In total, for all renovation work and as compared with the trend-based scenario the average
investment surplus of €345 per year across the period as a whole should actually correspond to
lower spending on homes occupied by low and middle-income families, spread relatively evenly
across the scale (averaging €335 for the bottom seven deciles). Spending by higher-income
households will be greater, given the size of the homes to be renovated (average of €365 per
year).
As the purpose of these renovations is to make homes more energy-efficient, all other factors
being equal they should help to reduce heat consumption, and thus drive down energy bills. At the
same time, carbon signal-prices will make carbonised energy sources more expensive, nudging
heating bills upwards. The actual impact on energy bills will thus depend on the scale of the
renovation work, the initial condition of the home (energy performance, size), the type of heating
system installed and the level of carbon pricing.
As the energy efficiency savings made possible by renovation work are greater than the increase
in energy bills caused by rising carbon prices,  as an average over the period and, in
comparison with the trend-based scenario, the savings made on heating bills should be
around €130 per year for households in existing homes. In the period 2015-2018, these
savings should be no more than €30 per year compared with the trend-based scenario, as energy
consumption reductions from renovation just about manage to offset the increase in the cost of
carbonised energies caused by carbon signal prices. In 2019-2023, however, the dynamism of
energy renovations should see a clear reduction in bills. Household should save an average of
€140 per year, rising to €200 in 2024-2028. Over the period 2015-2028, the average saving of
€130 per year and per household should be less substantial for lower-income households (an
average of €90 per year) because they have smaller homes. As a proportion of annual heating
bills, these savings will be relatively evenly spread across the deciles, equivalent to an average
reduction of 10% on the heating bill predicted by the trend-based scenario 15% for the three lowest
deciles).
In the reference scenario - taking into account the fact that the energy savings made possible by
renovations outlast the duration of the work, and that the rise of carbon prices will increase the
sums saved - investment in renovation is eventually compensated by the savings made on heating
bills. Specifically, the surplus of €345 in renovation investment predicted by the reference
scenario for the period 2015-2028 should be fully offset by savings on heating bills by 2033-
2034, compared with the cost of heating without renovations. This abatement time is identical
for all homes, regardless of the standard of living of the household.
It should be noted that the investments considered here are connected directly to the homes
receiving the renovation work, regardless of who actually pays for the work (the occupant or, in
other cases, the landlord, or even the taxpayer via public subsidies). In practice, home-owners with
lower incomes will be less likely to undertake renovation work as they have less access to credit,
due to the fact that the investment involved represents a greater share of their income than it does
for other households. The 'Habiter Mieux' (Better Living) programme launched by the Agence
Nationale de l'Habitat, combined with the third-party financing system, should nonetheless help to
remove these obstacles. There is also a high proportion of renters among these households48
48 The impact this will have on individual decision-making is hard to determine with any certainty: a programme of energy
renovation for a large social housing complex involves a relatively small number of decision-makers, but convincing
small landlords is, at least in theory, a harder task. Hence the option included in the Energy Transition and Green Growth
122Finally, potential rebound effects linked with improved energy efficiency have not been taken into
account, particularly the potential for substitution effects between spending on heating and other
forms of energy.
Fuel spending should fall because there will be fewer vehicles on the road, travelling
shorter distances and running more efficiently.
The total number of vehicles on the road in the reference scenario is slightly lower than the figure
given in the trend-based scenario (300,000 fewer vehicles in 2035 in the reference scenario, with
2.7   million   fewer   petrol   and   diesel   vehicles   and   2.4   million   more   electric   cars   and
hybrids). Furthermore, the vehicles included in the reference scenario are more efficient (in the
reference scenario, a petrol-fuelled vehicle uses 3.8 litres of fuel per 100 km in 2035, compared
with 5.9 litres in the trend-based scenario) and travel shorter distances (average distance travelled
annually by a petrol vehicle = 8,600 km in 2035 in the reference scenario, compared with 10,900
km in the trend-based scenario).
This has an impact on household spending on fuel, and the conditions sketched out in the
reference scenario with regard to the evolution of automobile performance and usage are factors
liable to drive down fuel consumption, compared with the trend-based scenario. The increase in
fossil fuel prices, caused by the introduction of carbon pricing, will be offset by the fall in
consumption. In 2015-2018, annual household spending on fuel should be €125 less than in the
trend-based scenario. This fall in fuel spending should pick up pace thereafter, as the
characteristics of vehicles on our roads change: €165 per year in the period 2019-2023, then €330
each year from 2024 to 2028.
Over the period 2015-2028, and for all households, average fuel savings should be
equivalent to €215 per year, an 11% saving compared to the trend-based scenario.
The impact of the reference scenario on investment in individual transport equipment has not been
estimated precisely with reference to levels of living standards.49 As a result, the evolution of
transport habits (number of vehicles per household, fuel efficiency, distance travelled) has been
uniformly applied to all households while retaining the relative distribution between deciles, which
are held to be stable over time. As such, savings on fuel spending are almost uniformly spread
across the deciles (an 11% saving across the period 2015-2028 compared with the trend-based
scenario, regardless of living standards). In absolute terms, the savings made on fuel spending are
much less substantial for lower-income households (€145 per year for the lowest three deciles in
2015-2028) and much higher for the richest households (€290 per year for the top three deciles
over the period 2015-2028). Compared with other households, lower-income households have
fewer vehicles and travel shorter distances.
Act of introducing a bonus-malus scheme (Art. 14 VIII).
49 It should be noted that the macro-economic forecasts used to construct these scenarios are based on the assumption
that options inducing spending increases and decreases will offset one another: stricter performance criteria for
manufacturers may drive car prices up, but the increase in fuel prices (coupled with the rise of biofuels) may prompt
households to opt for smaller vehicles. Furthermore, the development of lift sharing and car sharing may serve to reduce
the total number of vehicles on the road. The combined result of these different phenomena is hard to evaluate with
reference to household living standards.

125iii. Environmental challenges and public health issues
Combined benefits and points to be watched closely
This is a qualitative approach.
We have methodically reviewed the main ways in which the first three carbon budgets (and, more
generally, the implementation of the low-carbon strategy) are liable to raise environmental issues
other than the central question of attenuating the effects of climate change. The definition of
environmental issues applied here is broad, and extends to questions of public health.
In this section, we explore the main joint benefits (other than climate change mitigation) and points
to be watched, with a view to ensuring that they are taken into consideration in the sectoral plans
and programmes, with further reflection where required.
1. Energy efficiency and renewable energies: reducing the use of fossil fuels
The joint benefits of this action are significant: reducing the consumption of fossil fuels would help
to reduce the environmental and health-related consequences of their usage, but also their
extraction, transportation, transformation and distribution. The impact and damage done by fossil
and fissile fuel extraction could thus be reduced in France and internationally.
Nor should we forget the reduced risk of accidental pollution linked to fossil fuel extraction (oil
contamination, polluted soils), transportation (oil spills, illegal gas purging) and transformation (air
and water pollution).
◦ Insulation of buildings
This measure will have beneficial health effects in summer and winter, for example by ensuring
that vulnerable people are better protected during heat waves.
Insulation can lead to a deterioration of interior air quality if the accompanying ventilation system is
poorly-designed or defective. This risk should be minimised by the fact that, in order to qualify for
the sustainable development tax credit, the work must be performed by an RGE-certified
professional (an environmental quality label). Renovating old buildings may in fact provide an
opportunity to improve interior air quality. It is important that health concerns should be at the heart
of our renovation policy, along with energy efficiency and climate change mitigation.
The campaign to renovate heat insulation in French homes will lead to an increase in waste from
the construction sector and an increase in the demand for insulation materials.
2. Transport
◦ Managing demand, shifting to other modes of transport and 
optimising logistics
These measures will allow us to minimise the negative side-effects of transport (noise, atmospheric
pollution, health problems), infrastructure and parking problems (freeing up space).
They will also help to reduce energy consumption, and particularly consumption of fossil fuels (cf.
energy efficiency section above).
◦ Electric vehicles
126Electrification has significant joint benefits in terms of reducing noise and atmospheric pollution,
which is a real boon for urban areas.
Nonetheless, one aspect of this development will need to be monitored closely. Increasing
consumption, mining and transformation of mineral resources may have serious environmental
consequences (lithium, cobalt etc.). In some cases, there may be conflicts over land use for
agriculture or mining. Nevertheless, we can reduce these impacts by developing more efficient
systems for collecting and recycling used materials, optimising the design of equipment and
products and ensuring that the raw materials we use are sourced from mining operations using the
best available technology.
◦ Gas-powered vehicles
Replacing traditional fuels with gas can have significant benefits in terms of respiratory health and
atmospheric pollution.
We nevertheless need to be careful with regard to the sources of biogas, as their chemical
composition will vary depending on the source material used. They may require preliminary
analyses or treatments, or at least regular checks.
◦ Active mobility
As well as helping us to limit demand for motorised transport (cf. above), active mobility brings
obvious health benefits, as physical exercise can reduce the risk of numerous health problems.
3. The circular economy and bio-sourcing, agriculture, forestry
◦ The circular economy and recycling: cutting down on our use of 
mineral resources.
In the long term, limiting our use of the planet's mineral resources will be a necessary priority. Our
strategy is constructed accordingly, with its focus on energy efficiency, the bio-based economy, the
circular economy and the systematic promotion of reuse and recycling. This is one of the clear joint
benefits of our policy. (The development of some renewable energy sources will nonetheless
require additional resources, which will need to be optimised, cf. hereunder)
◦ Greater use of biomass and the circular economy
The SNBC promotes the development of bio-based materials and more widespread use of
biomass for energy purposes (biogas and solid biomass, particularly for heating, as well as
second-generation biofuels) and for material purposes (e.g. in manufacturing to create wholly or
partially bio-based products).
Changing the way we use biomass and agricultural materials will naturally have consequences for
the corresponding ecosystems. In accordance with Objective 12 of the National Biodiversity
Strategy, ensuring the sustainable use of biological resources is an essential priority. Securing this
sustainability will require us to find a coherent way to juggle the challenges listed in the following
paragraphs.
◦ Use of biomass for non-alimentary purposes: agricultural impact
This strategy does not include a huge increase the amount of agricultural land dedicated to non-
food uses, and recommends the use of catch crops wherever possible. First-generation biofuels
and other fuels which represent competition for food should be subject to restrictions (both
127nationally and at EU level). This will allow us to manage competition for agricultural land and
minimise the potential direct and indirect impact of changing land uses on an international scale.
Promoting the methanisation of manure, leftover crops, catch crops and bio-waste will also help
minimise competition between 'methanisation' as a revenue source and other agricultural uses.
However, phytosanitary products are sometimes required to destroy catch crops: keeping these
products under strict control is a key priority, in accordance with the 'Ecophyto' strategy.
◦ Development of legume crops
Use of legumes in crop rotation can help to reduce the need for mineral fertilisers, and thus reduce
the pollution - and energy consumption - connected with their production, transport and spreading.
By regulating the level of nitrogen present in the soil, legumes help to improve soil quality and
reduce the leakage of nitrogen into the water table.
Moreover, their melliferous properties attract pollinating insects, and thus help to ensure the
pollination of other crops.
◦ Development of hedgerows
The guideline target is to hit 700,000 ha of hedgerows by 2035, up from the current figure of
500,000.  
Hedgerows help to protect the soil (reducing erosion by wind and water). They are an essential
element of our landscape. They also represent an irreplaceable habitat and source of biodiversity.
◦ Sustainable forestry management
This means making sure that forestry resources are renewed effectively, and planning ahead to
deal with increased pressure on natural resources (soils, water, biodiversity). Regular, increased
demand for forestry biomass should not lead to a drop in soil fertility. Forestry management
methods must limit the impact on the soil (with particular attention paid to the risk of subsidence).
Certain soil additives may be useful of even necessary (ash, for example), as long as they are non-
toxic and used in such a manner as to avoid leakage into the water table.
If forest residues are to be used for other purposes, we must still take care to leave a sufficient
quantity of dead wood in situ for the sake of biodiversity (habitat and food, particularly when
reducing the quantity of forest residues) (Bio2, 2009). Certain practices can help us to reduce the
negative impact of removing dead wood, such as delayed collection in order to reduce the loss of
food sources (Bio2, 2009).
Changes in the structure and composition of forestry resources can represent both an opportunity
and a challenge, and we must ensure that forestry management is sensitive to the need to
preserve biodiversity (particularly the diversity of habitats) and the landscape.
In this respect, it is important to distinguish between domestic and international effects. For the
time being, pressure on forestry resources is under control in France thanks to a long-standing
legal framework. But we must remain vigilant, especially since use of these resources is expected
to increase significantly. At the international level, and since there is no system in place to monitor
the sustainability of global forestry management practices, the indirect impact of imports can be
significant, depending on the origin of the wood in question. With some developed economies
forecasting rapid growth in their imports, this issue will require particular attention.
It should also be noted that importing wood increases the risk of spreading diseases and
pathogens (risk level depends on the quality of the wood).
◦ Highly-intensive forestry practices - a special case
High-intensity forestry operations (short or very short rotation coppice) require detailed preliminary
128studies to avoid the use of phytosanitary products or fertilisers. These studies must also take into
account the possible effects on water resources (interception, transpiration) and drainage basins
(maintaining minimum flow rates).
The use of invasive plant species requires specific advance studies and reinforced monitoring.
◦ The carbon impact of using forestry biomass - carbon debt or 
investment
Using timber from the forest leads to a temporary decrease in the carbon stored by the living trees.
In the short term, this carbon release is greater than the reduction in emissions made possible by
avoiding fossil fuels. We thus end up with an excess of carbon in the atmosphere, compared with
an alternative scenario in which the wood is left where it is and we burn fossil fuels instead. This
excess is known as a carbon investment or debt. If forestry management respects the principles of
sustainability and ensures that resources are protected and renewed, this carbon debt is only
temporary - generally in the order of several decades - and will be more than compensated by a
positive long-term climate impact. Furthermore, this positive impact can be repeated in the next
forestry cycle. Carbon debt is therefore not a major concern from a climate perspective, as long as
forestry resources are managed sustainably. Moreover, effective forestry management allows us to
support the adaptation of ecosystems and stave off certain natural risks, including risks aggravated
by climate change (drought and forest fires, for example, or parasite infestations). Finally, when
forestry by-products are used correctly the carbon debt is substantially reduced and its
"repayment" time becomes extremely short.
4. Development of renewable energies
◦ Energy from wood
When not burned fully, using wood as a source of heating represents a risk for respiratory health
and air quality, emitting harmful atmospheric pollutants.
The widespread installation of modern heating equipment to replace old boilers (and especially
open fireplaces) has allowed us to drastically reduce these emissions, representing one of the
major secondary benefits of improvements in heating technology (and sometimes the main
objective).
The use of wood for heating also creates large quantities of ash, which is rich in nutrients but can
present certain risks when not effectively managed. We need to take these risks into consideration
in order to make wood a sustainable energy source.
◦ Methanisation
Methanisation is a process allowing us to recover the biogas naturally emitted by farm waste, using
some of this biowaste to produce energy and also fertilise soils. Methanisation does not reduce the
raw quantity of nitrogen contained in animal effluents, but it converts this nitrogen into a digestate
form which is more easily absorbed by plants. Spreading these digestates can limit the need for
mineral fertilisers.
However, the nitrogen contained in these digestates is also more volatile, and methanisation can
thus lead to an increase in gaseous ammonia emissions (and nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse
gas of which ammonia can be a precursor) as a result of raw effluents being replaced with
digestate fertilisers. Further research is needed into the potential impact of this process, and to
identify potential technological solutions.
129◦ Wind power
The development of onshore wind farms may place pressure on biodiversity (birds, bats etc.). The
noise generated can disturb ecosystems. Turbines also change the landscape.
Developing wind power also requires us to increase our consumption of certain minerals needed to
construct the corresponding infrastructure. Some of these mineral resources (rare earth elements)
carry supply risks (particularly for offshore facilities), and their production (including mining)
induces serious environmental damage (emissions of pollutants into the air, water and soils,
significant quantities of waste etc.). These effects may be attenuated by using raw materials from
mines using the best technologies on the market, but particularly by developing effective networks
for the collection and recycling of materials from obsolete products.
Wind farms can also have beneficial effects on local biodiversity. For example, offshore wind farms
can create habitats for some species of marine life. Furthermore, it is worth putting the
environmental impact of wind turbines into some perspective. For example, the number of birds
killed in collisions with wind turbines is tiny compared to the number of birds (from the same
species) killed every year by pet cats, windows or power lines.
◦ Solar power
Photovoltaic power cells are relatively intensive in terms of the materials required for their
manufacture, in comparison to other forms of energy generation.
The mining and preparation of the raw materials required to produce this equipment (particularly
photovoltaic cells) have an impact on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (releasing toxic
substances). Solar panels also take up space, and may induce the artificialisation of soils or
modifications to habitats and biodiversity. Using spaces which are already developed (e.g. the
roofs of buildings) or restricted (industrial risks) can substantially reduce this impact.
◦ Transport networks and the electrical grid
The development of intermittent renewable energy sources in France and across Europe as a
whole, particularly wind and solar power, will require significant modifications to the existing
electricity distribution networks. Depending on their specific properties, these technologies are
subject to environmental impact assessments to help limit any damage done.
◦ Hydroelectric power
The production of hydroelectricity, even on a small scale, has an impact on the hydrological and
sedimentary functions of watercourses (disturbing natural flow, reducing morphogenetic factors,
sedimentary deficits etc.) as well as biological functions (aquatic milieus and habitats) in immediate
proximity to the power facility, and also further up and down the ecological chain (disrupting the
movements of invertebrates and fish, shifting sediment deposits etc.).
In watercourses frequented by highly migratory species (salmon, sea trout, shad, eels etc.) the
impact of these different obstacles is cumulative (D4E, 2002). The installation of small hydro
facilities therefore does have an impact, even when measures are taken to provide safe passage.
The operation and maintenance of dams also has certain effects.
The development of hydro power must be managed with reference to the framework directive on
water resources.
1305.3. Evolutions in greenhouse gas emissions, 1990-2013
A study commissioned by the Ministry for Ecology in 2015 and conducted by CITEPA/CEREN
provides an analysis of national greenhouse gas emissions in Metropolitan France between 1990
and 2013 (for all sectors), and since 1960 for sectors connected to energy by a certain number of
determining factors. A more detailed summary is given as an appendix. The main findings of the
study are presented here.
This study allowed us to:
1. identify the main parameters influencing the developments observed in each sector;
2. better comprehend the relationship between the evolution of these parameters and
variations in emissions.
Between 1990 and 2013, total GHG emissions (exc. changes to land usage and forestry) fell by
12.3% in Metropolitan France as a result of:
1. on the one hand, an 11.7% increase in emissions from the transport sector, 5.9% in the
residential-tertiary sector and 11.1% in the waste management sector;
2. on the other hand, emissions fell by 39.8% in the manufacturing sector, 30.9% in the
industrial energy sector, and 6.1% in agriculture/forestry.
These sectoral developments need to be weighted to take into account the contribution of each
sector to overall greenhouse gas emissions. Fluctuations bucking the general trend were observed
during this period, particularly under the impact of certain government policies.
The sector-by-sector results are as follows:
- Transport sector
Since 1990, emissions from the transport sector have increased by 11.1% (from 118.3 MtCO eq in
2
1990) to reach 131.4 MtCO eq in 2013. Road transport made the biggest contribution (92% of
2
greenhouse gas emissions), followed by air travel (3% of greenhouse gas emissions) and maritime
transport (1% of greenhouse gas emissions).
On the roads, the development of biofuels served to reduce emissions, along with a decrease in
per-vehicle fuel consumption and the reduction of average speeds. However, increases in
distances travelled, population growth, number of vehicles per capita and road freight combined to
push emissions upwards. Nevertheless, it is not easy to clearly determine the influence of other
factors such as average fuel prices, the distribution of passengers between private vehicles, buses
and trains, the extension of urbanised areas and the average age of vehicles on the road.
131Between 1960 and 1990, greenhouse gas emissions grew steadily along with the volume of traffic
per capita (traffic effect), with the exception of periods of economic crisis such as 1974 and 2008.
Meanwhile, the fall in the average unitary consumption of vehicles on the road (the miles-to-the-
gallon effect), which has improved over the years, partly as a result of European and national
policies (bonus-malus schemes, European regulations limiting CO  emissions for new cars etc.),
2
has helped to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The gradual introduction of biofuels (% fossil
sources) has contributed to the decrease in greenhouse gas emissions since 2005. Sustained
population growth between 1960 and 1990 (the population effect) pushed greenhouse gas
emissions upwards, but not as significantly as traffic. The emissions factor (GHG Emi / Cons)
caused emissions to increase slightly.
Greenhouse gas emissions from the aviation sector have increased since 1990, peaking at 4.7
MtCO eq in 2000. They then declined steadily until 2010, stabilising at just under 4MtCO eq. The
2 2
first period (1990-2000), marked by favourable economic conditions, saw an increase in tourism
and commercial passenger numbers, leading to an increase in emissions. Air traffic slowed in the
second period (2001-2013), and so did emissions, as passengers turned to alternative means of
transportation, in a context rendered less favourable by increasing oil prices. The opening of new
high-speed rail lines (the Mediterranean LGV) may have encouraged passengers to take the train
instead of the plane.
- The agricultural sector
Between 1990 and 2013, emissions from arable crops fell by 8.4%. This was primarily a result of
changes in nitrogen use and the economic circumstances affecting the sector. Some public policies
may also have contributed to the fall in emissions, such as the nitrates directive and certain
132subsidies offered by the second pillar of the CAP. Since 2000, increases in fertiliser prices may
also have contributed to the decline in emissions. The decline in cultivated surface areas and a
tricky economic context can partly explain the downturn in farm emissions in this period, even as
crop output continued to increase.
Over the period 1990-2013, emissions from farming fell by 6.5%. These emissions come primarily
from cattle. Over the period in question, the total number of cattle in France fell while dairy yields
increased. These developments should be seen in the context of the restructuring of the dairy
sector (milk quotas introduced in 1984), the dairy premium and CAP reform. As for the
management of cattle effluents, we have moved from a system dominated by manure use to a
more even balance of manure and slurry, reflecting the structural evolution of cattle farms and the
gradual disappearance of small herds.  Although slurry systems generate more emissions, overall
emissions from animal waste have remained relatively stable as changing uses have been
balanced out by the general decline in cattle numbers. Meanwhile, the development of
methanisation techniques has contributed to a reduction in emissions from the sector.
The current economic state of the sector (which has shrunk over the course of this period) and the
rising prices of production inputs have also contributed to this fall in emissions. This is borne out by
the IPAMPA animal feed indicator (index for the average purchase price of agricultural inputs),
which has increased over the period in question.
- The waste management sector
Emissions from waste management increased by nearly 10% over the period 1990-2013 (16.8.
MtCO eq in 1990, 18.4 MtCO eq in 2013) to represent 4% of total greenhouse gas emissions in
2 2
2013. The increase in the quantity of waste generated per capita initially had an inflationary effect
on greenhouse gas emissions (between 1991 and 2000), and then a deflationary effect (between
2001 and 2013) as per capita waste began to decline. Greenhouse gas emissions per unit of waste
produced increased until 1995, and have fallen since. This may reflect the increase in the rate of
emissions captured since the late 1990s.
• The residential-tertiary sector
Between 1960 and 2013, direct GHG emissions from energy consumption in the residential and
tertiary buildings increased by 77%, from 49 million tonnes to 86.6 million tonnes. The evolution of
these emissions has involved several distinct phases. Demographic developments, economic
activity, changes in heating habits, energy prices, environmental issues and the government
policies which take them into account, thermal regulations and household reactions, as well as the
evolution of the energy mix and varying GHG emission from different energy sources have all had
an impact on the overall level of emissions.
With the exception of demographic factors, which have had a steady impact on the level of GHG
emissions, all of the other factors listed above have influenced fluctuations in emissions to varying
extents at different periods.
The sub-period 1960-1975 saw strong economic growth (an average of 5.2% per annum) and low
energy prices. The sub-period 1975-1990 was marked by the effects of the 1973 oil crisis, at a time
when economic growth was strong but not as strong as it had been in the preceding period
(average annual growth of 2.7% between 1975 and 1990). The sub-period 1990-2002 saw prices
fall in constant currency, as growth remained strong (average 2% p.a.). The sub-period 2002-2013
saw a sharp increase in energy prices, and a slowdown in economic growth (average 1.1% p.a.,
with recession in 2008-2009). This sub-period also saw the gradual introduction of new thermal
regulations for housing, with notable reforms in 2000 and 2005.
133 The residential sector
We analysed emissions from the energy consumption in the residential sector by breaking down
their effects. The results (in MtCO eq) are presented in the graph below.
2
Between 1990 and 2013, direct GHG emissions induced by the consumption of energy were
virtually stable ('total variation'). "Stock" and "energy efficiency" effects ("efficiency_balance"50)
were dominant and cancelled one another out (an average annual increase of +1.1% greenhouse
gas emissions as a result of the former, and a -1.5% decrease attributable to the latter).
The "energy efficiency" effect saw a strong increase between 2002 and 2013, and thus had a
positive influence on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (annual average of -2.5%;
compared with -0.5% in the period 1990-2002). In the first period, fuel prices were relatively stable
in constant currency. They increased sharply in the second period. The combination of these
circumstances and successive waves of thermal regulations provided an incentive for energy
efficiency efforts in the second period. Over the period 1990-2013 as a whole, better insulation of
buildings accounted for around half of the improvement in energy efficiency, though this figure
fluctuated over time: it accounted for all of the progress made in the period 1990-2002, and around
a third of efficiency gains made in 2002-2013.
Over the period as a whole, the climate effect served to limit greenhouse gas emissions (-0.5% per
year on average). The first few years were milder than the years toward the end of the period (only
two years were recorded as being cooler than average), leading to a 2.8% annual decrease in
greenhouse gas emissions between 1990 and 2002. Between 2002 and 2013, climate effects saw
50 The "efficiency balance" effect in the residential sector is the difference between the total variation in emissions as
calculated by CEREN and the sum total of effects such as housing stock, climate conditions, electric heating, energy mix
and insulation. The discrepancy here is the result of differences in the calculation methods used by CITEPA and
CEREN.
134emissions increase by 1.5% each year. Four of those years saw cold winters, including 2010 which
was particularly harsh. Unlike the tertiary sector, the overall impact of climate effects in the period
1990-2013 was to drive emissions down.
The contribution of changes in the energy mix to the reduction of GHG emissions is estimated at
-0.2% p.a. over the period 1990-2013. This contribution fluctuated over the course of the period:
the decline in wood burning between 1990 and 2002 more than balanced out the gains made
possible by increased use of gas. The energy mix effect actually increased emissions by an
average of 0.4% each year between 1990 and 2002, after which the gains made possible by the
rise of wood and gas led to a significant reduction in overall emissions (-0.9% p.a. between 2002
and 2013).
The effect of replacing combustible fuel-powered heating with electric alternatives helped to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by an average of -0.5% per year between 1990 and 2013, under the
combined effect of a decline in unitary consumption and a reduced average GHG content. This
reduction was more substantial in the latter period as a result of the accelerated uptake of electric
heating (34% market share in 2013, up from 28% in 2002 and 26% in 1990). This acceleration has
been driven largely by the installation of heat pumps in private homes since the mid-2000s.
• The tertiary sector
As with the residential sector, we analysed emissions from energy consumption in the tertiary
sector by breaking down their effects. The results (in MtCO eq) are presented in the graph below.
2
Direct GHG emissions were relatively stable between 1990 and 2013.  "Stock" and "energy
efficiency" effects ("efficiency_balance"51) had a major impact on the evolution of emissions. The
impact of the energy efficiency effect was amplified between 2002 and 2013 (annual average
-2.2%) compared to the preceding period (-0.1% p.a. between 1990 and 2002).
The stock effect was a dominant force, though it fell from an annual average of 1.7% in 1990-2002
to 1.4% in 2002-2013. Over the period 1990-2013 as a whole, the climate effect led to an increase
in greenhouse gas emissions: +0.3% per year on average, with variations over the course of this
period (-0.5% per year between 1990 and 2002 then +1.2% per year between 2002 and 2012).
51This effect is calculated as the difference between the total variation in emissions and the sum total of effects such as building stock, climate
conditions, electric heating, structure etc. The "methodology deviation" effect accounts for discrepancies arising from differences in the calculation
methods used by CITEPA and CEREN, and differences in the scope of studies focusing on the tertiary sector.
135The evolution of the energy mix was favourable to natural gas, at the expense of domestic heating
oil.   This helped to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 0.3% per annum between
1990 and 2013. The impact of increased use of electric heating is estimated at -0.4% p.a. in the
period 1990-2013. Replacing combustible fuel-powered heating with electric alternatives helps to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions thanks to the combined effect of a decline in unitary
consumption and a reduced average GHG content. Over the period 1990-2013 as a whole, the
effects of energy efficiency measures  had a positive impact on reducing greenhouse gas
emissions estimated at -1.1% per year on average. This impact varied over time: -0.1% per year
between 1990 and 2002, then -2.2% per year between 2002 and 2013. It is worth noting that fuel
prices fell during the first period (in constant currency), before increasing substantially in the
second period, a development which undoubtedly provided extra impetus for energy efficiency
efforts. Furthermore, since the turn of the millennium thermal regulations have been extended to
the tertiary sector, increasing overall energy efficiency in this sector with new buildings and thermal
renovation of existing stock.
• Factors explaining the evolution of direct and indirect GHG emissions from energy
consumption in the residential-tertiary sector
Analysing indirect emissions allows us to take into account the effects of electricity consumption,
particularly the impact of average GHG emissions per kWh of electricity, the impact of air
conditioning and the impact of other specific uses.
The following section looks at total (direct and indirect) emissions from the energy consumption in
the residential and tertiary sectors over the period 1990-2013.
Residential buildings
The   evolution   of   "average
GHG emissions per kWh of
electricity" led to a significant
fall in emissions:
-10.7 Mt CO eq between 1990
2
and 2013.
This   reduction   was
concentrated in the first sub-
period:
-9.0   Mt   between   1990   and
2002, due to the milder climate
conditions.
The   effects   of   specific
electricity   consumption   were
limited, as a result of the low
GHG   content   of   this
consumption.
136Tertiary buildings
The reduction in average GHG
emissions   per   kWh   of
electricity helped drive down
emissions   by   5.7   MtCO eq
2
between 1990 and 2013.
The spread of air conditioning
had   a   limited   impact   on
emissions due to its low GHG
content.
The effect of specific uses was
almost nil between 2002 and
2013, as a result of improved
energy   efficiency   in   lighting
and office equipment.
• The industrial sector
Between 1960 and 2013, direct GHG emissions from energy use in industry were virtually halved,
shrinking from 105.2 million tonnes to 62.7 million tonnes, after peaking at 137.9 million tonnes in
the mid-1970s.
Meanwhile, output was multiplied by 2.3 across the period as a whole, with an average annual
increase of 5.2% between 1960 and 1974, +1.3% between 1974 and 1990 and -0.4% between
1990 and 2013, the latter figure reflecting the scale of the recession of 2008-2009.
Between 1990 and 2013, greenhouse gas emissions from industry fell substantially (-22.7 Mt). All
of the effects studied contributed to the fall in emissions over the period, with the exception of the
climate effect. The technical effect accounts for around half of this reduction. Over the period 1990-
2013 as a whole, the technical effect (i.e. the difference between the total variation in emissions
and the combined impact of other effects such as output, climate, structure and energy mix) made
a positive contribution to the reduction of emissions, equivalent to a total of 11.6MtCO eq or 0.5Mt
2
per annum. This improvement is the result of greater energy efficiency and the development of
new anti-pollution technologies. During the 1990s, fuel prices dropped (in constant currency). They
then increased sharply in the 2000s, providing further impetus to energy efficiency. Since 2006, the
energy efficiency certificate scheme has helped to increase energy efficiency in the industrial
137sector.
The output effect was virtually nil across the whole period (-0.5 MtCO eq.), but this quasi-stability
2
masks conflicting dynamics in the two sub-periods (+6.6MtCO eq between 1990 and 2002, and
2
-7Mt between 2002 and 2013).
With regard to combustible fuels, the evolution of the energy mix has favoured natural gas over oil
products, while biomass has also seen its market share virtually double in recent decades (from
5% to nearly 10%). Emissions therefore fell by a third as a result of changes in the energy mix.
• Electricity production
The evolution of greenhouse gas emissions linked to electricity production saw three distinct
phases in the years 1960-2013. Between 1960 and 1979, emissions increased sharply by 79
MtCO eq, driven by the increase in electricity production (+92 MtCO eq), as the effect of changes
2 2
in the energy mix was virtually nil. Between 1980 and 1988, emissions fell (-79 MtCO eq) due to
2
major changes in the energy mix (-101Mt) as the nuclear programme hit its stride, despite a big
increase induced by the output effect (+39 MtCO eq). CO2). Between 1989 and 2013 emissions
2
stabilised, with the effect of increasing output (+15 MtCO eq) offset by changes in the mix of
2
energy sources.

HAPTER ETHODOLOGICAL APPENDIX
i. Economic impacts: a detailed report on the analysis of the 
ThreeME model
Context
The ADEME and CGDD were asked to use ThreeME52 (Multi-sector Macroeconomic Model for the
Evaluation of Environmental and Energy policy) to simulate the macroeconomic effects of the roll-
out of energy transition scenarios generated by the DGEC following the application of the Law on
energy transition and green growth.
ThreeME is a multi-sector Neo-Keynesian macroeconomic model first co-developed by ADEME
and the OFCE (French Observatory for Economic Contexts) in 2008.
The result of the simulation will be presented after a brief description of the key characteristics of
macroeconomic modelling.  
The ThreeME model
The model developed jointly with the OFCE is a Neo-Keynesian “Aggregate Demand-Aggregate
Supply” model which is similar to those commonly used by economic forecasting organisations,
such as EMOD by the OFCE53 or MESANGE by INSEE,54 with the difference that it is multi-sector.
A Neo-Keynesian multi-sector model
ThreeME is broken down into 24 production sectors and 17 energy sub-sectors and allows us to
highlight the effects of activity transfer from one sector to another:
 on employment, because production sectors are not all equally labour intensive;
 on energy consumption, because they are not all equally energy intensive;
 on net exports, because they do not all have the same propensity for import and export.
For example, an increase in renewable energy in preference to combustion thermal power stations
leads to an increase in employment – the former being more labour intensive than the latter – and
a drop in fossil fuel imports.
Changes in job intensity in the economy has a direct influence on consumption and ultimately on
GDP, as do changes in external deficit, since this aggregate is equal to the sum of consumption C,
investment I, stock variation ∆S and net exports (X-M).
GDP = C+I+∆S+(X-M)
Given that demand has an influence on production (see infra), it is vital to carefully model the effect
of sectoral transfers on employment and net export, without which the model-maker runs the risk of
major forecasting bias.
Possible energy trade-offs

13917 energy sub-sectors have been identified (see the list of sectors on page 7) to model the energy
decisions of actors.
Enterprises making energy trade-offs:
• Substitute energy with capital when its relative price increases.
• May substitute energy sources with other energy sources.
Households choose between investments allowing them to make energy savings or not, notably
between three types of housing and vehicle.
• The market share of each type varies depending on the evolution of costs of use
(amortisation of the purchase price, net subsidies and energy consumption).
• The penetration rate of electric vehicles is assumed to be exogenous.
ThreeME also takes into account the effect of restraint incurred by variation in prices: households
reduce their heating and fuel consumption when prices increase and vice versa.
ThreeME also has the specific characteristic of being a hybrid model, in that it combines
macroeconomic and technical modelling of energy consumption. Actors’ investments (flow) lead to
changes in vehicle and housing stock (stock), and the structure of these stocks determines energy
consumption. This is an important difference against most general equilibrium models, in which
energy consumption is directly dependent on household income. Such models tend to generate a
forecasting bias because the relationship between energy consumption and income is not usually
linear.
Contrary to supply-only models (of Neoclassical design) Neokeynesian models like ThreeME take
into account the retroactive effect of variations in demand (consumption, investment and net
export) on supply (the sum of value added) and vice versa. A multi-sector Neokeynesian model can
therefore show the impact of energy transition on demand with less forecasting bias, and in turn
evaluate its effect on economic activity.
Crowding out due to money creation
One of the big differences between models of supply and demand (Neokeynesian, in dynamic
equilibrium) and models of supply (Walrasian, in static equilibrium) concerns the crowding out
effect between investments.
In ThreeME, investments are financed by through bank loans, which is a form of money creation,
and not only savings. The model presupposes a limited crowding out effect between investments.
For example, an increase in households’ investments in energy renovation does not lead to an
equivalent decrease in their expenditure. This decreases by an amount equal to the increase in
debt annuities as a result of the works minus the reduction in energy bills.
In Neokeynesian models such as ThreeME, increase in investment can offset the “deadweight
loss” entailed by instituting a tax. In supply-only models, an increase in taxes leads to an automatic
increase in the price of goods or factors subjected to them. It incites actors to make certain
investments in the place of others. These do not lead to an overall increase in demand because
the crowding out effect is a complete one. These investments are less profitable that those they
replace, because a tax is required to make them profitable. The tax therefore reduces profit and
investment, which negatively affects demand and growth, unless the tax leads to a reduction in
import either because it mainly concerns imported products such as fossil fuels, or because the
recycling of revenue enables the State to reduce another tax which is even more distortive, such
as employer contributions. In these cases, however, the cost of the tax is partially borne by
everybody else.
In the ThreeME model, energy efficiency investments resulting from corporate or household
140environmental taxes are mainly financed on credit, and do not fully substitute others. Capital-
energy substitution leads to an overall increase in investments in general because the crowding
out effect is only partial. Demand increases and companies’ outlets grow: demand influences
supply.
This leads to an increase in production (influenced by the increase in the amount of productive
capital and the increase in sales by capital goods suppliers) and a reduction in energy imports,
generating an increase in employment and therefore consumption; supply influences demand.
A spiral effect is sparked off in the short term but, in the long term, reimbursing the debt incurred by
financing the investment has a recessive effect on the economy (the money supply contracts).
In this theoretical context, in the short term, the introduction of an energy tax is offset by the
improvement in net exports and an overall increase in investment.
In the long term, if the sum of the direct revenue generated by the investment, the indirect revenue
resulting from the multiplying effect on employment, and changes in net exports cover the cost of
the debt, there will be a durable rise in GDP. On the other hand, if the investments are not
profitable (the NPVs are negative) and their losses are not made up for by the positive knock-on
effect they have on the rest of the economy, there will be a durable drop in GDP.
For example, the introduction of a carbon tax encourages consumers to favour less carbon-heavy
modes of transport, like for example shifting from road transport to rail. The use of cars decreases,
but public transport consumption increases. On the other hand, railways have a higher job content
than roads, leading to a reduction in unemployment which also positively and retroactively
influences demand. In a supply model, this effect would have been at least partially offset by a
downward trend in the level of profit, which would have reduced the amount of savings and
therefore investments, so that demand would have remained stable. In the case of a supply–
demand model in which savings do not finance investment, the creation of employment linked to
the transfer of activity from very energy-consuming sectors towards less energy-consuming sectors
has a positive multiplying effect on the economy, at least in the short term.
In theory, at full-employment equilibrium, Neokeynesian models also have Neoclassical properties.
The growth trajectory becomes perfectly stable. The growth rate of the GDP returns to the level it
was at before State intervention, but the level of GDP can differ in the long term from the level it
would have been at in the trend-based scenario.
It can therefore be shown that the introduction of an energy transition policy generates a dual
ecological and energy dividend.
The case of energy transition
Energy transition implies making energy efficiency investments and modifying the energy mix.
We have just explained why, in ThreeME, energy efficiency investments do not necessarily
substitute investments in other sectors. This argument is not valid for investments linked to
changes to the mix. For given demand at a moment T, the increase in the installed capacity of
renewable energy will be at least partially offset by a reduction in the installed capacity of non-
renewable energy. The increase in investments in green sectors should occur alongside a
reduction in investment in other sectors, notably carbon-heavy energy (this argument is also valid
for the different modes of transport). A significant substitution effect therefore exists independently
of financing method for these installations. The rise in investment in renewable energies should not
have a big knock-on effect in the short and medium term, unless the propensity to import capital
goods in renewable energy production sectors is lower than the propensity to import capital goods
in non-renewable energy production sectors, something which is not the case today.
On the other hand, replacing non-renewable energies with renewable energies will increase the
employment content of the sector and lead to a noticeable decrease in import figures for fossil
141fuels. This should have an expansionary effect.
However, the increase in energy prices which may occur as a result of this could, at least in the
short and medium term, have a recessive effect on activity, mainly through a decrease in domestic
and international competitiveness because companies will have to reflect this increase in their
sales prices. This could at least in part offset the expansionary effect linked to changes in
employment and importation of fossil fuels.
This said, on a macroeconomic level the costs of some are the gains of others. All revenue linked
to renewable energy production will be redistributed among actors (and ultimately to households)
through expenditure in the sector (salaries, intermediate consumption, investment, dividends), with
the exception of revenue that will be used to pay for imported goods and part of the debt burden
(used for bank repayments to the Central Bank). The rise in renewable energy production and
energy prices should therefore not negatively affect the average household disposable income net
of their energy bill, unless the propensity to import and the cost of capital in green sectors are
greater than in non-renewable energy sectors.
If the expansionary effects outweigh the recessive effects, and if the cumulative sum of increases
in GDP covers payment of the loan annuities, then the level of GDP will, in the long term, remain
greater than what it would have been if no transition had taken place. On the other hand, if the
recessive effects outweigh the expansionary effects, companies will have to raise prices and the
State will have to increase taxes in order to repay their respective debts. This will have a lasting
negative effect on demand.
Ultimately, the macroeconomic effects of the energy transition will depend:
 on the impact of the decrease in energy demand on net export
 on the reduction in energy production;
 on the influence of energy prices on energy efficiency investments and their profitability;
 on changes in the different sectors’ propensity for import/export;
 on the impact of the increase in companies’ production unit costs on prices and domestic
and international demand;
 on the modalities of redistribution of environmental tax revenue;
 on changes in employment.
Calibration of the model
In order to correctly differentiate between the recessive and expansive effects at play, is vital to
carefully calibrate the model.
The ThreeME model has been calibrated using several data bases, firstly on national account
tables (input-output and the overall economic picture) by the INSEE for the base year (2006)55, as
well as on sectoral bases for housing (CEREN), vehicles (Car labelling by ADEME) and energy
consumption for the different sectors (CEREN). Fluctuations in the economic context observed
between 2006 and 2015 have been reproduced through the introduction of tax and budgetary
reforms and imbalances in net export observed for the period.
Close attention has been paid to production unit costs, since these greatly influence the results.
The energy production unit costs have been calibrated using the report on electricity production
cost by the DGEMP (2003).56 The other costs have been calibrated using the In Numeri report
55http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/comptes-nationaux/default.asp?page=archives/archives_cnat_annu.htm
56DGEMP, DIDEME, “Coûts de référence de la production électrique”, Report, December 2003. 79 p.
142(2008).57 The cost of nuclear energy estimated by the DGEMP in 2003 has been corrected using
the report on the cost of nuclear energy (2012)58 by the Court of Auditors and Senate report written
on the subject (2012).59 The cost per MWh (excluding cost of conveyance) is set at €50/MWh for
existing stations (including extension costs). The EPR production cost has been set at €70/MWh
based on the report. This figure corresponds to the lower range of the estimation, going from €70
to €90/MWh.
It has been supposed that renewable energy industries’ propensity to import capital goods will
converge towards that of industrial branches between now and 2030-2040. This implicitly means
that the State will encourage the growth of sectors in the country through its policy for invitation to
tender. 
Average production prices in 2006, Source ThreeME 2014 according to the CGDD
The parameters of the behavioural equations are estimated on the basis of econometric studies by
the CEREN and INSEE for actors’ energy trade-offs. For households’ energy consumption,
ThreeME distinguishes short-term price elasticity (effect of restraint or limitation due to the increase
in energy prices) and decisions between inefficient investments (such as purchasing a vehicle high
in energy consumption, renovation work without insulation) and efficient investments (purchasing
an economical vehicle, efficient renovation work). The decision is made by the household with
consideration for the cost of use of the vehicle and housing, which depends on the cost of
investment, cost of credit and anticipated energy prices. For energy substitutions, elasticities from
publications have been used for housing (of the order of 0.8), whereas the penetration rate of
electric vehicles is exogenous because it is not possible to aptly model actors’ choices due to a
lack of data over a longer period.
In industry, energy and inter-energy capital elasticities of substitution have been set at 0.5 and 0.4
respectively for fuels used for heat production.

143Outside of the energy sector, behavioural equations have been configured based on econometric
studies by the OFCE including wage setting (Wage Setting WS Curve), price setting (markup rule)
and elasticity of substitution between production factors (CES function). In this exercise, it is
assumed that real interest rates remain fixed. The dynamic properties of the model are
consequently comparable to those of the economic forecast used by INSEE and the Directorate
General of the Treasury in Bercy, MESANGE. If public investment increases by 1 GDP point,
economic activity will increase in the short term by 1.3%.
Results of the macroeconomic modelling
To understand the macroeconomic effects of energy transition, we will compare the economic
aggregates of a trend-based scenario called AME (“With Existing Measures”) with those of the
reference scenario for energy transition called AMS2 (“With Additional Measures”).
Calibration of the business-as-usual scenario (AME) and the reference scenario used to
establish the sectoral distribution of transition (AMS2 in the rest of this section)
The calibration of the model was modified in accordance with hypotheses on changes in:
- demographic growth
- increase in productivity
- price of fossil fuels
- new registration numbers and the penetration rate of electric vehicles
- construction of new housing
- the share of the different means of energy production in each carrier (fuel, electricity, heat
and steam), which has been exogenously set in accordance with hypotheses of the
scenario
- environmental tax measures (CIDD and EcoPtz)
- price of the CO  quotas in the European market
2
144To model the effects of the AMS2 scenario, the following modifications have been made to the
AME trend-based scenario:
1. The share of the different energy production modes in each carrier (fuel, electricity, heat and
steam) has been exogenously set in accordance with the hypotheses of the scenario.
2. Regulations measures and additional investments have been introduced according to different
modelling techniques:
a. Simulation of the measure as such:
• Increase in the number of zero interest loans released;
• Changes in the CITE (energy transition tax credit) level;
• Investments in railways and public transport;
• Rise in the penetration of electric vehicles (EV);
• Improvement in the performance of personal vehicles, light commercial vehicles and
heavy goods vehicles;
• Change in vehicle occupancy rates;
• Modal shift among travellers between road and rail;
• and the rise of soft mobility;
• Road traffic speed reduction;
• Increasing the number of new constructions;
• Improving the energy performance of domestic hot water production and cooking;
b. “Fictional” increase of energy prices in behavioural equations for economic actors,
allowing the desired target of consumption to be reached (see details below):
• Requirement for renovation in the tertiary sector and strengthening of the EEC;
• Improvement of thermal standards in the construction industry;
• Rise of energy efficiency investment in industry.
3. Increase of carbon tax
Carbon tax will increase from €22 in 2016 to €56/tCO  in 2020 and €100/tCO  in 2030 (at constant
2 2
Euro exchange rate for 2015). It will remain at €100/tCO  after that (constant 2015 euros).
2
Concerning energy demand, signal prices have been introduced to encourage actors to reach end
consumption targets in the scenarios. They reflect the implicit cost of strengthening standards and
improving yield. The advantage of this method is that the investment mechanisms are
endogenous. Only investments linked to new housing and new vehicle registration are exogenous.
145This is why the sum of investments does not correspond exactly to the estimation, all other things
being equal, for the macroeconomic analysis of scenarios by the Seureco-Enerdata-Energies
Demain-CITEPA consortium.
For that matter, 45% of renovation investments in housing are financed by loan, compared to 33%
in NEMESIS. The other types of investments are financed exclusively by loan (also including
purchase of a new-build, whereas according to NEMESIS, households borrow 85% of the sum
when purchasing new housing).
Modelling the measures listed above allows end consumption targets given in AMS2 for each
sector to be reached (115 Mtoe vs 112).
The version of the model used is the one with little delay in adjustment in the quantity of production
factors used (estimations by macro-econometric models usually consider that the quantity of
production factors used - capital, labour and intermediate consumption – is adjusted to its “desired
level” with a delay).
146Expansionist effects
Energy transition has a positive knock-on effect on economic activity.
Figure 6.1 : Difference of GDP between the reference scenario (AMS2) and a business as usual scenario.
Source ThreeME 2015 ADEME/SEP
Applying AMS2 produces an increase in GDP by 1.6 points in 2035 compared to its level in AME.
Most of the growth is driven by investments at the start of the period, which lead to the creation of
new jobs and an increase in consumption, which retroactively and positively influences activity.
The difference then gradually disappears as actors pay off their debts and as a result of a
reduction in the net export deficit. The decrease in energy consumption is offset by the drop in
exports caused by the rise in inflationary pressure, and the increase in import linked to a rise in
consumption. Nevertheless, the trade deficit to GDP ratio decreases, but the external deficit to
GDP ratio decreases by 0.8 points in 2035.
Over time, the difference in GDP remains positive, since in 2050 the difference between the level
of GDP in AMS2 and GDP in AME remains close to 1 point.
This policy leads to a decrease in the public deficit to GDP ratio from 2020 as a result of (see table
below):
o a decrease in State social spending (drop in unemployment),
o additional tax income (due to an increase in activity),
o and a rise in GDP.
147Figure 6.2 : contribution of the main agregates to the differences of GDP between the reference scenario
(AMS2) and a business as usual scenario (AME). Source ThreeME 2015 ADEME/SEP
Household consumption increases as a result of energy savings and job creation, generated both
by a high level of activity in the civil engineering sector between 2017 and 2021 and the energy
148transition. It initially increases at a moderate rate due to the increase in household loan
repayments. The latter is attributable to an increase in energy renovation works and a near
doubling of new constructions. There is a crowding out effect. It later increases at a sharper rate
then stabilises at 1.5 GDP points.
Figure 6.3 : difference of employment between the reference scenario (AMS2) and a business as usual
scenario (AME). Source ThreeME 2015 ADEME/SEP
The implementation of measures planned in the AMS2 scenario would allow the creation of
390,000 additional jobs in 2035 compared with AME and 350,000 jobs on average between 2015
and 2035. The percentage of the working population in employment out of the overall population
would increase by 1.5% in 2035. The percentage of the working population in unemployment
would decrease by 1.3% in 2035.
149Conclusion
According to our simulations, the measures represented in AMS2 would lead to a rise in
investment and the creation of jobs in green industries, which outweighs the loss of employment in
fossil fuel energy and high-energy-consumption sectors, as well as a decrease in the net export
deficit to GDP ratio. In the short and medium term and in spite of the rise in prices, the measures
lead to an increase in demand which positively and retroactively influences supply, so that the level
of GDP is greater than what it would have been without the additional measures. All things
considered, the energy transition leads to a profit equal to the revenue that would be generated by
an additional year of growth during the period in question, i.e. 1.6 GDP points in 2035 compared
with its level in AME. The percentage of working population in employment would increase by
1.5%.
Over time, the cumulated sum of energy savings and additional revenue generated (notably
through expansion of the wage bill) would cover most of the debt and costs of interest linked to
financing the transition. We also see value creation because the rise in GDP continues long after
2035 and rises again to 1 GDP point in 2050.
This modelling work supports the point of view that the energy transition will not inevitably be costly
as a result of the rise in energy prices in the short and medium term. In addition, it would not
necessarily be detrimental to household purchasing power and industrial activity, although
compensation measures targeting the most vulnerable sectors of the population could be
envisaged.
Reduction of the ecological footprint and greenhouse gases does not imply a decrease in
economic activity. It seems possible to separate GDP and CO  emissions.

150ii. Method of analysis of the social impacts in terms of 
equitable redistribution
Generally speaking, the method used for this analysis was based on external data produced during
the elaboration of the SNBC. This data was input into adapted tools by the ERNR3 (Prométhéus
microsimulation model, National Transport and Travel Survey), allowing it notably to be broken
down according to different socio-economic characteristics. This allows us to analyse the impact of
the SNBC in terms of renovation investments made in occupied housing and according to
standards of living, or in terms of savings in heating or fuel bills, also according to standards of
living.
1. Renovation investments and energy consumption in housing
1.1 Analysis of renovation investments per decile of standard of living
1.1.1 Transition matrix for each housing type
The analysis of renovation investments borne by households was based on one hand on the
dynamics of flow of renovation for each housing type, and on the other hand on the distribution of
households among housing types.
The external data produced during the elaboration of the SNBC60 provided the dynamics of the
existing housing stock in the business-as-usual scenario (or the trend-based scenario, called AME)
and in the energy transition reference scenario (called AMS2), for each housing type (detached
house, multi-unit housing, social housing) and energy class (from “0”, for housing that has
undergone no renovation since 2010, to “+++”, in cases where the housing has undergone thermal
renovation affecting all areas of consumption reduction: facade, roof, openings).
As a reminder, the typical works envisaged behind these actions are the following:

enter class “+”. Source: Énergie Demain, CGDD calculations.
1.1.2. Determining the costs associated with renovation works
The external data produced during the elaboration of the SNBC has provided the sums invested
during each period and for each scenario.

Total 2015-2028 336.6 219.7
Source: Énergie Demain.
The external data produced from the elaboration of the SNBC has also provided the costs
associated with renovation works for each dwelling and type of work undertaken, with a distinction
between detached houses and multi-unit housing.

These prices are likely to change over time and are not dependant on the surface area of the
dwelling, though it may seem logical to think that the bigger the dwelling to be renovated, the
greater the renovation investment. Given the lack of additional information on changes in the
renovation cost per dwelling over time, and to what extent these changes are affected by the
152surface area of the dwelling, the following hypotheses have been adopted:
- for each period, we have a created a homothetic increase in renovation costs per work, so
that the total amounts invested coincide with the amounts in the external data. This
hypothesis allows us to maintain the hierarchy of costs according to the work and the
differential cost between types of housing. For each period, we can therefore obtain the
average renovation cost per dwelling according to the work and housing type. We check
that the profile of the changes in costs obtained is not too irregular over time (cf. figure 6.4);
- we also assumed that the renovation costs were proportional to the surface area of
dwellings. Alternative hypotheses consist in considering that a given part of these costs
does not change, but due to the lack of information on the subject, the hypothesis of pure
linearity was preferred. For each period, we therefore obtain the renovation costs per m²
according to the work and housing type. We see that the costs thus obtained within the
same type of renovation work for all types of housing have a relatively stable profile over
time (although they could be higher for detached houses), and that the hierarchy between
the different works is generally respected (cf. figure 6.5).
It is worth noting that in the reference scenario, average renovation costs are lower in the 2019-
2023 period than in the 2015-2018 or 2024-2028 periods. In this scenario, the share of inexpensive
renovation works is greater in 2019-2023 (from 0 to + or from + to ++) than during the other
periods. In the business-as-usual scenario, works are more costly during the 2019-2023 period
(although essentially fewer in number).

housing type Source: CGDD calculations

housing type Source: CGDD calculations.
1551.1.3. Break-down of renovation investments in dwellings according to the
standard of living of the occupant household
Average investments in relation to the surface area are broken down per decile of standard of
living, based on the distribution of households within each housing type. This distribution was
provided by the Prométhéus model by the CGDD, which simulates households’ energy
consumptions in their dwellings on a microeconomic level for the year 2006 (for example, see table
below for detached houses built after 1975).

Using the surface area of the dwelling produced by Prométhéus for 2006 (cf. below), we can
deduce the investments per decile, according to the renovation work and housing type. The
surface area of the dwelling is assumed to remain constant over time.

We can also determine the distribution of households between the different types of housing and
energy classes, which follows the development of renovation flows from one class to another (for
example, see below). Within each energy class, it is assumed that the distribution per decile
follows the one given by Prométhéus for 2006.

By aggregating renovation investments per housing type, energy class and decile, we can obtain
the investments made in housing in the existing stock distributed per decile of standard of living in
the business-as-usual scenario and the reference scenario.

1571.2. Analysis of energy consumption per decile of standard of living
The external data produced during the elaboration of the SNBC has provided the unit energy
consumption (per unit of surface area) for heating according to the date of construction of the
dwelling and for the year 2010.

The Prométhéus model allows us to separate these external figures to obtain an estimation of unit
consumption for heating according to the housing type considered in this analysis (see below).

Note: Énergie Demain, Prométhéus (version produced from the French national housing survey in 2006),

The renovation works also lead to savings in unit consumption for heating, depending on the
housing type and scope of the works63. Assuming that the existing housing stock in 2010 is entirely
composed of housing in class “064“, the unit consumptions above correspond to housing in this
class. From this, we can deduce the unit consumption for heating in each housing type according
to the energy class (for example, see below). It is assumed that these unit consumptions remain
unchanged so long as the housing remains in the same energy class. They are the same in both
the business-as-usual and the reference scenarios.

+++ 74% 45
Source: Energie Demain, CGDD calculations.
63   These savings, produced by works carried out in the framework of the SNBC, depend on the energy class the housing belongs to as
well as the housing type, and are analysed in reference to class “0” for this housing type. For detached houses built after 1975, for
example, unit energy consumption savings are at 9% for class “+” in relation to class “0”, 39% for class “++” and 74% for class “+++”
(source: Energie Demain).
64   In the simulations by Énergie Demain, renovation works carried out before 2010 and allowing class “+” or higher to be reached are in
the minority. Therefore, the hypothesis made in the framework of our analysis is almost confirmed.
158The next step is to break down unit consumption for heating into the different heating types for
each housing type and energy class. This break-down depends on both the distribution of housing
with regards types of heating and the unit consumption associated with each one. To simplify
things, we have assumed that the unit consumption for each type of heating only depends on the
type of housing. In other words, for example, the unit consumption for heating in detached houses
built after 1975 and in class “0” is 155 kWh/m², regardless of the type of heating. In reality,
however, this is not the case, since for example the unit consumption of housing with electric
heating is much lower than that of housing with gas heating. If these inequalities reflect differences
in energy efficiency between housing with electric heating and housing with gas heating (linked to
geographic or socio-economic factors), it would not seem relevant to keep them unchanged
throughout the reference scenario. On the other hand, if these inequalities reflect intangible factors
(for example, gas heating in regions with a harsher climate), they should be taken into account.
Given the uncertainty and lack of structuring and explanatory factors, it would seem better to keep
to the simplified hypothesis given above.
Consequently, the break-down of unit consumption for heating into the different heating types
depends only on the distribution of housing with regards types of heating. This distribution has
been provided by the external data produced during the elaboration of the SNBC:
Distribution of housing (primary residence) with regards types of heating

From this, we have deduced the unit consumption for heating per housing type and energy class,
broken down according to types of heating (see below, for example).

For 2006, Prométhéus also provides the distribution of unit consumption per housing type (see
below) as well as the floor area of housing, as seen above. From this, we can deduce the energy
consumption for heating per housing type, energy class, energy type and decile of standard of
living for both the reference and business-as-usual scenarios.

Lastly, the external data produced by the elaboration of the SNBC have provided the energy prices

The figures for energy prices in both scenarios allows us to determine the energy consumption for
heating for each housing type, energy class, type of energy and decile of standard of living.
Considering the distribution of households across the different housing types and energy classes,
we have deduced the heating bill for each decile of standard of living.

1.3. Implicit hypotheses in the analysis of housing renovation costs and energy
consumption
It should be noted that the above analysis has been conducted based on the following hypotheses:
 by investments per decile, it should be understood investments made to renovate housing
lived in by households in this decile, regardless of who bears the cost, whether it is the
household itself or, if the case may be, the owner of the dwelling. In reality, it can be
expected that renovation works are most often carried out by owner-occupiers, who
consequently belong to higher deciles of standard of living. It should not be excluded that in
the case of renovation work carried out on housing lived in by tenants, the cost of the
investment may be subsequently passed on through the rent paid by the tenant;
 the probabilities of renovation, the costs associated with the different works and the
associated energy savings are assumed to be independent of the deciles of standard of
living;
 the distribution of housing per heating type is assumed to be independent of the deciles, and
identical whatever the housing type (type and energy class, excluding class “0” for which the
distribution remains unchanged in comparison to the initial date);
 consequently, inter-decile variation concerns the distribution of households among types of
housing (less well-off households are more often in multi-unit and social housing), the
distribution of unit consumption among deciles (inverse U-shaped curve, with less well-off
households having higher unit consumption than medium-level households, which in turn
160have a lower consumption than that of well-off households), and finally the floor area of
housing (with less well-off households having less floor area). These different distributions
are assumed to remain stable over time. These hypotheses are based on the assumption
that households do not move during the period of study and that the structure of households
living in the existing stock is constant;
 for all households, the unit consumption of each housing type is considered constant,
whatever the heating type;
 new housing built during the 2010-2028 period have not been included in the analysis, and
the amounts calculated (housing renovation and energy consumption costs) concern
households in the existing housing stock.
2. Analysis of the energy consumption of fuel
The external data produced during the elaboration of the SNBC has allowed us to identify the
evolution of the number of vehicles in the vehicle stock per fuel type, the fuel efficiency and
average distances travelled each year (for example, see below).
Characteristics of petrol-engine vehicles in the reference scenario, for 2019-2023

Fuel efficiency (in L/100km) 6.4
Distance travelled each year (in km) 9,276
Note: Énergie demain, CGDD calculations.
The National Transport and Travel Survey (ENTD) also provided the distribution of the vehicle
stock per decile of standard of living for 2007-2008, as well as fuel efficiency and distances
travelled (see below for example).

Note: according to the National Transport and Travel Survey in 2007-2008, households in the first decile
possess 6% of petrol-engine vehicles, which consume 7.2 L/100km and travel 7293 km per year.
We can use these distributions to determine, in each scenario, the distribution of households per
type of vehicle, their energy efficiency and the distances travelled. By taking into account fuel
prices, we can deduce the fuel consumption for each type of vehicle, broken down per decile, since
the aggregation of consumption gives the average fuel consumption for each decile.

Note: in the reference scenario and for 2020-2023, fuel consumption is at €865 per year for households in
the first decile.
It should be noted that the analysis of households’ fuel consumption has been conducted based on
the following hypotheses:
 the relative distribution of households per type of vehicle, the fuel efficiency and distances
travelled are assumed to remain unchanged over time;
 concerning electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles, the ENTD does not provide sufficient data.
For electric vehicles, we assumed there was an even distribution of households, energy
efficiency and distances travelled; for the fossil fuel share of hybrid vehicles, we assumed
the distribution was identical to that of petrol-engine vehicles;
 The analysis does not take into account the costs associated with replacing the vehicle
stock.
162iii. Analysis of changes in national greenhouse gas emissions 
from 1960 to 2013
A study commissioned by the Ministry for Ecology in 2015 and conducted by the CITEPA/CEREN
provides an analysis of changes in national greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2013 for all
sectors, and an extended analysis for 1960-1990 for sectors connected to energy. This study
allowed us to:
1. identify the main parameters influencing developments in greenhouse gas emissions
observed in France;
2. better comprehend the relationship between the evolution in these parameters and
variations in emissions.
Emissions were analysed in Metropolitan France.
Different methods have been used, including analysis of raw data on changes in potential
explanatory factors in changes in greenhouse gas emissions, principal component analysis or
other analysis methods such as cointegration and decomposition of effects, when possible in terms
of data available and convincing results.
A sectoral approach has also been adopted. Changes in greenhouse gas emissions were analysed
for each sector in the inventory, and in some cases the analysis was broken down into sub-sectors.

Waste management
1. Evolution in greenhouse gas emissions per sector in Metropolitan France
Between 1990 and 2013, total greenhouse gas emissions (excluding changes to land usage and
forestry) fell by 12.3%. This overall reduction in emissions is the result of an 11.7% increase in
emissions in the transport sector, a 5.9% increase in emissions in the residential-tertiary sector, an
11.1% increase in emissions in the waste management sector, and a 39.8% reduction in emissions
in the manufacturing sector a 30.9% reduction in emissions in the industrial energy sector, and a
6.1% reduction in emissions in the farming/forestry sector.
These sectoral changes need to be weighted to take into account the contribution of each sector to
overall greenhouse gas emissions. Fluctuations bucking the general trend were observed during
this period, particularly under the impact of certain government policies.
Descriptions of policies and measures implemented since 1960 are available in the national
communications submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention (UNFCCC) every 4 years,
which   can   be   downloaded   at   the   following   address:
http://unfccc.int/national_reports/annex_i_natcom/submitted_natcom/items/7742.php.
1632. The transport sector
Since 1990, emissions from this sector have increased by 11.1% (from 118.3 MtCO2eq in 1990) to
reach 131.4 MtCO eq in 2013. Within the sector, road transport made the biggest contribution
2
(92% of greenhouse gas emissions), followed by air travel (3% of greenhouse gas emissions) and
maritime transport (1% of greenhouse gas emissions).
2.1 Changes in the road sector between 1990 and 2013
In 2013, Private Vehicles (PV) were the cause of 56% of greenhouse gas emissions, Heavy Goods
Vehicles (HGV) 23% and Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV), 20%.
The three vehicle categories were analysed separately. Cointegration models were tested to find
the relationship between certain factors and changes in greenhouse gas emissions.
We define a:
• “Certain” effect of a parameter as its direct or indirect physical contribution to the increase
or decrease in emissions.
• “Probable” effect of a parameter as its direct or indirect physical contribution to the increase
or decrease in emissions, while considering it weak and/or offset by a significant rebound
effect.
• “Ambiguous” effect of a parameter as a contribution that varies according to the analyses
conducted in this study (positive, negative or neutral), or that could not be defined in this
study.

2.2 Changes in the road sector between 1960 and 2013
The method used to break down effects for the period of 1960 to 2013 allowed the following
principal parameters to be identified:
• Traffic effect: between 1960 and 1990, greenhouse gas emissions were systematically
pushed upwards by the volume of traffic per inhabitant, except in economic crisis years
such as 1974 or 2008.
• Miles-to-the-gallon effect: conversely, the reduction in average unitary consumption of road
vehicle stock (miles-to-the-gallon) which has improved over the years, thanks in particular
to the application of European or national policies (bonus-malus schemes, European
regulations limiting CO2 emissions for new vehicles), has helped limit greenhouse gas
emissions.
• Share of fossil fuels (% fossil sources) effect: gradual introduction of biofuels contributed to
165decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from 2005.
• Population effect: constant growth of the population between 1960 and 1990 contributed to
increasing greenhouse gas emissions, but to a lesser extent than traffic.
• Greenhouse gas emissions per fossil fuel energy consumption effect: the emissions factor
(GHGEmi/FConso) led to a slight increase in emissions.
• Non-Integrated effects: these effects are very limited and thus validate the method.
Figure 6.6 : decomposition of the contributions to the interannual variations of evolution of the road transport
sub-sector
o Changes in the aviation sector between 1990 and 2013
Greenhouse gas emissions from the aviation sub-sector have been on the rise since 1990, peaking
at 4.7 MtCO2eq in 2000. They then gradually declined until 2010, stabilising at just under 4
MtCO2eq.
The principal parameters affecting emissions are: passenger.kilometres (PKT: the product of the
number of passengers transported and kilometres travelled); average capacity (number of
passengers divided by the number of journeys containing passengers only, excludes cargo flights);
cargo; number of passengers for all speeds; GDP per inhabitant.
Two periods have been distinguished for the aviation sector from the principal component analysis:
- The first period (1990-2000) was characterised by a rise in tourist and commercial
passenger numbers, leading to an increase in emissions. This period was favourable from
an economic point of view.
- The second period (2001-2013) was characterised by a decrease in traffic as passengers
turned to alternative means of transport, in a context rendered less favourable by
increasing Brent fuel prices, leading to a decrease in emissions.
These evolutions should be considered in parallel with two events separating these periods:
11 September 2001: terrorist attack in the USA leading to a change in behaviour among users.
In France: the opening of the high-speed train line (LGV Méditerranée), leading to a transfer from
166air to rail transport among passengers.
4. The agricultural sector
4.1. Field crops
Emissions from arable crops fell slightly between 1990 and 1994. This was followed by a period in
which emissions increased until 2000, when the downward trend was restored, despite a few
sporadic instances which went against the general trend. Overall, between 1990 and 2013,
emissions from the sector dropped by 8.4%.
The principal parameters analysed owing to their impact on emissions for the sector were: nitrogen
spread (mineral, organic and pasture); farmland; the price of Brent fuel; the price of natural gas;
the price index of straight fertilisers (IPAMPA); support provided (direct support from the first pillar
of the CAP); GDP from Agriculture.
Emissions connected to crop farming have been mainly affected by use of nitrogen on farmland
and the economic circumstances affecting the sector. Certain public policies may also contribute to
the fall in emissions, such as the nitrates directive or subsidies from the second pillar of the CAP.
From 2000, the increases in fertilizer prices may also have contributed to reducing emissions.
The decline in the amount of agricultural land and a tricky economic context can partly explain the
downturn in farm emissions in this period, even as crop production continued to increase.
4.2. Livestock
Emissions from livestock followed a slight downward trend in 1990-1998 before rising in 1999. This
was followed by a downward period until 2004, when emissions stabilised. In 1990-2013 livestock
emissions decreased by 6.5%.
Two main areas have been considered in the analysis of these emissions: enteric fermentation and
management of animal excretion.
General parameters have also been taken into consideration: methanisation; the price index of
animal feed (IPAMPA); subsidies provided (direct support from the first pillar of the CAP and the
dairy premium); GDP from Agriculture. Additional parameters were taken into account for beef
cattle herds; milk yield; excretion management methods (manure or slurry).
Figure 6.7 : decomposition of the components contributing to te variation of emissions from animal
husbandry
Beef cattle herds have the strongest influence on livestock emissions. During the period in
question, the total number of cattle in France decreased while the dairy yields increased. These
developments should be seen in the context of the restructuring of the dairy sector (milk quotas
introduced in 1984), the dairy premium and CAP reform. As for the management of cattle effluent,
167we have moved from a system dominated by manure use to a more even balance of manure and
slurry, reflecting the structural evolution of cattle farms and the gradual disappearance of small
herds. Although slurry systems generate more emissions, overall emissions from animal waste
have remained relatively stable as changing uses have been balanced out by the general decline
in cattle numbers.
Meanwhile, the development of methanisation techniques has contributed to a reduction in
emissions from the sector.
Lastly, the economic state of the sector, represented by GDP from Agriculture in our analysis,
showed a drop in activity over the period which was accompanied by a decrease in emissions.
Likewise, the changing prices of production inputs also had an impact on emissions from the
sector. This is borne out by the IPAMPA of animal feed (index for the average purchase price of
agricultural inputs) which has increased over the period in question. This change may indirectly
explain certain reductions observed in emissions.
4. The waste management sector
Emissions linked to waste management increased by nearly 10% in 1990-2013 (16.8MtCO eq in
2
1990, 18.4MtCO eq in 2013) to represent 4% of total greenhouse gas emissions in 2013. The
2
breakdown of effects method was used for this sector.
Figure 6.8 : decomposition of the contributions to the interannual variations in the emissions of the west
sector
It gave the following results:
 “Quantity of waste produced per inhabitant” effect: this parameter first had an upward
influence on greenhouse gas emissions (from 1991 to 2000), followed by a downward trend
(from 2001 to 2013) as a result of a decrease in the production of waste for the number of
inhabitants.
 “Inhabitants” effect: the increase in the number of inhabitants led to a slight increase in
waste.
 “Greenhouse gas emissions for the quantity of waste produced” effect: this factor tended to
increase greenhouse gas emissions until 1995. The effect then followed an overall
downward trend during the following period. This may result from higher collection rates at
the end of the 1990s.
1685. The residential – tertiary sector
Between 1960 and 2013, direct greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption in the
residential and tertiary buildings increased by 77%, going from 49 million tonnes to 86.6 million
tonnes. The evolution of these emissions has involved several distinct phases. Demographic
developments, economic activity, changes in heating habits, energy prices, environmental issues
and the government policies which take them into account, thermal regulations and household
reactions, as well as the evolution of the energy mix which emits more or less greenhouse gases,
have all had an impact on the overall level of emissions.
With the exception of demographic factors, which have had a steady impact on the level of
greenhouse gas emissions, all of the other factors listed above have influenced fluctuations in
emissions to varying extents at difference periods.
The sub-period 1960-1975 saw strong economic growth (an average of 5.2% per annum) and low
energy prices.
The sub-period 1975-1990 was marked by the effects of the first oil crises in 1973, at a time when
economic growth was strong but not as strong as it had been in the preceding period (average
annual growth of 2.7% between 1975 and 1990).
The sub-period 1990-2002 saw prices fall in real terms, as growth remained strong (average 2%
p.a.)
The sub-period 2002-2013 saw a sharp increase in energy prices, and a slowdown in economic
growth (average 1.1% p.a, with recession in 2008-2009). This sub-period also saw the gradual
introduction of new thermal regulations for housing, with notable reforms in 2000 and 2005.
5.1. Analysis of direct emissions linked to the consumption of fuel in 
residential and tertiary buildings
Between 1960 and 1990, direct greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption in residential
and tertiary buildings increased by 37.6 million tonnes, which is an increase of 77% in relative
value.
Emissions   in   the   tertiary  sector
multiplied by 3.7 during this period,
and those in the residential sector
increased   by   42%.   The   overall
evolution   for   both   is   therefore
similar throughout the period, with
a peak in both sectors in the mid-
1970s, followed by a decrease until
the early 1990s and a period of
relative stability between 1990 and
2013.

sector (after correction for climate anomalies) 
5.2. Factors explaining the changes in greenhouse gas emissions from 1960 
to 2013 in the residential sector
169a. The residential sector, 1960-2013 (in MtCO2eq.)
We used the breakdown of effects method. The results are presented in the graph below in
MtCO eq.
2
Figure 6.10 : decomposition of the factors of variation of the GHG emissions induced by energy consumption
in the building sector between 1960 and 2013
Greenhouse gas emissions increased by 18.5 Mt during the period. The Energy Mix effect,
concentrated in the first sub-period (-19.7 Mt) mostly offset the significant Stock effect (+21 Mt).
It is worth noting that the “energy efficiency” effect is far from being dominant in each sub-period. It
was mainly negative between 1960 and 1975 (+38.3 Mt), due in particular to the large-scale
penetration of central heating in residences, with 53% of households fitted with it in 1975 compared
to just 20% in 1962. This phenomenon continued between 1975 and 1990 with another rise in
central heating fitting by nearly 30 points in the period (82% in 1992 compared to 53% in 1975).
However, it later had a strong positive impact on greenhouse gas emissions after the first oil crisis
(-22.7 Mt between 1975 and 1990) and in connection with the rise in the nuclear power programme
linked to the spread of electric heating.
b. The residential sector, 1990-2013:
The analysis of the 1990-2013 period of the above graph was carried out using limited and partial
data available for the 1960-1990 period and extended to the 1990-2013 period. These results were
refined by carrying out an analysis specific to the latter period, using the CEREN statistics IT
system, which notably allowed analysis of the impact of the spread of electric heating and
insulation works in homes.
Greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy consumption were virtually stable (“total
variation”). The “Stock” and “Energy efficiency” effects (“efficiency_balance”) were dominant and
cancelled one another out (1.1% increase in greenhouse gas emissions per year on average for
the first, and a 1.5% decrease per year for the second).
170Figure 6.11 : decomposition of the factors of variation of the GHG emissions associated with energy
consumption in the building sector between 1990 and 2013
The effects in MtCO eq are described in greater detail.
2
• Stock effect: this led to an average increase of 1.1% in emissions per year between 1990 and
2013.
• Climate effect: throughout the 1990-2013 period, the climate effect reduced overall greenhouse
emissions (-0.5% per year on average). The earlier years were milder than at the end of the
period (only two years were colder than the “normal” year). This led to a corresponding
decrease of 2.8% in greenhouse gas emissions per year between 1990 and 2002. From 2002
to 2013, the climate effect led to an increase of 1.5% in emissions per year. Four years were
colder, including 2010 which was a particularly cold year, explaining a negative impact by the
climate on emissions in this period. Unlike in the tertiary sector, the overall climate effect in
1990-2013 helped reduce emissions.
• Structure effect (residence type: house/unit): this effect is negligible here, residence types not
having significantly changed between 1990 and 2013.
• Fuel mix effect: regarding fuel, changes in the energy mix show a trend in favour of natural gas
to the detriment of domestic fuel. This change helped decrease greenhouse gas emissions, but
the relative drop in wood burning contributed to increasing emissions. All things considered the
share of reduction of emissions linked to the change in the energy mix was estimated at -0.2%
on average per year between 1990 and 2013. There results differ according to the period in
question: the drop in wood burning between 1990 and 2002 more than attenuated the savings
generated by the penetration of gas. The effect of the energy mix therefore increased
emissions by 0.4% per year on average over the period. The relative savings from gas and
wood burning in the energy mix later led to a significant decrease in the level of emissions (-
0.9% per year on average between 2002 and 2013).
• Electric heating effect: the impact of this effect on greenhouse gas emissions was estimated at
-0.5% per year on average between 1990 and 2013. The electric heating effect reflects the
substitution of fuel heating with electric heating, leading to a decrease in emissions thanks to
the combined effect of a decline in unitary consumption and reduced average greenhouse gas
content. This effect was greater in the second period due to an acceleration in the penetration
of electric heating (34% of market share in 2013 compared to 28% in 2002 and 26% in 1990).
This acceleration was notably boosted by the spread of heat pumps in households from the
171mid-2000s.
• Energy efficiency effect (“energy_balance” in the graph): this effect, calculated as the difference
between the total variation in emissions and the overall impact of all the above effects in the
1990-2013 period, contributed to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, its effect being
estimated at -1.5% per year on average. However, it had a varying impact according to the
sub-period in question: -0.5% per year between 1990 and 2002, then -2.5% per year between
2002 and 2013. It is worth noting that fuel prices were relatively stable in constant currency
during the first period, whereas they rose significantly during the second period. The
combination of the economic context and the successive waves of thermal regulations
encouraged energy efficiency actions during the second period. Overall in 1990-2013, the
Building insulation effect accounted for approximately half of energy efficiency savings to
varying extents according to the sub-period, equating to the overall savings in the 1990-2002
period, and approximately half of overall efficiency savings in the 2002-2013 period.
c. The tertiary sector, 1960-2013 (effects in MtCO2eq):
Figure 6.12 : decomposition of the factor of variation of GHG emissions induced by energy consumption in
the tertiary sector between 1960 and 2013
Greenhouse gas emissions associated to energy consumption in the tertiary sector increased by
21.1 Mt between 1960 and 1990. The stock effect (+16.9 Mt) and low energy efficiency (+12.4 Mt)
had the greatest impact by far. This is partially offset by the other effects which contribute to
decreasing emissions, particularly the energy mix (-5.0 Mt). It is worth noting the impact of poor
energy efficiency between 1960 and 1975 (+18.2 Mt) and, conversely, the positive impact from
energy efficiency actions during the second sub-period (-5.8 Mt between 1975 and 1990).
d. The tertiary sector, 1990-2013:
The analysis presented in the figure 6.12 for the 1960-2013 period was carried out using limited
and partial data available for the 1960-1990 period and extended to the 1990-2013 period. The
results for the 1990-2013 period have been refined by performing a new, specific analysis using
the CEREN statistics IT system, which has notably allowed analysis of the impact of the spread of
electric heating.
Greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption were relatively stable (“total variation” bar).
172The stock and energy efficiency (“efficiency-balance”65) effects heavily impacted changes in
emissions. It is worth noting the heightened energy efficiency effect between 2002 and 2013 (-
2.2% per year on average) compared with the previous period (-0.1% per year in average between
1990 and 2002).
Figure 6.13 : decomposition of the factor of variation of GHG emissions induced by energy consumption in
the tertiary sector between 1990 and 2013
 Stock effect: this was the dominant force, leading to an average increase in emissions by
1.4% per year between 1990 and 2013. Growth slowed slightly in the second period, going
from an average of 1.7% per year between 1990 and 2002 to 1.4% per year between 2002
and 2013.
 Climate effect: the reference degree-days and observed degree-days which allow us to
analyse the climate effect in the tertiary sector are calculated per tertiary branch while
taking into account sectoral specificities. In the 1990-2013 period, the climate effect
contributed to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, with the yearly average at +0.3%
with variations within the period (-0.5% per year between 1990 and 2002, then +1.2% per
year between 2002 and 2012). During the first period, the weather was fairly mild. There
were only two years which were colder than “normal”. During the second period, there were
four years which were colder than “normal”, including 2010 which was particularly cold.
 Structure effect (building type): this has been a very marginal effect (0.04% increase in
greenhouse gas emissions per year linked to this effect), with the rise in heated surfaces
remaining relatively stable in each of the eight tertiary branches evaluated (catering,
community living, health, education, sport/leisure/culture, offices, businesses, transport).
 Fuel mix effect: regarding fuel, changes in the energy mix show a trend in favour of natural
gas to the detriment of domestic fuel. This change fostered a decrease in greenhouse gas
emissions of -0.3% per year on average in 1990-2013. This downward impact was slightly
less pronounced in the first period (1990-2002) due to a slowing of work to substitute fuel
with gas in the mid-1990s.
65 The “efficiency-balance” effect in the residential sector is the difference between the total variation in emissions calculated by the
CEREN and the sum of stock, climate, electric heating, energy mix and insulation effects.
The difference method is linked to the methodological differences in calculating emissions between the CITEPA and the CEREN.
173 Electric heating effect: the impact of this effect was estimated at -0.4% on average per year
between 1990 and 2013. It reflects the replacement of fuel heating with electric heating,
leading to a decrease in emissions due to the combined effect of a decline in unitary
consumption and lower average greenhouse gas content.
 Energy efficiency effect66  (“efficiency-balance” on the graph): this effect reflects the
variation in energy consumption in the tertiary sector in relation to the heated area and
excluding the effects already mentioned. This balance includes “behaviour/investments”
effects by users/managers influenced by changing energy prices or government policies.
For the 1990-2013 period, the technical effect, which is the difference between the overall
change in emissions and the total impact of all the above effects, contributed to reducing
emissions and was estimated at 1.1% on average per year. This can be assimilated to
energy efficiency improvements. The level varied over time, going from -0.1% per year
between 1990 and 2002 to -2.2% per year between 2002 and 2013. It is worth noting that
fuel prices dropped in constant currency in the first period, whereas they rose significantly
in the second period, a factor which doubtlessly spurred on energy efficiency actions.
Thermal regulations also affected the tertiary sector from the 2000s, improving overall
energy efficiency through new buildings and thermal renovation.
5.3. Factors explaining the evolution of direct and indirect greenhouse gas 
emissions from the residential-tertiary sector
The above analysis concerned direct emissions linked to fuel consumption in residential and
tertiary buildings.
Analysing indirect emissions allows us to take into account the specific effects of electricity
consumption, and more particularly the impact of average greenhouse gas content per kWh of
electricity, the impact of air conditioning and the impact of other specific uses.
Total emissions from energy consumption in the residential and tertiary sectors (direct and indirect)
are presented below for 1990-2013, as the 1960-1990 period has not been the subject of a
sectoral breakdown for indirect emissions due to a lack of studies allowing us to do so.
66This effect is calculated as the difference between the total variation in emissions and the sum or stock, weather, electric heating,
energy mix and structure effects. The effect of the “scope-method difference” incorporates the methodological differences linked to the
different approaches by CITEPA and CEREN and the differences in scope of surveys linked to the tertiary sector.
174Residential buildings (effects in MtCO eq.)
2
The “average greenhouse gas
content per kWh of electricity”
effect led to a significant drop in
emissions:
-10.7 MtCO eq between 1990
2
and 2013.
This reduction was concentrated
in the first sub-period.
-9,0 Mt between 1990 and 2002
due to milder climate conditions.
The effects of specific electricity
consumption were limited, as a
result of the low greenhouse gas
content of this consumption.

emissions induced by energy consumption in the residential
sector (including indirect emissions associated with the

The   evolution   in   average
greenhouse   gas   content   per
kWh of electricity helped drive
down emissions by 5.7 MtCO2eq
between 1990 and 2013.
The spread of air conditioning
had   a   limited   impact   on
emissions   due   to   its   low
greenhouse gas content.
The same is true of the effect of
specific uses, which was almost
nil between 2002 and 2013, as a
result   of   improved   energy
efficiency in lighting and office
equipment.

emissions induced by energy consumption in the tertiary
sector (including indirect emissions assoiated with the
production of electricity between 1990 and 2013
6. The industrial sector
Between 1960 and 2013, direct greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption in the
industry were virtually halved, shrinking from 105.2 million tonnes to 62.7 million tonnes, after
peaking at 137.9 million tonnes in the mid-1970s.
Meanwhile, output was multiplied by 2.3 throughout the period, with an average annual increase of
5.2% between 1960 and 1974, +1.3% between 1974 and 1990 and -0.4% between 1990 and
2013, the latter figure reflecting the scale of the recession of 2008 and 2009.
175Figure 6.16 : decomposition of the factor of variation of GHG emissions induced by energy consumption in
the industry (in Mt CO2 eq.) between 1960 and 2013 and evolution of the industrial production over the
same period (indexed as 100 in 1960)
The graph below breaks down changes in direct greenhouse gas emissions in MtCO eq induced
2
by energy consumption into four effects (production, energy mix, structure and technical-
substitution) and evolution of the industrial production between 1960 and 2013.
Figure 6.17 : decomposition of the contribution of different factors to the variations of the GHG emissions
associated with the consumption of energy in the industry sector between 1960 and  2013 (in Mt CO2 eq.) 
Direct greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption in industry decreased by 42.5 Mt
between 1960 and 2013. A number of effects contributed to this drop in emissions, with the
“technical-substitution” effect being the main one by far (-63.9 Mt). The energy mix effect pulled
down greenhouse gas emissions by 18.6 Mt, mostly between 1960 and 1990, in particular thanks
to large-scale move away from carbon between 1960 and 1975. Conversely, the increase in
industrial output drove up greenhouse gas emissions, with the effect concentrated in 1960-1990.
Overall in 1960-2013, the output effect led to an increase in emissions of 45 Mt.
• The 1990-2013 period
176The results presented in the above graph for the 1960-2013 period have been produced using
limited and partial data available for the 1960-1990 period and extended to 1990-2013. The results
have been refined by carrying out a new analysis specific to this period using the CEREN statistics
IT system, which notably allowed us to replace the analysis in 15 branches in 1960-2013 with an
analysis in 250 industrial products.
This analysis shows that greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption in industry have
noticeably decreased (-22.7 Mt). All the effects had a downward influence on emissions throughout
the period, with the exception of the climate effect. The technical-substitution effect accounts for
approximately half of the decrease in emissions, while the effect of energy mix accounts for
approximately one third.
Figure 6.18 : decomposition of the contribution of different factors to the variations of the GHG emissions
from energy consumption in the industry sector between 1990 and  2013 (in Mt CO2 eq.)
 Output effect: the overall output effect was virtually nil throughout the period (-0.5 Mt),
although this near-stability is the result of two contrasting sub-periods (+6.6 Mt between
1990 and 2002 and -7 Mt between 2002 and 2013).
 Structure effect: this helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions (-4.8 Mt) in the first sub-
period.
 Fuel mix effect: regarding fuel, changes in the energy mix show a trend away from oil
products and towards natural gas and biomass, the latter seeing its market share nearly
double over the period (from 5% to nearly 10%). Emissions went down as a result of
changes in the energy mix.
 Technical-substitution effect:  throughout  the 1990-2013 period,  the  technical  effect,
calculated as the difference between the total variation in emissions and the overall impact
of all the above effects, had a positive impact in reducing emissions, estimated at nearly
11.6 MtCO2eq, i.e. 0.5 Mt on average per year. These savings can be assimilated with
energy efficiency improvements and environmental remediation schemes. During the 1990s
fuel prices dropped in constant currency, whereas they rose sharply during the 2000s, a
177factor that tended to encourage energy efficiency actions. The energy savings certificates
scheme launched in 2006 also contributed to energy efficiency in industry.
7. Electricity production from 1960 to 2013
The explanatory variables used included the amount of electricity produced and evolutions in the
production stock (distribution between sectors (heat, nuclear, renewable energy) and energy
efficiency).
The graph below summarises the results.
Determining factors in the annual evolution of emissions from electricity production in MtCO2eq
(between 1960 and 2013)
Figure 6.19 : decomposition of the contribution of different factors to the inter-annual variations of the GHG
emissions for the production of electricity between 1960 and  2013 (in Mt CO2 eq.) 
The evolution of greenhouse gas emissions linked to electricity production between 1960 and 2013
saw three clearly distinct phases:
• From 1960 to 1979: emissions increased sharply by 79 Mt, driven by the increase in
electricity production (92 Mt), as the effect of changes in the energy mix were virtually nil.
• From 1980 to 1988: drop in emissions (- 79 Mt) due to a significant effect from the mix and
changes in production stock (- 101 Mt), as the nuclear programme hits its stride, despite a
big increase induced by the output effect (+ 37 Mt).
• From 1989 to 2013: emissions stabilised, with the production effect (+ 15 Mt) being offset
by the effect of changes in the production stock.

Introduction
This appendix constitutes a clearly identifiable part of the SNBC and responds to the obligation of
France under Article 10 of Decision no. 529/2013/EU of the European Parliament and Council of
23 May 2013 on accounting rules on greenhouse gas emissions and sequestration resulting from
activities relating to land use, land-use change and forestry and on information relating to those
activities
It describes the current context in France in the LULUCF sector (Part 1), presents data from the
National Greenhouse Gas Inventory submitted to the United Nations Framework on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) under the terms of the Kyoto protocol (Part 2), presents the results of
projections (Part 3), and lastly presents information on levers for reducing emissions (Part 4) and
current and prospective policies and measures in the framework of the SNBC (Part 5).
The Low-Carbon Strategy is designed to describe the main aims, but it does not replace sectoral
plans. The reference scenario (AMS2 run 2 later on in this appendix) may therefore be revised
according to targets adopted in the framework of the National Biomass Strategy.
1791. The situation in France
The surface area of Metropolitan France (550,000 km²) is the largest of all the countries in the
European Union (approximately 13% of the area covered by the European Union). Situated
between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea between latitudes 41°N and 51°N, France
has around 3,200km of coastline. The country’s altitude is average, with plains and mountains
covering two thirds of the territory, and it has two mountain ranges on its east and south borders:
the Alps and the Pyrenees. The highest point in France is the summit of Mont Blanc, at 4,810m,
which is in the Alps and on the border with Italy. The Massif Central, in the centre of the country,
distributes water to the four main basins via the Seine in the north, the Loire in the north-west, the
Rhône in the east and the Garonne in the south-west.
Farmland (cultivated and permanent grassland) occupies 51% of the surface area of Metropolitan
France. Zones considered natural areas (woodland, moor, open land, wetland and areas covered
by water) account for 40% and artificialised land for 9% (built-up areas, covered or stabilised land,
other artificialised land).
1. 1 Agriculture
The farming and agrifood industry generated approximately 3.2% of national GDP (1.6% and 1.6%
respectively) in 2011 and accounted for 5.6% of total employment in 2011 (3.3% and 2.3%
respectively). France is the leading agricultural producer in Europe and is in second position in
terms of revenue from agrifood industries on a European level.67
In 2010, farming activity covered 29.2 million hectares out of the 55 million that make up
Metropolitan France. 131,800 hectares out of the 8.5 million hectares in Overseas Departments
are agricultural land. There are approximately 515,000 farms across the territory.
Utilised agricultural area (UAA) has shrunk steadily since 1950. This reduction has benefited
wooded areas and non-agricultural land which have increased by 75,000 and 51,000 hectares
respectively on average per year since 1950. For example, between 1990 and 2010 UAA
decreased by 75,000 hectares on average per annum (Cf. Table 1, below).
The breakdown of the territory between arable land (63%), permanent grassland (33%) and
permanent crops (4%) has remained relatively consistent, but it is important to note that areas of
permanent grassland have nevertheless followed a downward trend, accounting for 37.3% of UAA
in 1990 compared with just 33.3% in 2010.

180Like its European neighbours, French farming saw unprecedented modernisation and rises in
productivity over the course of 50 years. The farming sector must now meet new challenges
concerning the protection of the environment and natural resources and the fight against climate
change. France’s agro-ecological project and the rolling out of the Common Agricultural Policy
contribute to promoting more sustainable farming that reconciles economic and ecological
efficiency.
1. 2 Forestry
France has the second largest forested area out of the 28 countries in the European Union
(Sweden has 28 million hectares (Mha) and Finland has 23Mha), representing 10% of the EU’s
forests.68 Forests cover nearly 24.3 Mha, with 16 Mha in Metropolitan France, i.e. 27% of the
metropolitan territory, and 8.3 million hectares in Overseas Departments (Guadeloupe, French
Guiana, Martinique and Reunion, Mayotte). French Guiana is a mainly wooded department with
forest covering 95% of the territory and contains almost all the forested area in the overseas
departments.
Broad-leafed woodland covers 62% of the forested area in Metropolitan France, resinous trees
cover 21% and the remaining 17% is composed of mixed woodland. The forestry sector employs
approximately 400,000 people directly and indirectly, most often in rural areas.
The surface area of French forests has grown sharply since the late 19th century. It is estimated
that wooded area in France covered between 8.9 and 9.5 million hectares in 1830, and
approximately 10 Mha in 1900 before reaching 16 Mha in 2014.69 Wooded area (forests and other
woodland, the latter currently covering about 2 Mha) has increased by approximately 7 million
hectares since 1900, rising by around 68,000 hectares per year between 1980 and 2000. This
expansion mainly took place through the natural colonisation of land not used for farming.
Private forest in Metropolitan France accounts for 75% and is very broken up. The remaining 25%
is composed of national forest owned by the State (10%), and forest belonging to regional
government (15%). In the Overseas Departments, forests are mainly national forests.
The standing timber volume of French forests is growing at a fast rate, with a gross annual
increase of approximately 120 Mm3. (total above-ground wood volume) in 2004-2012, whereas
average annual felling is estimated at around 60 Mm³ in total above-ground volume, which is a fell
rate of approximately 50%.70. This felling includes commercial and own-consumption harvesting
including from forests, losses and smallwood.1
The French forest carbon sink is one of the largest in the European Union.
According to an approach based on the report written by France for the UNFCCC, in 201371
there was: 
• a forest carbon sink of around 65.5 MtCO eq (of which 58 MtCO eq for forests remaining
2 2
so, and 7.5 MtCO eq for land being turned into forest)
2
• a carbon sink of around 11 MtCO eq for pastureland
2
• a carbon sink of around 2 MtCO eq for wetland
2
• a source of around 21 MtCO eq for cultivated land,
2
• a source of around 12.5 MtCO eq for urbanised areas

70IGN 2014
71CITEPA v2015 inventory for 2013
181Altogether, for all land uses (forestry or not), this corresponds to a LULUCF balance for the
sector of a carbon sink of approximately 45 MtCO eq (not including carbon stored in wood
2
products).
In the accounting format for the Kyoto protocol, in 2013 for forest land alone, the carbon sink
(again excluding carbon stored in wood products) was in the order of 52 MtCO eq72 and was
2
composed of a sink of nearly 54 MtCO eq by way of forestry management, a sink of 10 MtCO eq
2 2
relating to wooded areas since 1990 and a source of 12 MtCO eq corresponding to already-
2
cleared woodland. The carbon sink in harvested wood products was estimated at 3.8 MtCO eq in
2
2013.
These figures can be viewed against the reference level set for France for its “Forestry
Management” activity, in the framework of the 2nd period of the Kyoto Protocol (2013-2020),
since carbon footprint of Forestry Management is indeed compared with this projected reference
level. The difference between the emissions recorded for this activity in the inventories each year
and the reference emissions gives the overall balance of emissions (or carbon sink, if the
emissions are negative) recorded for the activity. The projected reference level is estimated by
modelling the trend of carbon emissions and sequestration from “Forestry Management”, taking
into account the impact of the policies in effect until mid-2009.
The projected reference level for France in 2011 was 63 MtCO eq on average per year for
2
2013-2020 (67.4 MtCO eq including harvested wood products), but this was calculated based on
2
past French data which has since been significantly revised (following a technical correction
by our national forestry inventory in 2011, leading to a significant decrease in the estimations of the
forest carbon sink). In order to take these new results into account, a technical correction of the
reference level is currently in process.

Comments:
- Due to a change of method, only 2013 shows a representative result for the balance of
emissions connected to the evolution of the wood products category. Emissions only linked
to the degradation of wood products are presented for 2008-2012, and not the sink
corresponding to the production of new products, where the “instantaneous oxidation”
accounting rule has been used for this period.
- “Pasture management” and “Crop management” are not included for this period.

3. Projections of emissions and absorption for the accounting period 2013-
2020 and until 2035.
This section presents the results of perspective scenarios for 2035 created in the framework of the
elaboration of the present national low-carbon strategy.
The AME scenario “with existing measures” is based on all measures effectively introduced or
executed before 1 January 2014, and assumes a slight increase in felling in forests. The AMS2
scenario “with additional measures 2” (corresponding to the reference scenario described in
chapter 2 of the SNBC) includes all the measures allowing us to meet the objectives of the law on
energy transition and green growth (LTECV). It assumes a greater increase in wood harvested
from forests.
In both scenarios, the level of felling in forests only constitutes a provisional hypothesis, which will
be revised later. Felling targets will be established in the National Strategy for the Mobilisation of
Biomass provided for in the Law on Energy Transition and Green Growth. New projections will be
able to be made for the LULUCF sector based on these objectives – in the knowledge that they will
not affect the carbon budgets set for sectors that are sources of emissions, but excluding LULUCF.
Whatever the case, reaching national targets for the development of renewable energy will imply a
186substantial increase in felling in woods, if we consider that net imports of biomass cannot be
excessively increased. An ambitious revival of the use of wood as a material (timber, and in
construction in particular), of which firewood is mainly a coproduct, may be necessary.
Concerning DOM, COM and PTOM,76 the trends have been extended to produce the projections
presented.

1914. Analysis of the potential for emissions limitation or reduction, and 
maintaining and reinforcing absorption and adequate measures.
4.I. Agricultural land
The existing scientific literature highlights numerous techniques for boosting carbon capture in soils
and biomass:
• optimising grassland management to encourage carbon capture (maintaining permanent
grassland and improving the productivity of the least productive land)
• slowing down the artificialisation of land
• developing agro-forestry systems (tree planting in forest parcels, hedgerows and tree cover
on the boundaries of agricultural plots);
• promoting agro-ecological production systems based on: soil coverage (catch crops;
intercropping and grass patches), simplified tilling, longer rotation periods.
• continuing efforts to promote the value of grass and grazing
• developing the production of materials and energy from bio-based resources, replacing
energies and materials which generate substantial amounts of greenhouse gases.
Scheduling implementation of the AMS2 measures, with an enhanced agro-ecology programme
founded upon a number of action priorities for 2035:
• protecting permanent grassland;
◦ Guideline target: restricting the reduction in permanent grassland to 490,000 ha
between 2010 and 2035
• developing agro-forestry, hedgerows and other agro-ecological infrastructure;
◦ Guideline targets: 700,000 ha of hedgerows and 120,000 ha of closely-managed agro-
forestry by 2035
• soil coverage and increasing the proportion of organic matter in our soils;
◦ Guideline target: Catch crops (CIPAN nitrate traps) accounting for 80% of spring crops
by 2035
• slowing down the artificialisation of land;
The cumulative effects of a territorially-coherent effort to implement these actions and halt the
artificialisation of land (as per the model used to create the AMS2 scenario) will allow us to invert
the trend for CO2 emissions from agricultural land, slashing these emissions from 9.9 to 3.6
MtCO2 between 2013 and 2035 (UNFCCC measurements)
Last but not least, the production of extra biomass will create substitution effects for materials and
energy.

The French wood and forestry sector can make a major contribution to reducing GHG emissions,
capturing carbon and respecting our international commitments, with a number of key priorities:
1921) using wood instead of energy-intensive materials such as aluminium, steel, cement and
petrochemical plastics;
2) using forestry biomass and the by-products of the timber industry for energy purposes, as well
as wood products reaching the end of their life cycle, replacing fossil fuels;
3) carbon storage in wood and wood-based products;
4) carbon capture by the forestry ecosystem thanks to photosynthesis (soils, forest litter, biomass
above and below ground).
It is important to adopt the broadest possible approach to the mitigation potential offered by this
sector, including all GHG sources over the long term.
The CGAAER report of October 2014 on the contribution of agriculture and forestry to the fight
against climate change insists upon the importance of these 4 action priorities, and particularly the
2 substitution measures.
The effects of carbon capture also need to be taken into account - in biomass, above ground and
below ground, as well as the substantial quantities captured in the soil. We must also remain
attuned to the potential risks of carbon release. France's forests currently act as a major "carbon
sink," especially since the volume of standing timber is growing rapidly (wood felling corresponds
to just half of annual biological growth less natural mortality, and the existing forestry stock is
relatively young on account of planting campaigns by the National Forestry Fund (FFN). Forests
also continue to expand and occupy former farmland).
But for a truly long-term approach, substitution effects (energy and materials) also need to be
further developed. The corresponding reduction in emissions will be crucial in the medium and long
term, facilitating the transition to a low-carbon (and bio-based) economy. The volume of carbon
stored in biomass and the soil cannot continue to grow indefinitely (indeed it is already stabilising in
a number of EU nations); furthermore, increasing these carbon stocks also increases the risk of
subsequent release, particularly as climate change may have a significant destabilising effect on
ecosystems (insect attacks, trees blown down by storms, forest fires etc.). It is therefore crucial
that we boost the potential for substitution effects.
Moreover, in order to reduce the risk of carbon release from forestry ecosystems, we need to find a
more dynamic way of managing forests which are currently under-managed or not managed at all.
This is particularly important for medium-density coppice, land left wild after being abandoned by
farmers, forestry areas in decline and other areas which are too densely planted. Where the
potential of the ecosystem allows it, converting coppice to forest-standard coppice or even full
timber forest will allow us to increase the proportion of quality timber produced, as well as
increasing overall forest productivity and thus boosting the rate of GHG retention. The same goes
for former agricultural land, which can be replanted with higher-yield species which are better
equipped to resist climate change.
Substitution effects should be prioritised, primarily those offered by expanding the use of wood as
a building material
i) this approach will allow us to make optimal use of wood resources - in terms of value
added, jobs created and greenhouse gas emissions avoided (substitution effects from
material uses are more significant than those made possible by energy uses);
ii) sales of quality timber will be the primary economic driver behind the development of
forestry management;
iii) developing timber operations will require an increase in tree selection and thinning
activities, separating the best quality timber from lower-quality wood which can be used in
193other areas of the wood industry (panel boards, paste, wood fibre etc.)  and for energy
purposes; low-quality wood (branchwood) can also be harvested along with stems from
timber-quality trees;
iv) timber processing will generate by-products which can be used for material or energy
purposes; at the end of their life cycle, after reuse and/or recycling, wood products can also
be used for energy generation (this is the "cascade" system of wood use, with a clear
hierarchical chain).
The development of timber will thus act as a catalyst for the whole forestry-wood sector.
1945. Policies and measures (in place and forthcoming) and their impact
5.1. Agricultural land
5.1.1. Policies and measures in place and scheduled for launch
The implementation of the agro-ecological plan and its sub-strategies will incorporate numerous
actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote carbon capture in agricultural soils.
The 2014-2020 CAP reform paved the way for more effective consideration of climate change and
greenhouse gas emissions, with both the 'greening' of the first pillar and the reinforcement of the
second pillar. The regionalisation of the second pillar has also opened up more room for
manoeuvre at territorial level, allowing us to tailor our actions to local requirements.
 a) National application of the CAP
• The conditional aspects of the CAP and the implementation of good agricultural and
environmental conditions (GAEC) apply to all of the direct support available to rural
development:
◦ GAEC I buffer strips
◦ GAEC IV minimum soil cover
◦ GAEC VI ban on burning arable stubbles
◦ GAEC VII retention of landscape features (hedgerows etc.)
• Greening the CAP
◦ maintaining permanent grassland;
◦ diversification of crop rotation;
◦ protected ecological areas.
• Rural development:
◦ Agri-environmental and climate measures (AECMs)
▪ AECM Systems: AECM maintenance of extensive grasslands and grazing / limiting
intensification and returning organic material to the soil; AECM maintaining and
changing practices in mixed farming systems / limiting inputs; AECM changing
practices in large arable farming / improving the carbon capture capacity of soils. 
◦ Agro-forestry measures;
◦ A plan to boost competitiveness and help farms to adapt by investing in new equipment,
for example simplified crop cultivation techniques.
 b) National strategies implemented within the framework of the agro-ecological project
The national strategies described above are based primarily on the European funding provided
under the 1st and 2nd pillars of the CAP.
◦ The agro-ecological project (diversifying crop rotation, agro-forestry, soil tillage, reducing
mineral fertilisers etc.)
• The Organic Ambition programme, supporting organic agriculture (limiting direct impact of
LULUCF, reducing total emissions from the agricultural sector)
195• The plant protein plan, developing the cultivation of protein-rich plants (limiting direct impact
of LULUCF, reducing total emissions from the agricultural sector)
 c) Other regulations and legislation
• Measures to halt the artificialisation of land (ALUR and LAAF acts): protecting agricultural
land and their carbon capture potential
• Agroforestry development plan
5.1.2. Policies to be developed/reinforced
These recent policies focus on the period up to 2020, and we will need to go much further in order
to hit our targets for 2050 by pushing for stricter requirements (in negotiations on the future of the
CAP, in order to avoid distorting competition at the European level), investing more in innovation,
training and information, exploiting opportunities for synergy between public policies and
encouraging experimentation by all stakeholders (government, local authorities, professional
bodies, NGOs etc.).
We must promote technical innovation (in equipment and in terms of the precision of agricultural
practices) as well as institutional and organisational innovation, with new instruments born of
ground-level experiments and sharing of best practices.
Scientific research is expected to yield strategic breakthroughs, allowing us to develop economic
tools which will:
- recognise and promote the environmental and social contributions of agriculture
 - take the carbon content of agricultural produce into account (via life cycle analysis, in particular),
master the complex task of measuring emissions (in light of the numerous biological and cultural
phenomena involved),
produce suitable inventories and monitoring systems.
Special attention should be devoted to preserving and increasing the carbon content of our soils,
supporting the new initiative launched by the Minister for Agriculture ahead of the COP21
conference in December 2015: "4 for 1000: soils for food security and the climate." This initiative
involves two major actions: an international programme of scientific research and cooperation, and
a coalition of stakeholders committed to soil preservation.
A considerable amount of training and technical advice will be required to encourage the
identification, optimisation, deployment and spread of innovative agricultural techniques and
practices. Agricultural training must integrate these issues into its programmes from the outset, as
must farmers when planning for their future.
Finally, reorganising the chains upstream and downstream of farms could help with cost
abatement.
5.2 Forestry - Wood
The mitigation actions to be prioritised in the land and forestry sector, described in detail in Section
4 above, are as follows:
Action 1: using wood instead of energy-intensive materials such as aluminium, steel, cement and
petrochemical plastics;
Action 2: using forestry biomass and the by-products of the timber industry for energy purposes, as
196well as wood products reaching the end of their life cycle, replacing fossil fuels;
Action 3: carbon storage in the form of wood products;
Action 4: carbon capture by the forestry ecosystem thanks to photosynthesis (soils, forest litter,
biomass above and below ground).
5.2.1. Policies and measures in place and scheduled for launch
The majority of the policies and measures implemented or scheduled for the wood and forestry
sector will have combined effects on several of these actions.
• Amended budget (LFR) for 2013:
◦ the extension and renovation of the fiscal incentive for forestry investment (DEFI),
encouraging forestry owners to manage their resources sustainably, and to join forces in
producers'   organisations  in  order  to receive  more  tax  credits.  Improving forestry
management will yield multiple benefits, including reducing overcrowding in some forests,
making forests more resistant to storm winds and making better use of wood.
◦ the creation of the forestry investment and insurance account (CIFA), giving forestry owners
an incentive to take out insurance against storm damage, start saving to fund preventive
work and, where relevant, to clean up and replant damaged zones. The goal is to make
forests more resistant to climate change, and thus capable of capturing more carbon;
◦ the introduction of a new, higher rate of degressive amortization for production, sawing and
processing equipment acquired or constructed by companies in the wood sector between
13th November 2013 and 31st December 2016. The aim of this measure is to develop
transformation activities all over the country, encouraging wood as an alternative material
and energy source, including its by-products and waste products.
• Law on the Future of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (LAAAF), published 14th October
2014:
◦ recognition that CO  capture by forests and wood products is a matter of public interest;
2
◦ creation of the Strategic Fund for Wood and Forests (FSFB) to provide financial backing for
the forestry policy. This initiative covers all of the action priorities, in that the fund can be
used to support all manner of actions relating to forestry resources and their multifunctional
management;
◦ creating Forestry Economic and Environmental Interest Groups (GIEEF) to promote the
sustainable management of private forestry resources at the appropriate territorial level,
bringing forestry owners together to develop wood operations;
◦ the National Programme for Wood and Forestry (PNFB), broken down into regional forest
and wood programmes; These programmes set out the broad lines of national forestry
policy and its regional variations for the next 10 years; they cover all of the key mitigation
action priorities.
• The National Action Strategy for the Future of the Wood Industries (PNAA), paired with
the Strategic Contract for the Wood Sector (cf. infra) which aims to secure the future of
companies involved in the business of transforming wood. This strategy sets out four strategic
priorities:
◦ redynamising the sector,
◦ taking into account the need for more funding to develop competitiveness,
◦ immediate, structurally-significant actions,
◦ the rapid introduction of structural changes designed to make the sector more competitive,
197• The 'Wood Industries' strategy, one of the 34 plans included in the Nouvelle France
Industrielle programme launched by the President in September 2014 and  officially
integrated in May 2015 by Economy Minister E. MACRON into the "Sustainable Cities"
section of the FUTURE INDUSTRY strategy. This plan aims to promote the use of wood in
construction and for interior design purposes, including tall buildings;
• the new  Wood Construction Techniques Action Plan,  including measures to promote
professional training, the rehabilitation of existing buildings (thermal insulation and expansion)
and the use of hardwood timber in construction;
•
• the National Plan for Bio-Based Construction Materials, designed to support other forms of
construction with bio-based materials (excluding timber);
•
• the Heat Fund: expanded, with more resources allocated to promoting the use of wood
(€30M). In addition to this raft of tax credits aimed at the forestry sector, the heat fund offers
financial incentives for biomass burners. This should also serve to bolster demand for wood,
increase energy substitution effects and helping to galvanise the whole sector;
•
• The National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (PNACC): although focused on adaptation,
this plan includes measures with direct consequences for climate change mitigation, including
measures in line with Action 3: "Promoting the adaptive capacities of forestry resources and
preparing the wood industry for climate change" (measures 3.1, 3.2 & 3.3);
• The Strategic Contract for the Wood Sector (CSF Bois) signed 16 December 2014, which
builds upon the measures included in the National Action Strategy for the future of the wood
industries (PNAA) and aims to contribute to the industrial development of the wood sector.
These measures should allow us to promote the use of wood for construction, establishing
clear quality categories for French wood (particularly hardwood), removing regulatory obstacles
to the use of wood and developing promotional strategies focusing on architecture and interior
design.
• The National Biomass Strategy and Regional Biomass Plans will identify different potential
sources of useful biomass, the corresponding volumes and, where relevant, the measures to
be taken to ensure that these resources are used effectively. These plans will also include
objectives for the development of biomass for energy purposes.
5.2.2. Policies to be developed/reinforced
5.2.2.1. intensifying felling in forests:
• speeding up development of forestry infrastructure (paths and cables);
• improving cooperation with local authorities and, above all, private forestry owners;
• supporting the creation of GIEEF Forestry Interest Groups;
• ensuring that firms in the forestry sector are well-equipped;
• boosting the incentive offered by these fiscal measures in favour of sustainable
management, increase wood use and combined forestry management;
• supervising the sustainable development guarantee, ensuring that the applicable rules are
respected.
5.2.2.2. increasing the productive capacity of forests and their role as "carbon pumps":
198• improving forestry quality and promoting timber-quality wood, introducing more productive
species and/or species better adapted to climate change and the local conditions,
• speeding up forestry renewal
5.2.2.3. speeding up the replacement of energy-intensive products with wood or wood-based
products:
• increasing consumer awareness of the advantages of low-carbon products;
• supporting the increased use of wood-cellulose fibres in construction (new criteria in public
contract documents, including these materials in the rules for calculating the energy
consumption and substitution effects of buildings etc.), furnishing, packaging etc.
5.2.2.4. promoting carbon storage in wood products, and encouraging their reuse:
• promoting eco-design and the development of a circular economy;
• stepping up efforts to collect, sort and recycle low-carbon products;
• making it easier to recycle wood products, providing a boost to the circular economy.
5.2.2.5. accelerating the substitution of wood for fossil fuels by:
• creating 'Energy-Positive Territories for Green Growth', striking a balance between
investment which consumes wood and the use of forestry resources, adapting the network
of biomass burners to the wood resources available locally, adopting sustainable
management practices;
• providing incentives for industrial operators to use high-efficiency wood burners to fuel their
heat networks;
• updating regulations so that wood or wood-based products can be used for heating
purposes when they reach the end of their life cycle
5.2.2.6. supporting and expanding intangible investment (studies, research).
• improving our understanding of the sector, its material flows, its economic consequences
etc.;
• improving our understanding of GHG flows: continuing the work started by the ADEME
"REACCTIF" scheme (BicaFF, GesFor, Evafora projects etc.);
• further research to understand the temporal dimension of GHG flows: major research
projects are already under way at EU level (the UK Forestry Commission is a close partner)
and in France (methodological work with the ADEME, review of the existing literature on
carbon debt etc.);
• launching new research intended to reduce the level of uncertainty in our models and
measurements.
• developing a forestry equivalent to the Clim'Agri local decision-making tool produced by the
ADEME (providing an estimate of GHG emissions and sequestration, based on a certain
number of variables). This will provide local authorities with a better idea of their GHG flows
in the Agricultural and Forestry sectors, helping them to target policy initiatives more
effectively.
• improving   our   understanding   of   the   connection   between   agricultural   and   forestry
management practices and the amount of carbon stored in the soil (cf. the '4 for 1000'
project for agricultural land).
5.2.3. Monitoring indicators to put in place
No new indicators have been created specifically for the SNBC, existing indicators will be used.
1995.2.3.1. With regard to the "carbon pump" effect:
• Biological growth minus mortality (annual measurement; IGN volumes of solid timber and
total volume, distinguishing between hardwood and resinous trees).
• Number of GIEEFs set up, and total surface area covered by these GIEEFs (annual
measurement)
5.2.3.2. Monitoring the efficiency, from a climate perspective, of the way wood resources are used:
• Wood   harvested   (felling   minus   operational   waste).  Annual   measurement   in   Mm3;
distinguishing between hardwood and resinous trees (Sources: EAB - annual branch
surveys - conducted by the MAAF for wood brought to market, IGN for total harvested
volume);
• Operational waste. Annual measurement, in Mm3 (Source: IGN)
• Volume of sawed lumber produced in France (annual measurement); distinguishing
between hardwood and resinous trees (Source: EAB)
• Volume of wood used for energy purposes (annual measure) (sources: EAB for wood sold
for energy; SOeS; ADEME)
• Volume of wood used by the construction/renovation sector (Source: DHUP)
