Foreword 
 
In the Carpathian Basin in Hungary, we are experiencing the negative impacts of climate 
change—the most significant environmental, economic, and social problem of our time. The 
world we leave to our children and grandchildren solely depends on us. Therefore, instead of 
empty words, it is time to act. Hungary and the Hungarian government are committed to 
leading the way and choosing the path of action. 
 
In  January  2020,  we  set  definite  strategic  targets  in  the  field  of  climate  change  and 
environmental protection. We adopted the first Climate Change Action Plan that contains 
concrete measures for achieving the medium- and long-term goals of the Second National 
Climate Change Strategy. The National Energy and Climate Plan for the period up to 2030 
and the new National Energy Strategy both contain clear objectives for the medium term. In 
the above documents, we pledge to make 90% of our electricity generation carbon-free by 
2030. Besides reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we are also committed to strengthening 
energy  security,  reinforcing  climate  protection,  and  expanding  economic  development. 
Specific interventions of the Climate and Nature Protection Action Plan, adopted in 2020, 
also support environmental protection targets. The Climate Protection Act, also adopted last 
year,  sets  the  goal  to  achieve  climate  neutrality  by  2050.  Finally,  the  National  Clean 
Development Strategy, presented herewith outlines the pathways toward climate neutrality 
and confirms that the Hungarian government is taking concrete actions to combat climate 
change. With this background, Hungary is clearly choosing a clean future that follows the 
path of climate protection, energy sovereignty, and green economic development.  
  
In the field of climate protection, Hungary pursues a reasonable and responsible policy. 
Climate neutrality must be achieved in a way that ensures the security of supply, a just 
transition, and economic development. The government insists that primarily the biggest 
polluters need to pay the cost of the transition and that increased utility costs for families 
must be avoided. Achieving the transition will not be an easy task. The following 30 years 
toward climate neutrality will be challenging since we are trying to reach a goal with some 
uncertainty along the way. What this transition means to our everyday lives is not yet fully 
clear, but we must stay on track with our common climate goal lighting the way.  
 
Our country starts off from a favorable position on the journey toward climate neutrality. 
Hungary’s performance is outstanding compared to other European and global emission 
levels. Since 2000, Hungary is one of the few countries that have managed to increase its 
GDP while reducing CO  emissions and energy consumption. The Hungarian economy has, 
2
in fact, been able to produce a unit of GDP with 24% less greenhouse gas emissions when 
compared to 2010 levels. The National Clean Development Strategy serves as a torch on the 
road toward a cleaner future, economic development, and improved social welfare.

Executive Summary  
Our country has expressed efforts to support achieving climate neutrality by 2050 with the 
adoption of Act no. XLIV of 2020 on Climate Protection. The National Clean Development 
Strategy (NCDS or Strategy) outlines a 30-year vision of socioeconomic and technological 
development  pathways.  Hungary’s  long-term  Strategy  will  help  reach  climate  neutrality 
targets while focusing on the well-being of the Hungarian people and ensuring the protection 
of natural assets and economic development.  
Hungary starts this endeavor from a strong position, being among the few countries since 
1990 where the gross domestic product (GDP) has increased while CO emissions decreased, 
2 
by 33%. This confirms that climate protection, economic growth, and energy security are not 
necessarily conflicting objectives. By this, the long-term vision contributes to the United 
Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by i) “Providing affordable, reliable, 
sustainable and modern energy for everyone,” ii) “Creating sustainable consumption and 
production patterns,” and iii) “Fighting climate change and its impacts with urgent response 
measures.” 
The NCDS was based on a wide stakeholder consultation process.  
To outline the long-term trajectory, an integrated modeling approach was used to explore the 
specificities of the sectors as well as the system-wide and cross-sectoral dynamics of the 
decarbonization  process.  The  development  of  projections  was  helped  by  applying  two 
models: 
1)  The Green Economy Model (GEM) is an intersectoral model that uses system dynamics 
as  its  foundation.  This  methodology  supports  the  estimation  of  the  macroeconomic 
outcomes of decarbonization, including the economic evaluation of several social and 
environmental externalities in addition to changes in the labor market.  
2)  The HU-TIMES model was used iteratively with the GEM to simulate the energy sector 
and to outline the emission routes of the energy and industrial sectors. TIMES is a 
bottom-up, partial  equilibrium  optimization  model used  to 
analyze the different pathways of energy flow within the energy subsectors. 
 
Three main scenarios for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions up to 2050 have been developed 
and analyzed:  
1) Business-as-usual (BAU) scenario: The emission trajectory of the BAU scenario follows 
current trends, assuming that all existing sectoral policy strategies and measures remain in 
effect, and that there will be no new interventions. 
2) Late action (LA) climate neutrality scenario: This scenario aims to reduce emissions in 
the energy sector at a delayed and slower pace until 2045, and then with an increased effort 
until 2050. This allows the lower cost levels of low and zero emission technologies to be 
exploited. The scenario assumes that, in line with the targets set in the climate act, the final 
energy consumption could reach a maximum of 785 petajoules (PJ) in 2030, with the share of 
renewable energy increasing to at least 21%. After 2030, non-waste sectors will be on the 
lowest cost trajectory toward climate neutrality until 2050, which will result in accelerated 
emission reductions by 2050, due to the postponement of investments pending on a decrease 
in technology costs.  
3) Early action (EA) climate neutrality scenario: the EA approach envisages achieving 
climate neutrality by 2050 while considering the short- and medium-term benefits of job 
  8      
 
creation and a reduction of environmental externalities, the economic potential of the first 
mover,  improved  productivity,  and  higher  GDP  growth.  The  EA  scenario  assumes  that 
Hungary's  final  energy  consumption  in  2030  will  be  a  maximum  of  734  PJ,  and  that 
renewable  energy  penetration  will  reach  27%.  The  emission  reduction  trajectories for 
industry;  land-use,  land-use  change  and  forestry  (LULUCF);  waste  management;  and 
agriculture are the same as in the LA scenario. Between 2030 and 2050, emissions will 
follow a linear trajectory to reach net zero emissions. 
In  both  the  LA  and  EA  scenarios,  carbon  capture,  utilization, and  storage  (CCUS) 
technologies will become commercially viable in the energy and industrial sectors after 
2030.  
According to the modeling results, GHG emissions in the BAU scenario will decrease to only 
56  million  tons  of  CO   equivalent  (CO eq)/year,  from  2019  levels.  Therefore,  a 
2 2
considerably stronger effort will be needed to achieve the 2050 climate neutrality target1 
than the policies and measures currently in effect.  
According to both climate neutrality scenarios, net zero emissions will be reached by 
mid-century. However, the clean energy transition will vary based on different assumptions, 
and the generation of socioeconomic benefits will differ in their development pathways 
(Figure 1).

Figure 1 – Expected change of total annual net GHG emissions for the whole economy under 
the three scenarios examined (CO eq/year)  
2
During its December 10–11, 2020 session, the European Council decided to increase GHG 
reduction targets to 55% by 2030.2 Both climate neutrality scenarios of this Strategy fulfill 
this increased target.  
The emission reductions of the two scenarios will diverge during the mid-2020s, with a 
difference exceeding 800,000 tons of CO eq by 2030.  
2
The EA scenario will require stronger mitigation efforts; however the increased investments 
                                                 
1 Domestic emissions and absorption will be in balance by 2050

EUCO 22/20, CO EUR 17, CONCL 8 
  9      
 
will boost country’s economic growth. The end-user demand will increase including the 
demand for traveling and buying household appliances.  
The  EA  scenario  follows  a  more  gradual  emission  reduction  pathway  since  the 
investments  serving  the  energy  transition  and  decarbonization  are  carried  out  sooner. 
Furthermore,  the  EA  scenario  is  characterized  by  an  accelerated  larger-scale  “clean” 
electrification and decarbonization of the electricity system. 
The sectoral distribution of GHG emission reductions under different scenarios is illustrated 
in Figure 2.

Figure 2 – Sectoral distribution of net GHG emissions under the three scenarios examined 
(CO eq/year)

The emissions of the energy sector, being the largest GHG-emitting sector, will fall under 1.7 
million tons of CO eq/year according to the EA scenario. The LA scenario also forecasts 
2
emissions under 2 million tons of CO eq/year (the expected emissions is 1.9 million tons of 
2
CO eq/year) by mid-century. In contrast, according to the BAU scenario, the emissions of the 
2
energy sector can only be decreased to 29 million tons of CO eq/year with already adopted 
2
and applied interventions and policies.  
In the EA scenario, sectoral emissions after 2030 are consistently lower than in the LA 
scenario. Emissions from industrial processes are higher toward the end of the period, which 
can  be  explained  by  the  larger-scale  economic  growth  and  the  increase  in  industrial 
productivity provided by the EA scenario.  
Natural sink capacities will be expanded to balance out the remaining emissions in 2050. It is 
forecasted in the EA and LA scenarios that 4.5 million tons of CO eq/year will be naturally 
2
absorbed, mainly due to the increasing forest coverage. Without additional interventions, 
however  (according  to  the  BAU  scenario),  forests  will  become  net  emitters  (the  GHG 
emissions of forests can reach a net 140,000–145,000 tons of CO eq/year). 
2
The energy sector including the energy supply and the energy consumption of the industry 
and transport sectors and others (such as tertiary or residential sectors)  has the most 
significant role in reducing emissions. This is because the energy sector accounts for 70% 
of total emissions and has the largest potential to reduce emissions (Figure 3). Consequently, 
drastic changes are needed to decarbonize Hungary’s energy supply system (including 
  10      
 
energy  generation  capacities)  and  to  enable  the  end-user  side  to  reduce  energy 
consumption and utilize clean energy technologies.  
Under the BAU scenario, the final energy consumption between 2016 and 2050 can be 
reduced  from  733  PJ  to  662  PJ.  However,  this  would  not  be  enough  to  reach  climate 
neutrality by 2050. The final energy consumption is forecasted to be 538 PJ and 484 PJ 
by 2050 according to the EA and LA scenarios, respectively. In the former case, the 
higher energy consumption is explained by the larger-scale economic growth indicated by the 
EA scenario.  
Looking at a sectoral distribution (Figure 3), the households (residential) sector has the 
largest energy saving potential.

Figure 3 – Composition of final energy consumption by sector under the three scenarios 
examined, 2016–2050 (PJ)3 
Even the BAU scenario shows reductions in  household  energy consumption  due to  the 
significantly lower energy use of new household appliances, newly built and energy-efficient 
buildings,  and  renovations  and  retrofits  to  existing  buildings.  As  a  result,  the  energy 
consumption of nearly 260 PJ in 2016 will drop under 160 PJ by 2050 in the BAU scenario. 
This value will be even considerably lower in the climate neutrality scenarios, where the 
household energy consumption will decrease to approximately 70 PJ by 2050.   
The energy consumption of the industrial sector is different in the three examined 
scenarios. In the BAU scenario, the increase in energy consumption is dominant due to the 
higher GDP, which will be compensated by energy efficiency investments. A consistently 
decreasing trend can be observed from 2030 onward. Overall, the two climate neutrality 
scenarios show a decreasing trend; however, some increase is forecasted until 2030. 
After 2030, energy consumption in the EA scenario will decrease at a lower rate than in 
the LA scenario. This is explained by higher GDP growth and therefore higher industrial 
productivity in the EA scenario.

The service and transport sectors follow similar trajectories in the climate neutrality 
scenarios. In the BAU scenario, the energy consumption of both sectors slightly increases. 
The two climate neutrality scenarios show a 10–20% reduction compared to the current 
levels, due to energy efficiency investments and the use of more efficient fuels.  
The fuel mix of the final energy consumption (Figure 4) must change significantly to 
reach the 2050 climate neutrality target. There is no significant shift of the fuel mix in the 
BAU scenario; however, the share of natural  gas is  increasing, which overshadows the 
renewable energy sources.

Figure 4 – Final energy consumption by fuel type under the three scenarios examined, 2016–
2050 (PJ)  
The most significant change caused by the two climate neutrality scenarios is due to large-
scale electrification. For the EA scenario, the use of electricity accounts for over half of the 
total energy consumption, which is similar to the rate of the LA scenario.  
As a result of electrification in the transport sector, the consumption of oil-based fuels will 
decrease  drastically—to  nearly  a  quarter  of  the  current  level—by  2050  in  the  climate 
neutrality scenarios. The other significant change, which will start in the 2040s, is the 
decline  in  natural  gas  consumption and  the  complete  disappearance  thereof  in  some 
sectors. Natural gas is partly replaced by hydrogen, mainly in the transport and industrial 
sectors. By 2040, hydrogen will already play an important role in both climate neutrality 
scenarios. By 2050, hydrogen will account for 11% and 15% of final energy consumption in 
the EA and LA scenarios, respectively.  
To achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050, based on currently available technological 
developments, efforts are needed in the following areas: 
1)  Energy efficiency improvement in all fields of the national economy and establishment 
of a circular economy; 
2)  Electrification in all areas of the economy, based on domestic nuclear and renewable 
energy sources;  
3)  Application of CCUS technologies in the energy sector and in high emitting industrial 
facilities; 
4)  Use of hydrogen and upscaling of the related hydrogen technologies;  
  12      
 
5)  Sustainable utilization of bioenergy (within limits); 
6)  Sustainable, modern, and innovative agriculture;  
7)  Increase in natural sink capacities, mainly through the absorption of CO  by forests 
2
and maintaining forests as the most potential natural sinks as well as rethinking 
economic and financial incentives for forestry; and 
8)  Research,  development,  and  innovation  as  well  as  corresponding  education  and 
training programs. 
 
Main directions for interventions: 
  Support is needed for residential energy saving. 
  Acceleration and expansion of energy efficiency investments are necessary, especially in the 
residential and commercial sectors. 
  Significant investments will be needed to electrify the economy, especially in the transport, 
residential, and commercial sectors. One of the main conditions for the electrification of the 
economy is the modernization and climate-friendly transformation of the energy sector.  
  Further investment will be necessary in the development of CCUS technology, as well as in 
the increasing the utilization of renewable energy sources and energy storage systems. 
Given  carbon  phase-out  efforts,  new  investment  in  fossil  fuel-based  technologies  and 
industries runs the risk of rapidly depreciating assets (i.e. stranded assets). 
  Besides more efficient industrial processes and product use (IPPU), CCUS technologies 
and alternatives to replace fossil energy sources (as raw material feedstocks) are needed in 
the future. These alternatives can be carbon-free or low-carbon hydrogen and its derivatives 
as well as alternative biological raw materials. Furthermore, raising public awareness to 
shape consumption patterns and promoting the transition to a circular economy will have a 
significant positive impact on industrial emissions.  
  Besides the electrification of the transport sector, expanding the application of second-
generation (or advanced) biofuels and hydrogen, as well as the more efficient usage of fuels 
and  the  gradual  decrease  in  using  liquefied  petroleum  gas  (LPG)  on  the  market,  will 
contribute to decarbonizing and modernizing the sector.  
  In the agricultural sector, a reduction in fertilizer use; a more efficient use of organic 
fertilizers; and a wider application of precision farming, automatization, and digitalization 
will be needed. Moreover, investments targeting feeding, irrigation, and energy efficiency are 
key requirements. The LULUCF sector will require significant investments to enhance net 
CO  capture (sink capacities) after 2030. This will be especially needed for measures that 
2
improve forest adaptation, reduce logging in the medium term, and increase afforestation 
efforts in the long term. For sustainable forestry, the maintenance of stocks with the most 
optimal CO  equilibrium and business model (regarding area and age structure) needs to be 
2
emphasized. Furthermore, interventions should support maintaining and developing forests 
while protecting their natural levels despite climate change impacts.  
  The  waste  sector  will  require  significant  investments  to  drastically  reduce  landfilling. 
Reducing landfills, diverging waste flows, and improving waste treatment methods account 
for around 90% of the emission reductions of the sector. Further investments will be needed 
to reduce the amount of industrial waste, to improve municipal waste treatment, and to 
  13      
 
prevent  waste  in  the  first  place.  To  reduce  emissions  in  waste  management,  additional 
investments are necessary in other sectors (e.g., in the transport sector because of waste 
transport, or in the energy sector because of nonrecyclable waste combustion).  
  Research, development, and innovation will be one of the main pillars of achieving our 
energy and climate goals. Through the research development and further improvement of 
new  technologies  and  processes,  as  well  as  their  market  introduction,  a  degree  of  cost 
reduction can be achieved to greatly help the spread of clean technologies. 
  The education and (re)training of professionals capable of developing and/or applying new 
technologies and processes is also crucial to reach climate neutrality. 
Cost-benefit analysis  
In order to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, significant investments will be required in the 
upcoming decades. However the possible benefits of decarbonizing the national economy 
in the medium and long term will exceed these costs (Table 1).  
According to the EA scenario, the investment costs will be HUF 24.7 billion4 higher 
compared  to  the  BAU  scenario.  Conversely,  the  additional  cost  according  to  the  LA 
scenario is HUF 13.7 billion. The difference between the two scenarios originates in the 
energy sector. The additional annual investment need accounts for 4.8% of the GDP in the 
EA scenario.  
Based on the analysis,  the  full decarbonization of the Hungarian economy will  also 
generate significant avoided costs and added economic benefits. Assessing the period up 
to 2050, the value of avoided costs and added benefits are observed to exceed the investment 
costs. Moreover, these avoided costs and additional benefits will continue to occur well after 
2050; however, this is not discussed in this document. Considering avoided costs and 
added benefits, the EA scenario is the most cost-effective scenario.  
Investing in the green transition brings macroeconomic benefits that lead to significant boost 
in economic growth and create additional green jobs compared to the BAU scenario.  
Based on the EA scenario, the cumulated surplus GDP amounts to approximately HUF 19.8 
billion—but only HUF 11.2 billion based on the LA scenario (Table 1, Figure 5). The 
government revenues are forecasted to increase by HUF 11.1 billion cumulatively in the 
EA scenario (while the LA scenario shows a growth of HUF 6.2 billion).

Table 1 – Cost-benefit analysis for the periods 2020–2050 (additional costs and benefits 
compared to the BAU scenario) 
According to the analysis, economic growth will be considerably higher after 2028. By 2034, 
the  GDP  and  GDP  growth  trajectory  will  follow  a  similar  path  for  the  BAU  and  EA 
scenarios. According to the EA scenario, it is estimated that the annual GDP growth will 
amount to an average 2.9%5 between 2021 and 2050. The expected growth rate in the 
same period is 2.5% in the BAU scenario.   
Early investments identified by the EA scenario and the gradual and consistent reduction of 
emissions will result in a 20.7% higher GDP by 2050, compared to the BAU scenario. The 
difference between the BAU and the LA scenario is only 11.3% (Figure 5).

In addition, according to the EA scenario, the carbon intensity of the Hungarian economy 
will gradually decrease from 1.6 tons of CO eq/million HUF in 2016 to zero in 2050, while 
2
in the BAU scenario, a carbon intensity of 0.6 tons of CO eq/million HUF is expected by 
2
2050 (Figure 6).

According to the analysis, the decarbonization of the national economy creates new jobs in 
the analyzed sectors. The EA scenario indicates nearly 183,000 new jobs created by 2050 
compared to the BAU scenario, while the LA scenario shows only a third of this number. 
Through appropriate education and (re)training programs, the Hungarian economy 
can benefit from a green transition.  
The analysis of the scenarios up to 2050 reveals that the BAU scenario does not meet the 
increased 2030 GHG emissions reduction target nor the 2050 climate neutrality target 
set in Act no. XLIV of 2020 on Climate Protection. However, the cost-benefit analysis 
shows  that  the  EA  scenario  brings  considerably  more  economic  and  employment 
benefits than does the LA scenario. At the same time, the EA scenario moderates the 
  16      
 
uncertainty of the technological transition, which is strongly present in the LA scenario. 
Furthermore, accelerating the energy transition and the early implementation of investments 
can incentivize a recovery from the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Therefore, in subchapter 4.2, which presents sector-specific results, the focus will be on 
a comparison between the BAU and EA scenarios.

1. Long-term Vision and Guiding Principles of the National Climate Strategy 
The objective of the NCDS is to outline the socioeconomic and technological pathways 
toward achieving the 2050 climate neutrality target, which has been enshrined in law by 
Act no. XLIV  of  2020  on  Climate  Protection.6 The  Strategy  prioritizes  the  prosperity, 
growth, and well-being of Hungarian families by integrating development and well-being 
goals  into  measures  that  prevent  negative  impacts  or  prepare  for  the  unavoidable 
consequences of climate change. 
Clean development is a model of development that nurtures sustainable economic growth and 
creates green jobs and economic development opportunities while minimizing environmental 
pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The emissions reduction pathways presented in the 
NCDS integrate currently available and future technological solutions and show that it is 
possible to achieve the 2050 climate neutrality target in a socially just and cost-efficient 
way.   
While achieving climate neutrality requires significant effort in all sectors of the national 
economy, action  by  the  polluting  industries  and  the  private  sector  is essential. The 
government of Hungary is determined to ensure that the biggest polluters pay for the majority 
of the costs associated with the transition and that Hungarian families do not bear the costs of 
the transition. Although climate neutrality requires significant investments, it also presents 
major welfare opportunities for the next 30 years and after  by laying the foundation 
for sustainable economic growth.   
Although  the  green  transition offers  unique  opportunities, it  also  holds 
challenges and temporary trade-offs. For this reason, the Strategy emphasizes a just transition 
through  which  everyone  shares its benefits  despite  facing  temporary  difficulties. By 
undertaking this approach, the NCDS promotes public acceptance of ambitious climate action 
by demonstrating that the benefits can compensate for the negative impacts associated with 
the climate mitigation measures.  
The  long-term  vision  of  the  NCDS  should  be  underpinned  by  promoting  research, 
development,  and  innovation  as  well  as  continuous  improvement  at all  levels 
through education and training and enhancing green finance opportunities.   
Hungary starts this endeavor from a strong position, being among the few countries to prove 
that economic growth and climate protection are not necessarily conflicting objectives. Since 
the 1990s, the GDP of Hungary has increased while CO  emissions and energy consumption 
2
decreased by 33% and 15%, respectively. In 2020, Hungary became the first country in the 
Central Eastern European region and the seventh in the world to adopt a climate neutrality 
target in the form of a law with the adoption of Act no. XLIV of 2020 on Climate Protection 
by the National Assembly. Hungary is now determined to implement its climate neutrality 
goal by taking concrete steps.  
The NCDS refines the path outlined in the medium term in the Second National Climate 
Change Strategy (NCCS-2) adopted in 2018 as well as in the National Energy and Climate 
Plan (NECP) and the National Energy Strategy (NES), both adopted in 2020.   
The NCDS is the result of extensive stakeholder consultations, as well as robust modeling 
and analysis of future low-carbon scenarios, which allowed the exploration of the impacts of 
policy  and  technological  interventions  regarding  socioeconomic  objectives. The  NCDS

provides a forward-looking vision of the transformation that is needed to meet the 2050 goal 
and  reduce  the  risk  of  stranded  assets  while  avoiding  carbon-intensive  lock-ins  in 
infrastructure.  
Hungary is pursuing the following long-term goals by 2050 in all key sectors:  
  Energy: a  decarbonized  clean,  smart,  and  affordable  energy  sector for  the 
Hungarian  people  and  businesses  that  is  decentralized,  efficient,  secure, 
interconnected, sovereign, and builds upon renewable and nuclear energy. The energy 
sector will store and utilize any remaining carbon emissions as well as weather-
dependently produced energy. The decarbonization of the energy system will provide 
green jobs and help people financially by making them “prosumers.”  
  Transport: a more sustainable, greener, safer, and better-connected transport 
system supported by high-tech infrastructure and built on the right balance between 
public and private transport while recognizing the right to choose one’s travel method. 
It will incentivize low-carbon transport modes and provide cleaner air, less noise 
pollution, and safer living spaces.   
  Industry  and  businesses: a climate-friendly,  innovative,  and  knowledge-based 
industry and circular economy where Hungarian high-tech and green small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have a leading role. Undertaking the transition 
based on this Strategy will make Hungarian SMEs and industry the biggest winners of 
the green transition, further contributing to clean economic development and the well-
being of Hungarian people.  
  Agriculture: a healthy, productive, climate-resilient, and high-quality agriculture 
sector that  ensures  food  security  for  all  Hungarians  and  an  efficient  market 
environment that can produce items for export. In the beginning of the 2030s, a digital 
era will gain ground in zero-pollution, circular, and waste-free agriculture based on 
the  toolset  of  Agriculture  5.0  (robotics,  drone-based  remote  sensing,  and 
automatization;  industrial  production  of  protein,  carbohydrates,  and  bioactive 
material; molecular farming; functional soil and manure; functional food and feed 
production; and bioherbicides and biopesticides).   
  LULUCF: healthy  and  climate-resilient  forests  and  grasslands. Similar to 
agriculture, geographic information systems, digitalization, and automatization tools 
of farming will gain ground. The afforestation programs will utilize more resilient 
variants  of  local  native  tree  species.  Natural  sink  capacities  that  are  essential 
to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 will be maintained and expanded.  
  Waste: a clean country with minimum or nearly zero waste. Being the smallest 
GHG-emitting sector and in line with the European Union (EU) circular economy 
targets, waste should be treated as raw material and must be reduced, reused, and 
recycled to the fullest extent.  
  Financing: a financial sector that is in harmony with sustainability and aligned 
with the climate neutrality goals as well as a climate-friendly budgetary policy 
that supports green economic growth. The flow of public and private funds is 
consistent  with  the  financial  needs  of  national  green  and  climate  protection 
investments.     
To maximize benefits during the transition and translate the vision and values of Hungarians, 
the following guiding principles lead policy-making in the respective areas:   
  19      
 
  Contextuality: National  policies  and  measures  shall  be  aligned  with  Hungary’s 
commitments under international and EU laws.  
  Unity: The proposed measures shall be valid in the context of the whole Carpathian 
Basin, since it forms an integrated ecosystem.  
  Comprehensiveness: Actions shall equally fulfill the challenges ahead of the national 
environment, society, and economy. Interventions that prevent the negative impacts of 
climate change are equally important as measures that foster behavior change.   
  Utilization  of  zero-carbon  energy  sources: A climate-neutral  Hungarian 
economy shall be  built on  the  utilization of  renewable  energy  sources  as  well  as 
on nuclear capacities. The 2050 climate neutrality target cannot be reached without 
the utilization of nuclear energy, thus both sources need to be considered.   
  The  “polluter  pays”  principle,  environmental  responsibility, 
and social fairness: The costs of the green transition should be primarily borne by 
the highest-emitting companies. Therefore, proposed measures should be based on 
proportional and reasonable logic.   
  Cost-efficiency: Commitments  shall  be  met  at  the  lowest  possible  net  cost  to 
Hungarian taxpayers, consumers, and businesses.  
  Maximizing benefits: The social and economic benefits for Hungary from the green 
transition shall be maximized.  
  Sovereignty and security of supply: Only those actions and policy options that 
respect  Hungary’s  sovereign  decision-making  power,  energy  independence,  and 
security of supply shall be considered.  
  Application of research, development, and innovation and the development of 
the  related  education  training  background: Promoting  technologies  and  low-
carbon solutions that innovatively facilitate the green transition is of key importance 
to meet the climate targets. Therefore, it is essential to improve skills and knowledge 
related to the development, production, installation, and application of new solutions. 
  Sustainability: Only  those  technologies  and  low-carbon  solutions  that  are 
ecologically and socially sustainable will be promoted.   
  Sustainable  land  use: Maintaining  biologically  active  areas  will  be  emphasized 
while utilizing land use measures under the NCDS.  
   
  20      
 
2. Policy and Legal Context 
In 2015, under the historic Paris Agreement, all nations agreed to actively participate in 
combating climate change. Article 4 of the Paris Agreement clearly states that the long-term 
goal of the collective efforts is “to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by 
sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the 
basis  of  equity,  and  in  the  context  of  sustainable  development  and  efforts  to 
eradicate poverty.” This balance (i.e., climate neutrality) - based on the Special Report7 by 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - is to be achieved globally by 2050, 
to avoid the worst effects of climate change.  
According to the United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report 
20198, global GHG emissions continue to rise. Over the last 10 years, GHG emissions have 
risen at a rate of 1.5% per year, and in 2018, GHGs achieved record highs. Based on the 
report, there is no sign of GHG emissions peaking in the next few years, and every year of 
postponed peaking means that deeper and faster cuts will be required. According to the 
Emissions Gap Report 2019, by 2030, global emissions would need to be 25% and 55% 
lower than in 2018 to put the world on the least-cost pathway to limit global warming to 
below 2˚C and 1.5°C, respectively. This could only be tackled effectively if all countries do 
their fair share based on their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective 
capabilities considering national circumstances as stated by the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).   
Hungary is leading by example, although it is only responsible for approximately 0.15% of 
global GHG emissions. Hungary has adopted ambitious commitments under the first and 
second  commitment  periods  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  which  have  been  significantly 
overachieved. According to the 2020 National Inventory Report9, compared to the Kyoto 
base year (average of 1985–87) and to the internationally used base year of 1990, Hungarian 
GHG emissions in 2018 were lower by 43% and 33%, respectively. Hungary was the first 
country within the EU whose parliament unanimously voted to ratify the Paris Agreement. In 
December 2019, Hungary voted in favor of the EU 2050 climate neutrality target, and the 
Hungarian  parliament  adopted Act  no.  XLIV  of  2020  on  Climate  Protection, which 
contains the legally binding obligation for the country to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. 
This complies with the international benchmark and the necessary targets proposed by the 
scientific community.   
It should be noted that climate change is not the only environmental and social challenge that 
the world and Hungary are facing and which requires concerted global action. To address the 
most important problems under one comprehensive framework, the United Nations General 
Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development10 in 2015.

eradicate poverty.

As a Member State of the EU since 2004,  EU policies and legal environment are greatly 
relevant in the Hungarian context. The EU has started an exemplary transition process with 
the adoption of the common 2050 climate neutrality goal and the initiation of the European 
Green Deal (EGD). The current EU-level environmental and climate protection regulations 
in  force  and  the  ongoing  elaboration and  implementation of  the  EGD fundamentally 
influence  the opportunities and  policy decisions of  Hungary.  Consequently,  during  the 
elaboration and implementation of the NCDS, this legal context played an influential role and 
is referred to in this text; however, a detailed description of it is outside the scope of this 
Strategy. To present  the policy and legal  context  of the NCDS,  Annex 2 lists the most 
relevant international EU-level and national documents. If the necessary innovations, energy 
efficiency measures, human resources, and industrial and renewable capacities are realized in 
Hungary and the EU before other regions, it will ensure a first mover advantage. The same 
applies to Hungary in comparison with other EU Member States.  
The Hungarian government strongly believes that enhanced regional cooperation will be key 
to achieve and maintain climate neutrality. As a member of the Visegrad Four Group (V4) - 
alongside Czechia, Poland, and Slovakia  Hungary is planning to reinforce its climate  and 
environmentally  related  efforts  within  the  group  to  determine  effective  and  mutually 
beneficial local and regional policies and measures. 
   
  22      
 
3. Process of Concept Development, Stakeholder Engagement and Public Consultation  
The NCDS was based on a wide stakeholder consultation process involving professional 
and civil society groups and organizations. The responsible entity for the elaboration of 
the long-term Strategy was the Ministry for Innovation and Technology (MIT), which deeply 
involved the relevant ministries and other governmental and nongovernmental actors in the 
process of developing this document. The most important consultation forum within the 
government was the Interministerial Working Group on Climate Change. The government 
reached out broadly and inclusively to public and key stakeholders. MIT carried out an online 
public consultation November 18–25, 2019, which consisted of a survey on the government 
website  targeting  all  Hungarians.  More  than  200,000  answers  were  received,  and  the 
proposals contributed to the NCDS. A detailed summary of the public consultation outcomes 
was shared on the government website.  
The  Hungarian  government  adopted  a  draft  version  of  the  present long-term  concept in 
January 2020, which was available on the websites of the government and the European 
Commission. Based on this draft, MIT continued and broadened the discussion on the NCDS 
throughout 2020 by organizing the so-called “Climate Breakfasts”. Through this online event 
series, stakeholders from the private sector, financial institutions, and civil society groups 
including youth organizations provided contributions on the national climate neutrality target 
and associated challenges, opportunities, and needs. The detailed written proposals of the 
stakeholders have been incorporated into the final version of the Strategy. 
MIT also involved the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) as an independent international 
strategic advisor in the process and utilized GGGI’s broad experience in formulating country-
level clean and green growth strategies. Under the framework of this cooperation, three 
consultation  workshops  have  been  organized  to  validate  the  modeling  results  and 
discuss sectoral policies and priorities. A comprehensive list of the consultations carried 
out can be found in Annex 3, whereas a description of the stakeholder engagement and public 
involvement in the future revisions of the NCDS can be found in Chapter 7.  
 
Stakeholder consultations  
 
(Annex 7 contains the main suggestions for the strategic environmental assessment of the NCDS based on the 
Government Regulation 2/2005 (I. 11.))  
 
The  elaboration  of  economy-wide  and  sectoral  decarbonization  pathways  was  partly  based  on  different 
stakeholder inputs:  
 
i)  Consultations with the representatives of the private sector and civil society groups were carried out within 
the framework of the „Climate Breakfasts”. This online event-series made it possible for sectoral actors to 
share their views and best practices. The inputs provided were taken into account during the modelling of 
low carbon development scenarios of the NCDS.   
 
ii)  Under the development of the NCDS, three consultative workshops were organized where different areas of 
expertise and the academia had the opportunity to share their views of the modelling as well as to validate 
the low-carbon scenarios.

4. GHG Emissions, Policies, and Measures; Their Socioeconomic Impacts and Related 
Green Growth Opportunities; and Adaptation to the Inevitable Effects of Climate 
Change  
4.1. Economy-wide trajectories for GHG emissions  
4.1.1. Historical trends in GHG emissions and their current key sources  
According to the latest available data, total GHG emissions in Hungary in 2018 was 63.2 
million tons of CO eq, excluding the LULUCF sector. At the same time, net emissions, 
2
including the LULUCF sector, amounted to 58.6 million tons of CO eq. Although the level of 
2
emissions did not change significantly between 2017 and 2018, the upward trend of previous 
years was broken, and there was a decrease of almost 1%, with emissions being 33% below 
the 1990 level. 
It is a positive trend that after the downturn following the regime change, the country's GDP 
has been growing steadily, while GHG emissions have not increased overall  (i.e., GDP 
growth  and  emissions  have  been  decoupled).  The  split  between  GHG  emissions  and 
economic development points to the fact that the objectives of economic development 
and climate protection are not incompatible. (Figure 7).

Gross GHG emissions per capita are 6.5 tons of CO eq/capita/year, the sixth lowest in the EU

(2018), well below the European average (Figure 8) and the best performance among the V4 
countries.

The 33% reduction in emissions by 2018 was a consequence of the political and economic 
regime change of 1989-90, which resulted in a radical decline in production in all sectors of 
the national economy in the early 1990s. However, after fourteen years of stagnation (1992–
2005), GHG emissions significantly decreased by approximately 25% between 2005 and 
2013—the global economic crisis of 2008–2009 accounted for approximately 9% of this 
decrease.  The  subsequent  economic  recovery  temporarily  put  emissions  on  an  upward 
trajectory again from 2013: an increase of 12% was observed until 2017, but total emissions 
decreased again in 2018 (Table 2).

Table 2 – GHG emission trends without the LULUCF sector (million tons of CO eq/year)

CO  accounts for 78–79% of all anthropogenic GHG emissions. The main source of CO  
2 2
emissions is the use of fossil fuels for energy purposes including in the transport sector. 
Methane is responsible for 12% of emissions, of which its main source is landfills and 
livestock farms. Nitrogen oxides represent approximately 8% of emissions and are largely 
derived from the use of fertilizers. The remaining 2% are fluorine gases. 
Regarding the distribution of gross emissions by sector (Figure 10), the energy sector is by 
far the most responsible for GHG emissions, accounting for 72% in 2018. However, a 
positive trend in fossil fuel use is that the share of coal has fallen from 30% to 10% in the last 
thirty years. By 2018, transport became the largest emitter, not only within the energy 
sector but of all subsectors, accounting for 22% of Hungary’s emissions. Road transport 
dominates emissions within transport, which have risen by almost 40% in the last five years. 
IPPU are the second largest emissions contributor, while agriculture is the third largest 
emitting sector, both of which account for approximately 11% of total emissions. In 
2018, 37% of industrial emissions came from the chemical industry, while 19% were due to 
the use of ozone-depleting substances. The mineral and metal industries contributed 19% and 
20% to emissions in the industrial sector, respectively. Other product use (4%) and non-
energy use of fuels (1%) accounted for the smallest share. 
  25      
 
The share of agriculture in total emissions has not changed significantly in the last 30 
years (10–11%). The waste sector accounted for the smallest share of emissions (5%), 
but overall, this sector alone has increased GHG emissions since 1985 by a total of 7%. 
The LULUCF sector varies greatly from  year to year, mainly due to natural processes. 
Between 1990 and 2018, the sector removed an average of 3.8 million tons of CO eq per year 
2
from the atmosphere. In 2018, this amounted to 4.7 million tons, which is about 7% of the 
gross emissions. This was largely due to forests’ sequestration. 
 
4.1.2. Economy-wide decarbonization pathways until 2050  
Achieving climate neutrality by 2050 will require significant investment in all sectors of 
the economy in the coming decades. However, the medium- and long-term benefits of 
decarbonizing  the  national  economy  outweigh  these  costs.  Investing  in  low-carbon 
technologies and infrastructure will not only contribute to the 2050 climate neutrality goal but 
also to other national development goals, including environmental sustainability, security of 
energy supply, and the health and well-being of the Hungarian people. 
The lessons of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic clearly illustrate that it is more 
economically advantageous to develop prevention strategies than to do costly repairs for the 
damage caused retrospectively. Early action to reduce GHG emissions is far more beneficial 
than bearing the material consequences of climate change later. 
The  identification  of  different  pathways  to  climate  neutrality  in  2050  is  based  on 
comprehensive integrated modeling across the economy. A wide range of stakeholders have 
been  involved  in  the  modeling  and  conceptualization  process,  including  experts  from 
ministries  and  background  institutions,  as  well  as  representatives  of  the  private  sector, 
covering all sectors. The consultations carried out are presented in Annex 3. 
To outline the long-term trajectory, an integrated modeling approach was used to explore the 
specificities  of  the  sectors  and  the  system-wide  and  cross-sectoral  dynamics  of  the 
decarbonization process: 
  The  GEM  is  an intersectoral  model that  uses  Systems  Thinking  and  System 
Dynamics  as  its  foundations. This  integrated  model  -  which  considers  the 
interlinkages  existing  between  populations,  economic activity, and  environmental 
outcomes - has been customized for Hungary for the assessment of various economy-
wide  emission reduction pathways.  Therefore, it  supports  the  estimation 
of the macroeconomic outcomes of  decarbonization,  including  the  economic 
valuation of several social and environmental externalities, in addition to job gains 
and losses.   
  The HU-TIMES model was used iteratively with the GEM to model the energy 
sector and to outline the emission routes of the energy and industrial sectors. TIMES 
is  a  bottom-up, partial  equilibrium  optimization  model used  to 
analyze the different pathways of  energy  flow  within  the energy  subsectors 
(i.e., transformation, industry, commercial and residential, agriculture, and transport 
sectors) by taking into consideration the assumptions for exogenous demand for all 
these subsectors, the current  and  future  available technologies, and the economic 
environment  (e.g.,  GDP,  population, emissions  trading  system  (ETS), and  fuel 
prices). Besides the energy flow, the HU-TIMES model can provide technology and 
sector-specific  information about GHG  emissions  and  the  associated 
additional costs needed to achieve the goals defined in different alternative scenarios.  
  26      
 
Further  details  on  modeling,  including  all  assumptions  for  the  design  of  sectoral  and 
economy-wide emission pathways, are provided in Annex 6. 
Each  economic  sector  has  different  emission  reduction  potential,  depending  on  the 
availability and associated costs of low and zero and net negative emission technologies. 
Given the differences in the structural and technological development of each sector, it is 
virtually impossible to achieve absolute zero emissions in all sectors. Therefore, a system-
wide, integrated, and cross-sectoral approach has been used in the design of emission routes. 
The modeling not only estimated the costs needed to reach the climate neutrality target by 
2050 but also explored the macroeconomic impacts of decarbonization pathways, including 
the effects on GDP growth, employment, and government revenues. In addition, the analysis 
considered important benefits of emission reductions, such as resource and material savings, 
reduction  of  negative  transport  externalities,  positive  health  effects,  and  increased 
productivity. 
Three scenarios for GHG emissions up to 2050 have been developed: 
a)  BAU: The emission trajectory of the scenario follows current trends. The scenario does 
not include energy efficiency, renewable energy, or GHG emission reduction targets for 
2030 and 2050, respectively, and therefore does not include the targets set in the NECP 
and the new NES. Current trends have been considered in all sectors, without further 
efforts to reduce emissions. 
b)  LA climate neutrality scenario: This scenario aims to achieve net climate neutrality by 
2050 by reducing emissions in the energy sector at a slower pace by 2045 and then with 
an increased effort until 2050. This allows the lower cost levels of low and zero emission 
technologies to be exploited. The scenario assumes that, in line with the targets set in the 
climate act, final energy consumption could reach a maximum of 785 PJ in 2030, with the 
share of renewable energy increasing to at least 21%. After 2030, non-waste sectors will 
be on the lowest cost trajectory toward climate neutrality, which will result in accelerated 
emission reductions by the end of the period, due to the postponement of investments 
pending on a decrease in technology costs. In the case of waste management, the model 
assumes a higher level of ambition by 2030 to meet the EU targets for reducing landfill 
use (circular economy). 
c)  EA climate neutrality scenario: the EA approach envisages achieving climate neutrality 
by 2050, while considering the short- and medium-term benefits of job creation and the 
reduction  of  environmental  externalities,  the  economic  potential  of  the  first  mover, 
improved productivity, and higher GDP growth. The scenario assumes that Hungary's 
final energy consumption in 2030 will be a maximum of 734 PJ, and that renewable 
energy  penetration  will  reach  27%.  The  emission  reduction  trajectories  for  industry, 
LULUCF,  waste  management,  and  agriculture  are  the  same  as  in  the  LA  scenario. 
Between 2030 and 2050, emissions will follow a linear trajectory to reach net zero 
emissions.  In  both  the  LA  and  EA  scenarios,  CCUS  technologies  will  become 
commercially viable in the energy and industrial sectors after 2030. 
For all three scenarios, the same demographic trends were identified, while GDP values were 
estimated endogenously by the GEM model. 
The projection of GHG emissions under the three scenarios examined is illustrated in Figure 
9.

the three scenarios examined (CO eq/year) 
2
The cost-benefit analysis of the scenarios up to 2050 found that the EA scenario clearly has 
several economic and employment opportunities, which need to be exploited in the context 
of the economic stimulus following the COVID-19 crisis: 
  The  additional  investments  required  compared  to  the  BAU  scenario  amount  to 
approximately HUF 24.7 billion in this scenario. These investments will be needed 
mainly to build clean energy production capacities, close end-of-life power plants and 
industrial  facilities,  renovate  existing  buildings  and  build  new  energy-efficient 
buildings, and develop  electric transport infrastructure. The transformation of the 
waste  management  system,  the  acceleration  of  the  introduction  of  the  circular 
economy, and the introduction of new sustainable agricultural practices will also 
require significant investments. 
  At the same time, the early implementation of investments will result in higher GDP 
and  government  revenue  and  avoided  costs  by  2050  and  a  greater  degree  of 
avoiding  negative  environmental  externalities  than  in  the  case  of  a  later 
implementation of these investments. 
  An important aspect is that the early implementation of investments can serve as 
an incentive for recovery during the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic by creating thousands of new and green jobs and increasing the well-
being of the Hungarian people. 
  Although the costs of financing and capital are currently low, channeling public and 
private resources toward green investment is more important than ever since tackling 
climate change is an urgent task. 
  In  addition,  accelerating  the  green  transformation  will  allow  Hungary  to  reduce 
material costs (including fuel costs) and imports, thus improving the trade balance and 
freeing up resources for other important purposes as well as increasing security of 
supply. 
  28      
 
Subchapter 4.3 and  Table 11 detail  green employment opportunities and socioeconomic 
benefits of the EA and LA scenarios. 
As a result of the modeling, the following conclusions can be drawn: 
  By 2050, the net zero emission target will be achieved using existing and developing 
technologies that are not yet or are only partially marketable. It is estimated that CCUS 
and hydrogen technologies will gradually gain ground after 2030; 
  Each sector must contribute to the goal of climate neutrality, depending on its own 
reduction potential, associated costs, and technological readiness; and 
  Increasing the domestic GHG absorption potential is essential for achieving the country's 
climate neutrality goal. 
The emission reduction trajectories of the two climate-neutral scenarios will start to 
diverge from the mid-2020s; by 2030, the difference will exceed 800,000 tons of CO eq. 
2
The larger reduction is the result of the EA scenario. In the case of early action, this requires 
greater efforts, which can be explained by the fact that increasing investments has a positive 
effect on the country's GDP. This in turn boosts demand from end-user segments, such as 
demand for travel or household appliances, thus increasing energy consumption. By 2030, 
GHG emissions will decrease significantly in both scenarios, by 54.4% (EA scenario) and 
53.5% (LA scenario), based on a baseline of 91.33 million tons of CO eq. 
2
For both the LA and EA scenarios, three constraints have been applied for 2030: a GHG, 
energy efficiency, and renewable energy constraint. For both scenarios, the most significant 
constraint is the scale of expansion of the renewable energy use: at least 21% penetration 
should be achieved under the LA scenario and at least 27% penetration is expected under the 
EA scenario. This difference results in a significantly higher use of renewable energy in the 
EA scenario, leading to lower GHG emissions. Based on the modeling results, the EA 
scenario has a renewable electricity production that is 1 terawatt-hour higher than in the LA 
scenario. This does not replace internal fossil fuel production but lowers the import ratio, so 
its GHG balance can be considered “neutral” for Hungary. 
From 2030 to 2045, the two emission trajectories sharply diverge, as the EA scenario 
follows a gradual and steady emission reduction trajectory, while the LA scenario sets a 
slower rate of reduction. After 2045, according to the LA scenario, a sharp decrease in 
emissions  can  be  observed,  reaching  climate  neutrality  by  2050.  The  EA  scenario  will 
integrate  earlier  CCUS  technologies  and  hydrogen  use  into  the  power  generation  and 
industrial sectors while accelerating the electrification of the economy and transport. Fossil 
fuels are being phased out of the electricity mix, resulting in a steep reduction in emissions 
from the energy and transport sectors.

The following trends and changes need to be facilitated in all sectors of the economy while 
exploiting the benefits of green economic development and employment:  
  Promotion of energy efficiency through information and awareness-raising campaigns. 
  Acceleration and expansion of energy efficiency investments11, particularly through the 
energy  efficiency  obligation  scheme—especially  in  the  residential  and  commercial 
sectors. 
  Significant  investments  will  be  needed  to  electrify  the  economy,  especially  in  the 
transport,  residential,  and  commercial  sectors.  One  of  the  main  conditions  for  the 
electrification of the economy is the modernization and climate-friendly transformation of 
the energy sector. 
  Further investment will be needed in the development of CCUS technology, increasing 
the utilization of renewable energy and energy storage systems. Given carbon phase-
out efforts, new investments in fossil fuel-based technologies and industries run the risk 
of rapidly depreciating assets. 
  In addition to the electrification of the transport sector, the expansion of the use of 
second-generation (or advanced) biofuels and carbon-free (or low-carbon in the transition 
period) hydrogen, the phasing out of LPG by the end of the period, and fuel efficiency 
will contribute to the decarbonization and modernization of the sector. 
  In the agricultural sector, investments will be needed mainly to reduce fertilizer use; to 
increase the use of precision farming, automation, and digitization; to manage organic 
manure more efficiently; and to increase feed, irrigation, and energy efficiency. 
  Significant  investments  will  be  needed  in  the  waste  sector  to  drastically  reduce 
landfilling. About 90% of the sector's emission reductions come from reducing landfills, 
                                                 
11 In the energy efficiency obligation system, the implementation of energy efficiency targets is achieved by 
involving the market, by shared burdening the companies selling electricity, gas and fuel, as a result of which 
the public repays the renovation costs not in one amount, but for several years. 
  30      
 
diverting waste streams, and improving treatment methods. Further investments will be 
needed to reduce the amount of industrial waste, improve municipal waste management, 
and prevent waste generation. Given the nature of waste management activities, reducing 
the sector's emissions will also require investments in other sectors (e.g., in the transport 
sector due to waste collection). 
  In the IPPU sector, the development of production/manufacturing processes, greater 
material efficiency, the introduction of a circular economy, alternative raw materials, and 
new and efficient tools are needed to nearly eliminate emissions. 
  There is  also a strong need for investment in  the  LULUCF sector to maintain and 
increase post-2030 CO  sequestration; in particular, measures to improve the adaptive 
2
capacity of forests, reduce logging in the medium term, and increase afforestation in the 
long term. In line with the requirements of sustainable forest management, emphasis 
should be placed on maintaining stock structures and management models with the best 
possible CO  balance (in terms of spatial and age structure), and active interventions 
2
should help forest stocks to survive, preserve, and develop their natural level despite the 
effects of climate change. 
  Research, development, and innovation will be a priority to achieving the energy and 
climate goals. Through the continued development of new technologies and processes, as 
well as their market introduction, a degree of cost reduction can be achieved to greatly 
help the spread of clean technologies. 
  The education and training of professionals capable of developing and/or applying new 
technologies and processes is also key.

Figure 11 – Additional investment needs by sector in the LA and EA scenarios compared to 
the BAU scenario 
In  the  case  of  the  EA  scenario,  the  costs  increase  to  approximately  HUF  24.7  billion 
compared to the BAU scenario. The annual additional investment requirement is about 4.8% 
of GDP in the EA scenario. 
According to the projections, the complete decarbonization of the Hungarian economy will 
also  generate  significant  avoided  costs  and  economic  and  social  benefits.  Significant 
material savings can be achieved from less energy and fertilizer use, resulting in a reduction 
in material costs of approximately HUF 2.4 billion. Investments and avoided costs lead to 
economic growth and job creation, which exceeds the economic growth and job creation 
potential of the BAU and LA scenarios. 
The early investments defined in the EA scenario, as well as the gradual and steady 
reduction in emissions, are projected to result in 20.7% higher GDP by 2050 compared 
to the BAU scenario. Between 2020 and 2050, the average annual GDP growth will be 0.56% 
higher than in the BAU scenario. These projections are in line with EU simulations, which 
have estimated impacts between -0.4% and + 0.5% of GDP/year to reach the 55% emission 
reduction target by 2030. 
According to the EA scenario, the cumulated surplus GDP amounts to approximately HUF 
19.8 billion, and the government revenues are forecasted to increase by about HUF 11.1 
billion cumulatively between 2020 and 2050 (Hiba! A hivatkozási forrás nem található.).

https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/Stats_Brief_Apr2015_Issue_07_Average-growth-rate.pdf) 
  33      
 
According to the system dynamics model calculations, the decarbonization of the national 
economy creates new jobs in the analyzed sectors. The macroeconomic effects of investing in 
the green transition will spill over, leading to higher GDP and more green jobs compared to 
the BAU scenario. The EA scenario estimates that investments in the decarbonization of the 
energy  sector,  energy  efficiency  measures,  waste  management,  bus  transport,  and 
reforestation could create nearly 183,000 new jobs by 2050 compared to the BAU scenario. 
Job creation resulting from the greening of sectors significantly offsets the loss of jobs in the 
waste management and fossil fuel-based industries. Through appropriate retraining programs 
and the efficient use of the EU’s Just Transition Fund resources, the Hungarian economy can 
benefit from the green transition. 
The role of energy saving is outstanding  
The largest potential for energy savings is in the residential sector, due to the cost-effective 
renovations to be carried out mainly under the energy efficiency obligation scheme as well as 
the  favorable  energy  consumption  indicators  of  newly  built  dwellings.  Primary  energy 
demand is further reduced by better energy efficiency in modern household appliances. 
In addition to the residential sector, a higher rate of energy savings can be achieved in the 
industry sector; however, the results of the two climate-neutral scenarios (mainly in the case 
of the EA scenario) show an increasing trend in energy consumption compared to the BAU 
scenario. This is because higher investment activity has a positive effect on GDP growth, 
strengthening the performance of industrial sectors as well. For this reason, higher final 
energy consumption (540 PJ) is expected in the EA scenario for the 2050 target date than in 
the  LA  scenario  (485  PJ).  The  impact  of  higher  GDP  on  final  energy  consumption  is 
particularly pronounced when we consider the more ambitious 2030 energy savings target in 
the EA scenario. This is also the reason why there is no major difference in the final energy 
consumption values in 2040 between the two scenarios. 
In the case of the transport sector, the EA scenario also shows a smaller increase in energy 
consumption compared to the values seen in the LA scenario by 2050, which can also be 
explained  by  faster  GDP  growth.  In  the  intervening  years,  however,  lower  energy 
consumption is expected in the EA scenario, as it is most cost-effective to reduce energy 
consumption in the transport sector in addition to buildings, and this is not offset by the GDP 
effect. Due to the large-scale fuel shift and modal shift, by 2050 the energy consumption of 
the sector will only slightly exceed the 2016 level. 
Renewable energy-based energy use and the rise of carbon-free hydrogen play a key role in 
the decarbonization of transport; technologies using these energy sources are more efficient 
than those currently used in internal combustion engines. Prioritizing public transport over 
private transport will further reduce the primary energy demand of the transport sector. In 
contrast  to  the  smaller  increase  in  energy  consumption  in  the  EA  scenario,  in  the  LA 
scenario, due to the lower GDP impact, the 2050 value will result in 90% of the 2016 value. 
 
The share of renewable energy will expand significantly  
The high share of renewable energy in 2050, which is close to 90%, is explained by the 
combined effect of several factors. The use of renewable energy is greatly increased by the 
production of hydrogen based on electricity from electrolysis technology and increasingly 
from renewable sources, which reduces the use of natural gas. In addition, due to the high 
degree  of  electrification,  which  occurs  in  all  areas  of  the  energy  sector—including  the 
building, transport, and industrial sectors—more than 10 gigawatts (GW) of renewable power 
  34      
 
plant  capacity  are  needed,  which  requires  a  similar  amount  of  energy  storage  (battery) 
capacity for smooth operation. 
Moreover, the high uptake of biomass-based electricity generation with CCUS technology 
will further increase the share of renewable energy. In addition to climate-friendly (carbon-
free) electricity generation, the use of this technology is also needed because it has the only 
additional removal capacity. While based on the current methodology, biomass accounts for 
zero CO  emissions, with CCUS technology, we can expect negative emissions. 
2
An increase in the use of renewable energy will greatly contribute to a large decrease in 
energy imports, thus contributing to an increase in energy security. This affects all areas of 
the energy sector: the electricity sector, oil consumption, and the reduction of natural gas 
import demand through the reduction of natural gas consumption. Most renewables will come 
from solar power, biomass, and biofuels. 
4.1.3. Indicative milestones 
To reach the 2050 net zero GHG emissions target, indicative milestones can be set for the EA 
and LA scenarios, based on the modeling results, showing the stages to be reached by 2030 
and 2040. These milestones also  provide an  indication of the extent to which net  zero 
emissions in 2050 are energy efficiency indicators and the proportion of renewable energy 
that  can  be  achieved  in  an  optimal,  cost-effective  way  relative  to  gross  final  energy 
consumption. 
As shown in Figure 9, there is an accelerating net GHG emission reduction trajectory for the 
LA scenario, in which case the 35.9% GHG emission reduction in 2018 will increase to 54% 
by 2030 and 64% by 2040. In contrast, in the EA scenario, a more balanced, linear GHG 
emission reduction trajectory has been identified, in which case the rate of reduction in 2040 
will already reach net 73%. 
In  the  case  of  the  EA  scenario,  the  share  of  renewable  energy  in  gross  final  energy 
consumption also shows a more balanced increase. The renewable rate of 13.3% in 2017 will 
double by 2030 and then remain at the 2040 level (25.1%). In contrast, in the LA scenario for 
2017 and 2030, growth is less than 8 percentage points. 
Compared to the final energy consumption of 775 PJ in 2017, there is an indicative energy 
efficiency target of 5.3% by 2030, almost 15% by 2040, and more than 30% by 2050 for the 
EA scenario. In contrast, in the LA scenario, there will be an increase of 1.2% by 2030, then 
14.5% by 2040, and 37.4% of energy saving demand by 2050 to achieve climate neutrality. 
 
4.2. Sector-specific pathways, policies, and measures 
The cost-benefit analysis of the scenarios up to 2050 (Subsection 4.3) reveals that the BAU 
scenario does not meet the increased 2030 GHG emission reduction target or the 2050 
climate neutrality target set in Act no. XLIV of 2020 on Climate Protection. Based on the 
cost-benefit analysis performed, the net benefit of the EA scenario exceeds the LA scenario; 
therefore, this subsection focuses only on the comparison of the BAU and EA scenarios.

Table 4 – SWOT analysis of the Energy Sector 
Developments and main trends in past emissions 
In Hungary, as in the world in general, the energy sector is the largest GHG-emitting 
sector. In 2018, the sector's GHG emissions exceeded 45.5 million tons of CO eq, which is 
2
72% of the total Hungarian GHG emissions (Hiba! A hivatkozási forrás nem található.). 
Of  these  emissions,  28.8%  came  from  electricity  and  district  heating,  30.6%  from 
transport, and 11.7% from industrial energy consumption. Within the energy sector, a 
significant share of the emissions can be attributed to the energy consumption in buildings 
and the agricultural sector (27.1%), while the remainder are fugitive emissions (1.8%). 
Emissions related to energy consumption in the residential, service, and agricultural 
sectors have decreased significantly since the regime change in 1990, partly due to energy 
efficiency gains and the use of fossil fuels with lower GHG intensity. While households and 
the tertiary sector were associated with significant coal and oil consumption in the early 
1990s, the use of these fuels declined substantially after the democratic transition. In the case 
of the retail and tertiary sector in general, GHG emissions fell steadily between 1990 and 
2007; from 2007 onward, they came to a near stagnant trajectory.  
The  difference  between  individual  years  was  mainly  caused  by  the  fluctuating  energy 
demand of heating. During this period, the GHG intensity did not change significantly, 
stabilizing at 37–39 kg/MJ.

In contrast to other sectors, GHG emissions from electricity and district heating (Hiba! A 
hivatkozási forrás nem található.) started to increase in the years following the regime 
change and peaked in the late 1990s. Subsequently, with the decline in fossil electricity 
production (mainly based on coal and lignite), emissions started to decrease significantly 
until the early 2010s. In the last five to six years, GHG emissions from electricity and district 
heating production have stagnated between 12–14 million tons of CO eq/year, of which about 
2
5–6 million tons come from the country's last lignite-based power plant, the Mátra Power 
Plant.

from the other energy industries, 1990–2018 
  37      
 
In the years following the 1990 regime change, in parallel with the decline of industrial 
facilities, especially heavy industry, the energy consumption of the industrial sector also 
decreased, and as a result, the GHG emissions related to energy consumption of industry 
declined as well (Hiba! A hivatkozási forrás nem található.). While GHG emissions from 
industrial energy use were around 14 million tons at the time of the regime change, they have 
fallen below 10 million tons of CO eq/year in a few years. The decrease in GHG intensity 
2
can  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  the  industrial  subsegments  for  the  productions  that 
decreased  significantly  used  mainly  coal  and  crude  oil.  The  decline  in  GHG  emissions 
continued until  the early  2000s, and then the economic crisis  of 2008-2009 resulted in 
another decline. Overall, however, the emissions have increased over the last few years, with 
GHG emissions from energy use in the industrial sector increasing by 80% in the last six 
years, explained by the rapid expansion of industrial production.

energy consumption, 1990–2018 
In Hungary, the transport sector is responsible for 20% of all GHG emissions (Hiba! A 
hivatkozási forrás nem található.). According to Eurostat data, in 2018, GHG emissions 
from transport were 13.9 million tons of CO eq/year, of which 92.8% were road, 5.1% 
2
aviation, 1.1% rail, 0.1% water transport, and 1% related to other transport. 
Transport emissions have increased by 31.4% since 2013, and without significant policy 
intervention, further growth is expected soon. As such, reducing GHG emissions from this 
sector in Hungary will be one of the biggest challenges in the short term. The cause of this 
expansion is due to the higher level of motorization in connection with increases in income, 
economic development of the Central and Eastern European regions, and growth in road 
freight transport, especially transit traffic through Hungary. 
Considering domestic emissions, it is necessary to pay attention to road and rail transport in 
long-term planning, which together accounted for 88% of passenger transport performance 
and 84.3% of freight transport performance in Hungary in 2017. In addition, aviation must be 
considered because foot traffic at the Budapest Liszt Ferenc International Airport increased 
from 8.5 to 14.9 million people between 2013 and 2018.

Past trends of final energy consumption  
Final energy consumption has remained relatively stable over the last three decades, with 
smaller changes than in the case of GHG emissions (Hiba! A hivatkozási forrás nem 
található.). 
 
Source: Eurostat 
Figure 18 – Composition of final energy consumption and the change in primary energy 
consumption, 1990–2018 (PJ) 
The final energy consumption fell from 800 PJ in 1990 to 650 PJ in a few years, due to the 
collapse of the industry. It remained at this level until the early 2000s, then increased due to 
strong growth in the transport sector, peaking at around 760 PJ in 2005. As a result of energy 
efficiency investments and energy savings in the household and service sectors, final energy 
consumption decreased to 660 PJ by 2014. The recent years are marked by new growth due 
  39      
 
to increased energy consumption in the industrial and transport sectors. The primary energy 
consumption has followed a similar trajectory as final energy use in recent decades. 
Actions needed in the energy sector to achieve net zero GHG emissions at the national level 
In order to meet the 2050 net zero GHG emissions at the national level, emissions from the 
energy sector must be reduced to at least 2 million tons. This requires improving energy 
efficiency  and  increasing  electrification,  as  well  as  using  CCUS  technology,  hydrogen 
technologies, and modern bioenergy technologies. 
These requirements entail a marked transformation of the fuel composition of the energy 
sector. The significant reduction and phasing out of the role of natural gas in certain sectors 
(e.g., households) will be decisive. Due to the high degree of electrification, significant 
interventions will be required on the electricity generation side as well. There is a need for a 
large-scale deployment of clean, renewable technology with a capacity of more than 10 GW 
to meet the significant increased demand for electricity by mid-century. As intraday, variable 
(weather-dependent) renewable electricity generation and daily peak consumption do not 
match, significant electricity storage (primarily battery technology) capacities will need to be 
built. Consultations with industry experts have confirmed that energy storage flexibility is a 
key requirement for the twenty-first-century electricity system. 
The annual change in renewable energy production is not in line with the annual consumption 
profile. For this reason, it is equally important to promote the use of technologies that can 
store  large  amounts  of  energy  for  a  longer  period  (especially  power-to-gas  (P2G) 
technologies) in Hungary. 
 
One of the cornerstones of decarbonization is hydrogen  
The HU-TIMES model distinguishes between different types of hydrogen production: 
  Grey hydrogen: it is produced from natural gas, so it has a significant GHG emission impact.  
  Blue hydrogen: it is produced from natural gas, but it is also associated with CCUS technology. 
Although this production method has a significantly better GHG balance than grey hydrogen, as CCUS 
is not 100% efficient, i.e., it is not able to capture the total CO2 emissions, it is considered a net pollutant 
in terms of GHG emissions. 
  Carbon-free or low-carbon hydrogen: produced in a carbon-neutral way or from low-carbon electricity  
Currently, hydrogen is transported in a compressed gas or liquid state. For large quantities, pipeline transport 
may be the ideal, for smaller quantities, road, rail and water transport seem to be a better alternative. 
Hydrogen can be transported by pipeline in two ways. On the one hand, through a dedicated hydrogen 
network, the construction of which involves significant investment costs, and by being integrated into the 
natural gas network. In the latter case, further studies are needed to determine the maximum level of safe 
incorporation, the technical possibilities and the related development needs. 
Dedicated hydrogen networks should be built primarily in the direction of large industrial facilities (or even 
hydrogen production can take place there), while blending should be used in a segment where building a 
hydrogen  network  would  be  very  costly  (e.g.  residential  or  other  geographically  dispersed  energy 
consumers).  
 
Change in GHG emissions 
Achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions at the national level is possible if emissions 
from the energy sector fall to at least 2 million tons of CO eq from the current value of 40 
2
  40      
 
million  tons;  that  is,  a  96%  reduction  is  needed  (Hiba!  A  hivatkozási  forrás  nem 
található.). 
CCUS  technology  is  essential  to  achieve  the  goals.  With  the  current  knowledge  and 
technologies, it would not be possible to reduce GHG emissions in the energy sector to the 
required level without carbon sequestration. In many subsectors—industry, transport, and 
others (such as carbon leakage and agricultural energy use)—full decarbonization cannot be 
achieved without CCUS. The CCUS technologies typically only enter the energy system in 
the 2030s, and possibly the 2040s, as there are usually cheaper solutions to tackle GHG 
emissions. 
Under the BAU scenario, GHG emissions will decrease slightly for the energy sector but will 
still emit almost 30 million tons of CO eq in 2050, a reduction of only about 57% compared 
2
to the base year 1990. The largest decrease is in the energy sector, and bioenergy with CCUS 
also appears in the BAU scenario, due to the high CO  quota price.

Changes in final energy consumption by sector  
The household subsector clearly has the greatest potential for energy savings (Hiba! A 
hivatkozási forrás nem található.). Even in the case of the BAU scenario, the energy 
consumption of households decreases significantly, due to the substantially lower energy 
consumption  of  new  appliances,  newly  built  dwellings,  and  renovations  implemented 
primarily under the energy efficiency obligation scheme. These will result in a decrease of 
energy consumption from 260 PJ to below 160 PJ by 2050, even under the BAU scenario. 
The  decrease  is  even  more  significant  in  the  EA  scenario,  where  by  2050  the  energy 
consumption of households will drop to 70 PJ, which is only 26% of the consumption of the 
base year. 
The  energy  consumption  of  the  industrial  sector  develops  differently  between  the 
examined scenarios. In the BAU scenario, GDP growth is accompanied by an increase in 
energy consumption at the beginning, followed by energy efficiency investments, and a 
steadily declining trend from 2030 onward. In the EA scenario, the trend is identical until 
2030; thereafter, energy consumption will decrease less than in the BAU scenario. This is not 
due to a lack of energy efficiency investments, but because the EA scenario will lead to faster 
  41      
 
GDP growth, which in turn will be accompanied by an increase in industrial production and 
thus energy consumption. Faster economic growth is due to the significantly higher level of 
investment activity in the national economy in the climate-neutral scenario. 
The service and transport sectors follow similar trajectories in the two scenarios. If no 
climate targets are set, energy consumption in both sectors will increase slightly, while in the 
EA scenario it will decrease by 10–20% compared to current levels, due to energy efficiency 
investments and more efficient fuel composition.

Figure 20 – Composition of final energy consumption by sector in each scenario, 2016–2050 
(PJ) 
Fuel composition of final energy consumption – hydrogen partly replaces natural gas; high 
degree of electrification 
The composition of final energy consumption needs to change significantly to reach the 
climate neutrality target by 2050 (Figure 21). 
There is no significant shift in the BAU scenario, and even the share of natural gas is 
increasing, displacing mainly renewable energy sources. The biggest change in the EA 
scenario is due to large-scale electrification, which affects the entire spectrum of the 
energy sector. By 2050, electricity consumption will account for more than half of total 
energy consumption. The high degree of electrification is accompanied by a drastic increase 
in electricity production. As a result of electrification in transport, oil consumption will fall 
dramatically by 2050 to a quarter of the current use. 
The other significant change, which will start in the 2040s, is the decline in natural gas 
consumption and the complete disappearance thereof in some sectors. Natural gas is partly 
replaced by hydrogen, mainly in the transport and industrial sectors. Hydrogen plays an 
important role, providing 10–15% of final energy consumption, partly through blending into 
the natural gas grid. The maximum blending rate in 2050 is 50%. This is a theoretical average 
value, which shows that half of the domestic “gas consumption” (theoretical mixture of 
hydrogen and natural gas) will consist of half natural gas and half hydrogen. There will be 
dedicated hydrogen pipelines that will supply 100% pure hydrogen as well as sectors and 
activities where pure hydrogen will be needed (e.g., transport, industrial raw materials). The 
50% of hydrogen will not be fed into the natural gas network. 
  42      
 
At first glance, it may seem surprising that the use of renewable energy sources in both 
scenarios will fall to a third/quarter of the current level by mid-century. This can be explained 
by the fact that the limited use of biomass is utilized in electricity generation, where the 
greatest GHG savings can be achieved with the help of biomass power plants equipped with 
CCUS technology. 
 
Source: Eurostat, own modeling result 
Figure 21 – Final energy consumption fuel composition in each scenario, 2016–2050 (PJ) 
Fuel composition of primary energy use—strong renewable penetration by 2050  
There will be an increase in primary energy consumption until 2030, in both the BAU and the 
EA scenarios, since the new Paks nuclear power plant units will be commissioned, and even 
the old units will run in parallel during this period. However, even then, the two scenarios 
begin to separate; differences can be found in the use of natural gas and in the case of 
renewables. For the BAU scenario, the rate of primary energy consumption will be at the 
current level by 2050, while under the EA scenario it will fall below 900 PJ. In the latter 
scenario, a strong renewable dominance in the primary energy mix can already be 
observed in 2050, resulting from the high use of solar energy as well as biomass and biofuels 
(Hiba! A hivatkozási forrás nem található.).

The social cost of the sectoral goals—HUF 637 billion per year is required  
The HU-TIMES model provides an opportunity to quantify the additional costs of achieving 
the goals in the energy sector (Figure 23). These costs are not entirely borne by public 
finances; the way in which the burden is shared between the state and private actors depends 
on the regulation of the given subsector. 
The analyses distinguish three main cost categories: investment cost (capital expenditures - 
CAPEX), operating cost (OPEX), and EU ETS quota costs and subsidies. The latter include 
the amount of support for renewables and the cost of CO  quotas for companies covered by 
2
the EU ETS. It is important to emphasize that the HU-TIMES model only quantifies the costs 
in the energy sector; the benefits—for example, avoiding the costs of air pollution or the 
impact on GDP—are simulated by the GEM model. 
The largest change can be observed in investment costs. In the case of the EA scenario, there 
is an additional investment need of HUF 650 billion per year compared to the BAU scenario, 
which is offset by the lower operating costs and the lower amount of quota costs/subsidies. 
The net value of benefits and costs represents an additional cost of HUF 637 billion 
annually to achieve the goals of the sector. 
 
Source: HU-TIMES modeling result  
Figure 23 – Distribution of annualized additional costs by category compared to the BAU 
scenario, HUF billion/year 
Additional  investment  costs  are  mostly  concentrated  in  the  transport  sector  and 
households, respectively (Figure 24). In the EA scenario, the additional investment cost 
required in the transport sector is HUF 256 billion per year (40% of the total additional 
investment); in the residential sector, it is HUF 210 billion annually (33%). The electricity 
  44      
 
and district heating sectors account for 15% of investments, while the service sector accounts 
for 12%. 
There is no significant additional investment cost for the industrial segment. This is because 
investments that are made in the EA scenario are also taking place in the BAU scenario. At 
the same time, in the case of the industrial sector, a change of fuel is indicated by the 
projections of the climate-neutral scenario, which can also be seen in the change of operating 
cost. In order to meet 2050 targets in the energy sector, it is necessary to switch to more 
expensive, cleaner fuels (e.g., carbon-free hydrogen or electricity). 
As a result of additional investments, however, operating costs will decrease in the household 
segment, transport, and the service sector. This is due to factors such as an increasing number 
of vehicles with lower fuel consumption or energy efficiency investments (e.g., insulation, 
window replacement, more efficient heating). 
 
Source: HU-TIMES modeling result  
Figure 24 – Distribution of annualized additional costs of LA and EA scenarios compared to 
the BAU scenario, HUF billion/year 
In the cost analysis, the impact of allowance prices for the EA scenario was analyzed using a 
sensitivity  analysis,  assuming  that  the  price  of  CO   allowances  would  be  doubled 
2
between 2030 and 2050. As a result, the cost of achieving the decarbonization target will 
increase by about 1.5%, by HUF 10 billion annually. At the same time, higher quota prices 
have an incentive to achieve the targets by making pollution a more serious cost factor for 
companies. 
The HU-TIMES model also provides an opportunity to show investment costs in more detail, 
especially in the transport, electricity, and district heating sectors. 
In the electricity and district heating sector, the differences in investment costs between the 
EA and BAU scenarios are shown in Hiba! A hivatkozási forrás nem található.. Costs 
show discounted, cumulative values for 2016. In total, by 2050, an additional investment of 
  45      
 
about HUF 3 600 billion is needed to achieve the net zero emission goals. The additional 
 
costs will be evenly distributed until 2045, after which additional investment costs will be 
higher.

costs of the EA and BAU scenarios in the transport sector, HUF billion/year 
The total net additional cost amounts to HUF 10 000 billion; however, there are investments 
that are implemented only in the BAU scenario, while others appear only in the EA scenario. 
  46      
 
In the latter case, the largest item (compared to the BAU scenario) is electric cars, but the 
additional investment costs of vehicles using railway electricity and trucks using electricity 
are also significant. However, in the case of the EA scenario, there are cost elements that are 
absent, as opposed to the BAU scenario. Less should be spent on LPG-powered cars, on 
compressed natural gas (CNG)-powered trucks and on diesel-powered railway cars in the EA 
scenario, compared to the BAU scenario. The incurrence of additional investment costs over 
the whole period is almost linear for the transport sector. 
Decarbonization  of  households  requires  a  reduction  in  natural  gas  and  the  spread  of 
alternative solutions (especially heat pumps)  
Household  energy  consumption  (Hiba!  A  hivatkozási  forrás  nem  található.)  is  also 
declining in the BAU scenario. This is mainly due to the low energy consumption of newly 
built buildings. In many cases, the renovation of buildings is a profitable investment; that is, 
the post-renovation utility savings can compensate for the renovation costs. In terms of fuel 
composition, firewood use will constantly decline from an initial level of 74 PJ to a few PJ by 
2050. This is because households are switching to more efficient and, in the long run, more 
economical fuel, especially natural gas. In the case of natural gas consumption, a slight 
increase can thus be observed. Electricity consumption is declining due to the expected 
replacement of household appliances, as new appliances operate at significantly lower energy 
intensities.  
The EA scenario already shows other trends in 2030. Due to stronger energy efficiency 
investments, the energy consumption of this sector will be almost 50 PJ lower in 2030 
than in the BAU scenario. Energy efficiency investments will continue beyond the 2030s. 
At the same time, there is a constant shift in fuel: natural gas is decreasing and will be pushed 
back  to  a  minimum  level  by  2050  according  to  the  EA  scenario.  Meanwhile,  coal  is 
disappearing  from  the  energy  mix14,  contributing  to  making  net  zero  GHG  emissions 
available  at  the  national  level  as  well.15  In  this  regard,  a  large-scale  infrastructure 
development  is  imminent.  For  example,  the  solar  panel  program  will  be  part  of  the 
transformation. There are also pilot projects targeting municipalities where natural gas is 
currently  not  introduced.16  The  experience  gained  during  these  projects  will  also  be an 
important and key element of the transition. 
As biomass (i.e., firewood) is only available to a limited extent, the use of this type of fuel is 
reduced to a minimum. In the EA scenario in 2040, hydrogen will appear as energy blended 
into the natural gas grid, but this is more of a temporary solution as electricity will remain the 
only widely available, zero emission fuel in the long run. 
Consultations with stakeholders have also confirmed that one of the most cost-effective ways 
to  achieve  the  long-term  decarbonization  target  is  to  increase  energy  efficiency  in  the 
household and service sectors and to use renewable electricity, which requires the promotion 
of decentralized—prosumer—networks. 
                                                 
14 The elimination of coal combustion is also important from the point of view of air pollution. Restrictions on 
the use of certain solid fuels by the population and making the social fuel support system more environmentally 
friendly are listed among the measures to be taken in the National Air Pollution Reduction Program. 
15 Further details on the measures planned in connection with the utilization of gas pipelines in Hungary can be 
found in Hungary's National Energy and Climate Plan adopted in January 2020. 
16 Within the framework of the energy innovation tender package announced in March 2020, the call “Ensuring 
the energy supply of settlements using alternative gas supply methods and using modern technologies and

The implementation of the EA scenario presupposes important changes. While energy

afterward. Although the energy savings are significantly lower than for households, it seems 
that  intervention  is  needed  to  reduce  energy  consumption  in  the  energy  sector.  Such  a 
regulatory  tool  could  be  the  energy  efficiency  obligation  scheme  to  be  introduced, 
  48      
 
investments,  or  operating  subsidies,  but  these  could  include  direct  (e.g.,  prohibitive) 
instruments as well. There is also a significant change in fuel composition: the consumption 
of  natural  gas  will  decrease  significantly,  accompanied  by  an  increasing  proportion  of 
hydrogen.  Moreover,  a  high  degree  of  electrification  will  be  achieved  by  2050,  when 
electricity will account for two thirds of the energy consumption of the entire service 
sector. 
In  addition  to  CCUS,  hydrogen  and  electrification  play  a  key  role  in  the  partial 
decarbonization of industry.  
The change in industrial energy consumption (Hiba! A hivatkozási forrás nem található.) is 
characterized by an upward trend in the beginning in both the BAU and EA scenarios, 
but energy consumption will start to decline from the 2030s due to the energy efficiency 
investments. In both scenarios, these investments are driven by the market, i.e., there is no 
need for government incentives. In the EA scenario, the rate of energy reduction is lower than 
in the BAU scenario. This is due to the fact that higher investments in the national economy 
increases GDP, which increases industrial demand, including energy consumption. 
While there is no significant change in the fuel structure in the BAU scenario, a substantial 
realignment can be predicted in the EA scenario. Hydrogen will appear from 2040 and will 
play an increasingly important role, accounting for 15% of total energy consumption by 
2050.  Hydrogen  primarily  replaces  natural  gas.  During  the  consultation  stream  called 
“Climate Breakfasts” held in 2020, the role of hydrogen was also highlighted by the private 
sector actors as an important factor in industrial decarbonization. 
The stakeholder consultation also confirmed the importance of digitization and electrification 
in the long-term process of industrial decarbonization. In addition, representatives from the 
private sector stressed the need to increase energy efficiency. They consider it particularly 
important to introduce incentives for research and development to ensure the competitiveness 
of domestic actors in the development, production and export of new, energy-efficient and 
renewable energy-based technologies.

Electrification, biofuels, and hydrogen are all needed for the partial decarbonization of the 
transport sector  
In  the  transport  sector  (Hiba!  A  hivatkozási  forrás  nem  található.),  energy  use  is 
increasing in both the BAU and EA scenarios, albeit to very different degrees. While energy 
consumption will increase by about 50 PJ in the BAU scenario between 2016 and 2050, this 
value will be only 8 PJ in the EA scenario. 
Diesel consumption will decrease the most by 2050: to 34 PJ in the BAU scenario, while in 
the EA scenario, this fuel will completely disappear by the end of the period. This requires 
regulatory intervention that either supports the spread of cleaner solutions (e.g., subsidizing 
electric cars) or penalizes (e.g., higher tax), possibly limiting fossil fuel technologies. 
Hungary is already taking significant steps to promote electromobility. Electromobility and 
electric propulsion are expected to become increasingly important in the future, so the 
market is expected to adapt more and more to new circumstances on its own and require 
fewer incentives. Already in the BAU scenario the electricity consumption in 2050 will be 37 
PJ, which could thus account for 17% of the total transport sector without further action. In 
the EA scenario, this value is already close to 60% (111 PJ). 
 
Electrification in road transport and its impact on the Hungarian automotive industry 
Electric vehicles are becoming more and more widespread in Hungary as well. In terms of the spread of 
battery-powered electric cars (electromobility in the narrower sense), Hungary is already one of the leading 
players in the region, and in the long run, hydrogen-powered cell electric propulsion17  will also have to be 
reckoned with. This process is also supported by the tightening of EU environmental standards for motor 
vehicles. 
In the short and medium term, we must reckon with the expansion of battery electric propulsion and its effects 
on the automotive industry. In addition to the emergence of new technologies, electromobility poses a 
challenge to the domestic supplier network, partly because it reduces and, on the other hand, transforms the 
need for parts, given that electric cars are made up of fewer and different types of parts. The production of 
electric powertrains will also change the number of employees and the necessary qualifications: fewer and 
partly new competencies will be needed in the sector. As a result, a transformation is expected in Hungary's 
automotive supply and service chain and workforce. 
How Hungary and the Hungarian automotive sector can and will remain competitive in this currently changing 
environment depends to a large extent on increasing Hungary's innovation capacity (including knowledge) and 
its willingness to restructure. “In Hungary, in recent years, investments in the automotive industry have been 
made in new and developing areas, such as the production of batteries and electric motors. The most likely 
scenario points to a reorganization within the industry, where the economic performance of the sector will not 
decline but its fundamentals will gradually change.” 18 
The use of hydrogen in transport is also essential to achieve the decarbonization goals. 
Hydrogen  will  appear  to  a  greater  extent  in  the  2040s,  and  by  2050  its  share  will  be 
significant (8%). The biofuel share will be twice as much, with the rise of second-generation 
biofuels, and the relegation of first-generation biofuels to the background. 
Consultations with industry representatives have also confirmed that decarbonization can be 
promoted in the automotive industry through fuel switching and the introduction of hydrogen, 
as well as a change of approach. In order to significantly reduce GHG emissions, it is

Figure 30 – Distribution of energy consumption in the transport sector in the BAU and EA 
scenarios 
There are also significant changes in the transport modes (Figure 30). While in the BAU 
scenario, the energy consumption of passenger cars will decrease only slightly, in the EA 
scenario it will be reduced by about two-thirds by 2050. Passenger transport is partly 
diverted to rail and bus, which have a significantly more favorable GHG balance per 
passenger-kilometer. Cycling and car sharing should also be further promoted. 
As far as bus traffic is concerned, a pilot project has been developed to replace the public 
transport bus fleet locally. The aim of the Green Bus Program19 is to replace the local public 
bus fleet by encouraging domestic bus production, to reduce the average age of operated 
buses, the emission values and maintenance and operating costs of bus transport, and to 
improve the quality of travel services. 
Regarding railways, the goal is that by 2040, all electric traction vehicles will be able to 
produce the most efficient traction known today, with significantly lower consumption during 
braking and fed back into the grid or own battery than most models running today. Non-
electrified line sections can be accessed by battery-powered vehicles, the acquisition of which 
is planned to be phased in from 2021 onwards. 
With the current level of cycling, a reduction of 15.25 million tons of CO2 emissions per year 
can  be  achieved  in  Europe.  This  reduction  in  emissions  occurs  precisely  in  the  most 
problematic,  densely  populated  urban  areas,  and  therefore  greatly  improves  the  health, 
quality of life and livability of cities living there. In addition to traditional cycling and the

necessary  infrastructure,  electric  bicycles  and  scooters  can  play  a  greater  role  in  urban 
transport and its decarbonization in the long term. 
  52      
 
Other areas affected by GHG emissions from transport  
The Paris Agreement does not cover aviation. Hungary discusses GHG emissions and environmental impacts 
from aviation  under the auspices of the EU and ICAO, and the issue can only be regulated on the 
international stage efficiently. 
Domestically, there are essentially only sport flights, small leisure flights, education and military flights, 
which are not as significant in terms of environmental impact as scheduled air traffic. Thus, the volume of 
domestic aviation in Hungary, as well as the resulting emissions are marginal, and their growth is not 
expected under current trends. 
In terms of the environmental impact of aviation, the reduction in the volume of emissions is expected in the 
long run from technological developments (e.g., new types of aircraft, alternative fuels), not from a reduction 
in the number of aircraft movements. 
On shorter travels, replacing aviation with other modes of transport may also be an option, e.g. high-speed 
rail, may result in emission reductions. This may require the development of multimodal transport and 
combined tickets. 
A significant part of passenger and freight water transport is made on river the Danube; the domestic fleet 
accounts for about 15% of the international freight traffic affecting Hungary. 
The  Tisza  River  also  has  significant  potential  for  inland  freight  transport,  which  can  be  considered 
environmentally friendly compared to road and air transport, but the successful diversion of goods requires 
the development of infrastructure. 
In 2018, there were 14 pusher craft, 70 self-propelled cargo ships, 133 passenger ships and about 24,000 
small craft in the Hungarian register (Central Statistical Office (KSH), 2018). 
With regard to water freight and passenger transport, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas 
(CNG) technology do not make a significant difference in terms of GHG emissions compared to diesel fuel. 
Hydrogen has a potential in shipping as well, but the transition to it is still hindered by a number of factors 
(the life cycle of main engines and hulls is longer in shipping, technology change is a significant investment, 
there is currently no fuel supply network, etc.). 
Electric boats have gained considerable ground in recreational boating in recent years, and one of the main 
drivers of development is the ban on the use of internal combustion engines on our great lakes; as a result, 
there are several competitive domestic companies in the market.

Renewable and nuclear-based electricity consumption and generation 
The energy sector as a whole is impacted by electrification, which is also the most 
important trend leading to decarbonization. In the case of the BAU scenario, electricity 
consumption does not really change: an increasing trend can be observed between 2016 and 
2030,  which  then  decreases,  mainly  due  to  industrial  and  residential  energy  efficiency 
investments. In contrast, a significant change can be seen in the EA scenario. From 2020 
onward, strong growth is witnessed, driven decisively by the electrification of transport. 
However, the biggest increase will be in the 2040s, when consumption will increase from 190 
PJ to 291 PJ, due to the electrification of transport and, with the spread of heat pumps, of the 
household sector. For the whole period, the growth rate is 2.2% (Hiba! A hivatkozási forrás 
nem található.). 
 
Source: Eurostat, own modeling 
Figure 32 – Composition of electricity consumption in the BAU and EA scenarios 
Such a significant increase in electricity consumption is accompanied by an increase in 
production  demand.  Achieving  the  2050  climate  neutrality  target  and  meeting 
consumption will require around 65 GW of clean generation capacity in addition to 
nuclear capacity. Of this, 51 GW is photovoltaic energy (Hiba! A hivatkozási forrás nem 
található.). 
The high degree of electrification accelerates in the 2040s. By then, support for the current 
modernization of residential heating systems will run out. 
It is also important to note that, in accordance with the principle of sustainable land use, 
brownfield sites should be given priority in connection with the installation of renewable 
energy production capacities (especially solar panels).

Figure 33 – Composition of installed electricity capacities in the BAU and EA scenarios 
With  the  build-up  of  new  renewable  energy  generation  capacities,  it  will  also  be 
necessary to build storage capacity from 2040 onward for the system to have sufficient 
flexible capacity. Electricity storage capacities in 2050 in the EA scenario will amount to tens 
of gigawatts of capacity. The opinion of industry experts also confirms the important role of 
battery energy storage technologies, hydrogen, and the interconnection of the electricity and 
gas sectors through hydrogen in the decarbonization process. 
In parallel with electrification, the security of energy supply will also be strengthened. 
In 2030, due to the parallel operation of the existing and new Paks units, Hungary will be a 
net exporter. Then, with the shutdown of the old nuclear power plant units, the country will 
become a net importer again. However, the import share in the EA scenario is only about half 
(16%) of today’s levels. In 2050, due to the significant renewable energy production capacity 
and  the  available  storage  capacity,  domestic  production  will  almost  completely  cover 
consumption (Hiba! A hivatkozási forrás nem található.).

Table 5 – SWOT analysis of industrial subsectors with high process emissions 
In modeling the decarbonization of industrial processes, the NCDS relied on a number of 
measures, good practices and technological solutions proposed by industry representatives. In 
addition to the use of renewable energy (mainly photovoltaics (PV)), the representatives of 
the companies drew attention to the need to increase the energy efficiency of production and 
to  save  energy  and  resources  (circular  economy).  According  to  the  proposals,  new 
technologies such as CCUS, green20 and blue21 hydrogen can help to further reduce the 
carbon footprint of production processes that become more efficient through production 
optimization, digitization and the “Internet of Things”. 
In addition, the development and introduction of new technologies requires the support of 
companies' RDI activities, the training of professionals and the future retraining of workers in 
certain industries (e.g. car manufacturing), as technology change (electrification) and robotics 
will restructure the sector's employment. 
Developments and main trends in past emissions 
GHG emissions from industrial processes are derived from their energy consumption (see 
Section  4.2.1),  and  the  industrial  processes  themselves  also  generate  significant  GHG 
emissions. 
For most industrial  activities, GHG emissions  come only from the  energy consumption 
required for production, but during certain industrial processes, such as cement production, 
ceramics  production,  chemical  industry  (e.g.  petrochemicals,  fertilizer  production),  large

amounts of greenhouse gases may be released into the atmosphere. These gases account for a 
very significant share of the country’s total anthropogenic emissions, about 10-12%. 
Compared to 1990 and the middle of the 2000, emissions related to industrial processes and 
product  use  are  developing  favorably  (Figure  35).  At  the  beginning  of  the  period,  the 
decrease in GHG emissions was due to the decline in industrial production after the change of 
regime and the subsequent economic and industrial restructuring. However, as industrial 
production increased, output began to increase again, although the economic crisis of 2008-
2009 resulted in another temporary decline. Emissions have risen again since 2010, but - 
despite dynamic economic growth - the sector's output is not even close to pre-crisis levels in 
2008-2009. Economic growth is increasing the GHG emissions associated with industrial 
processes to a lesser extent in specific terms, as the sector has undergone significant material 
and process efficiencies, while also improving energy efficiency.

is illustrated in Figure 36. It can be clearly seen that the ¾ of emissions is CO  emissions, 
2
but the share of fluorocarbons (F-gases) is also significant (19% in 2018). 
The vast majority of GHG emissions from industrial processes come from a few sub-sectors, 
and emissions are predominantly CO  emissions. In 2018, CO2 accounted for 79% of GHG 
2
emissions from  industrial  processes and product  use, with  methane and nitrogen oxides 
accounting for a further 12% and 8%, respectively.22

by gas type, 2000-2018 
Analyzing the development of emissions by subsectors (Table 6), it can be stated that the 
chemical  industry  clearly  dominates,  in  2018  the  sector  accounted  for  almost  37%  of 
emissions related to industrial processes and product use. Within this subsector, emissions 
are essentially related to petrochemicals (petroleum refining), ammonia production and 
nitric  acid  production.  Ammonia  production  is  basically  only  responsible  for  CO  
2
emissions, petrochemicals are mainly responsible for methane emissions, but the share of the 
sub-sector  in  CO   emissions  has  also  increased  (CO   emissions  in  the  sub-sector  have 
2 2
increased about 2.8 times compared to 1990). Emissions of nitrogen oxides are clearly caused 
by nitric acid production. For F-gases, 93% of emissions are from substances used to replace 
ozone depleting substances. 
In addition to the chemical industry, the metal industry (20%) and the production of 
mineral products (19%) also play a significant role. In the case of the former, almost all 
emissions are related to iron and steel production, but some emissions are also characteristic 
of aluminum production. With regard to the production of minerals, cement production is a 
major emitting subsector. Emissions from the metal industry also include CO  emissions and 
2
methane emissions, while cement production essentially produces only CO  emissions.

F-gases 
Substances that replace ozone-depleting substances, the so-called F-gases are powerful greenhouse gases that 
damage the climate a hundred times or even a thousand times more than carbon dioxide. They are widely 
used,  for  example  in  refrigeration  equipment,  air  conditioners,  fire-retardant  foams,  heat  pumps,  etc. 
Therefore, more and more stringent standards, labeling and regulations apply to the repair, maintenance and 
destruction of these devices. However, demand for air conditioning and refrigeration is projected to grow at a 
tremendous rate in the coming decades. It is therefore important that climate-damaging substances, like 
ozone-depleting substances, are phased out. In Hungary, the regulation of F-gases is determined by the legal 
acts of the EU: the F-Gas Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 517/2014) and the so-called MAC Directive 
(Directive 2006/40 / EC). The main provisions of the F-Gas Regulation are: 
  Limit the total amount of key F-gases that can be sold in the EU and gradually reduce it to one-fifth of 
2014 levels by 2030. 
  The use of F-gases is prohibited for appliances where a less harmful alternative is available (e.g. 
refrigerators or air conditioners in households or shopping malls)  
  Prevent the release of F-gases from existing equipment into the atmosphere by introducing regular 
inspections, proper servicing, and rules for proper discharge at the end of their life cycle. 
With the help of the F-Gas Regulation, F-gas emissions will be reduced by two thirds by 2030 compared to 
the 2014 value. In Hungary, approx. 2% of total GHG emissions are F-gases, which is below emissions from 
the industrial sector. According to the latest GHG inventory data, emissions from these gases decreased by 
about 25% from 2017 to 2018, reaching its highest level in 2015, but by 2018 it had fallen to a historic low. 
The main reason for this is the change in the quantity of used and sold equipment. Refrigeration and air 
conditioning equipment is undergoing significant changes, the main reason for which is the strict regulation 
introduced by the EU F-Gas Regulation. Hungary plans to further reduce F-gas emissions on the basis of the

ozone layer.

legislative framework of the EU. 
Steps to be taken in the field of industrial processes to achieve net zero GHG emissions at the 
national level 
In order to meet the net zero GHG emissions of 2050 at the national level, emissions related 
to industrial processes must be reduced to at least 200-250 thousand tons of CO eq/year by 
2
2050. 
Achieving the decarbonization goal in industry cannot be based on curbing production, 
instead efficiency investments and technological developments are needed. In order to 
effectively reduce process emissions, dramatic changes are needed in the future in those 
industrial  sub-sectors  that  account  for  a  significant  share  of  GHG  emissions,  namely 
petrochemicals, iron and steel, ammonia and cement. 
Emissions  of  nitrogen  oxides  (mainly  N O)  from  industrial  processes  can  be  reduced 
2
relatively quickly as early as 2030, although further reductions thereafter are limited. It will 
be possible to accelerate the reduction of CO  emissions in the longer term. 
2
In the industrial sector, in addition to the development of production/manufacturing processes 
and the increase of material efficiency, the use of CCUS technologies and alternative raw 
materials for the replacement of fossil-based energy sources used as certain raw materials 
may also be necessary in the future. Moreover, changing consumption patterns, and even 
more so the transition to a circular economy, will have a significant positive impact on 
reducing industrial emissions. The need to realize all of this is particularly shown by the fact 
that industrial production (chemical industry) and construction (and thus the demand for 
cement  and  iron  and  steel)  will  continue  to  expand,  so  without  further  interventions, 
emissions would increase two to three times by the middle of the century. 
 
Innovative technologies for decarbonization of industrial processes: hydrogen and CCUS  
In the future, carbon-free hydrogen and its derivatives, as well as CCUS technologies, may also play a key 
role in reducing emissions from industrial processes that are difficult to decarbonize. 
With regard to hydrogen use, iron and steel production could be one of the potential area of applications. Iron 
is produced by a fire metallurgical process from iron ores, in which oxygen is removed from the iron ore by 
reduction with coke. This causes significant carbon emissions. However, reduction with carbon-free or low-
carbon hydrogen may offer an alternative to decarbonized production. Hydrogen and its derivatives can also 
be used as a basis for decarbonizing chemical processes and petroleum refining. The production of fuels and 
chemical  products  is  largely  fossil-based,  primarily  hydrocarbon-based.  Fossil  hydrocarbons  used  as 
feedstock could be replaced in the future with synthetic hydrocarbons, which could be produced from CO  
2
and carbon-free hydrogen removed from the atmosphere or other processes. Carbon-free hydrogen can also 
be considered for the production of ammonia, so that the use of ammonia and the use of other ammonia-
based chemical products can also be made carbon-free. 
Due to its high energy density, hydrogen can also be a viable solution for extremely heat-intensive industrial 
processes such as steam cracking (chemical/refining), iron and steel production (where coke also provides 
process heat) and clinker production (cement industry). In the cement industry, another process, the so-called 
calcination also involves significant CO  emissions, which occur when limestone (which consists of 90% 
2
calcium carbonate (CaCO )) is heated and decomposes to calcium oxide (CaO) and CO . In practice, this 
3 2
emission could be reduced by CCUS technology. (CCUS can, of course, also offer a solution for reducing 
emissions from thermal energy-intensive processes.) 
 
In accordance with the above, the following factors need to be taken into account: 
  Economic development and climate protection should be coordinated. 
  60      
 
  In  addition  to  identifying  industries  with  high  process  emissions,  it  is  strongly 
recommended  to  identify  those  industries  related  to  sustainability  that  have  the 
potential to help strengthen the country's long-term competitiveness. 
  Reducing  GHG  emissions in  industry to  a minimum,  close to  zero, requires further 
modernization of production and process efficiency in certain sub-sectors. Digitization 
and automation are spreading further in the industry. In some cases, there may be a 
complete change in production technology in some areas, all on a market basis. 
  There is additional potential for material efficiency. The GHG reduction potential in this 
respect can be identified mainly in the construction industry and in the chemical industry. 
  CCUS technology will not only play a role in energy production, but also in making 
industrial processes more climate-friendly. Unfortunately, this technology does not yet 
offer a cost-effective alternative. (Further details on the technology can be found in 
Section 6.1.1.) 
  The replacement of fossil fuels (as raw materials) with alternative, “clean” raw materials 
will take place in the medium to long term. Hydrogen and its derivatives (e.g. synthetic 
methane, synthetic ammonia) as well as biomass-based fuels may offer an alternative to 
carbon-free materials in the future. (For more details on the technologies, see Sections 
4.2.1 and 6.1.1, respectively.) 
  By  reducing  the  amount  of  primary  raw  material  consumption,  significant  emission 
reductions can be realized, which can be achieved primarily by implementing a circular 
economy. Building a circular economy is inconceivable without an industrial symbiosis 
approach based on the ability of the waste generated by one industry to be used as a raw 
material by other industries; and the importance of promoting waste prevention, recycling 
and other treatment efforts, and the collection and energy recovery of landfill gas from 
landfills and wastewater treatment plants. With the spread of recycling, the production of 
many  industrial  products  such  as  steel,  glass  and  plastics  becomes  more  resource 
efficient.  Banning  single-use  plastics  generates  additional  positive  effects.  (See  also 
section 4.2.5 on waste management.) 
  The demand for raw materials and thus process emissions can be further reduced through 
effective attitude formation by changing consumption patterns. In this context, it should 
be noted that in the future, it would be important to make data on the carbon footprint of 
products and services available and transparent, so that conscious consumers can make 
informed choices. 
  A significant part of the technologies with the greatest potential for emission reductions 
are not yet considered mature enough. Moreover, many solutions are still in the early 
stages  of  development.  Therefore,  further  Research,  development  and  innovation 
(RDI) activities are needed to move forward. In this context, consideration should be 
given to redesigning the RDI incentive and tendering system to take greater account of 
the need to improve the resource efficiency of industrial processes for climate purposes. 
  It should be recognized and awareness should be raised that companies will only be able 
to meet the tightening standards and societal expectations and new competitive conditions 
created  by  the  decarbonization  transition  if  they  themselves  play  an  active  and 
responsible role in the transition, they develop and innovate. The role of the state is to 
facilitate  this ̶  primarily,  but  not  exclusively  -  by  creating  the  right  incentives  and 
predictable  framework  conditions.  (For  information  on  innovation  opportunities,  see 
Chapter 6. For possible sources of funding for innovation, see Chapters 5 and 6.) 
  61      
 
  Last but not least, there is a need to fully integrate climate change as a precondition into 
industrial development policies. 
Emissions from energy use by industry are described in subsection 4.2.1. 
Expected trends of the EU emission trading system (EU ETS)  
The EU ETS is a key tool among EU policies to combat climate change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
in a cost-effective way. It is the world’s first and largest carbon trading market. The EU ETS operates in all 
EU Member States, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. It covers more than 11,000 installations 
(power plants and industrial plants) and controls about 40% of greenhouse gas emissions for all countries 
covered.24  
The future of the EU ETS depends to a large extent on market integrity and a shared level of ambition, but 
the following trends are expected to shape the period ahead:25 
Proposal for an EU climate law and raising the EU's 2030 level of ambition: If the EU commits itself to a 
higher level of ambition, the ETS is expected to be strengthened within existing scope of installations. 
Strengthening and fine-tuning the EU ETS and then extending its scope to other sectors not currently covered 
could lead to consistency in carbon pricing. The revision of the EU ETS due to the higher EU climate target 
for 2030 means a revision of the carbon cap by increasing the linear reduction factor (LRF). 
EU ETS and energy system integration:  a strengthened EU ETS has a key role to play in gradually 
facilitating energy system integration and encouraging uptake of least cost emission reduction technologies 
and solutions.  
2021 review of the market stability reserve (MSR): The planned review of the functioning of the MSR in 
2021, which will ensure that the market balance is maintained, will be accompanied by a review of the EU 
ETS as a whole.  
Use of auctioning revenues:  Under the EU ETS Directive, Member States are required to devote at least half 
of the revenues from the sale of EU ETS general-purpose allowances and all of the resources from the sale of 
aviation allowances to climate and energy investments. In addition, during the revision of the EU ETS 
Directive adopted in 2018, the Modernization Fund was established to support energy and energy efficiency 
investments in 10 low-income Member States (such as Hungary). These countries continued to receive a 
support mechanism under Article 10c of the EU ETS Directive to modernize their energy systems. It is also 
important to mention the Innovation Fund, which supports the first large-scale demonstration projects of 
some innovative technologies.  
The EU ETS and the global carbon market: In the long run, the EU-ETS is expected to be linked to the 
carbon markets of other countries and regions in order to prevent carbon leakage and cost-effectively reduce 
global CO  emissions (where available). As a first step, in 2020, the interconnection with the Swiss ETS 
2
system became operational. 
 
Decarbonization pathways of industrial processes  
Under the BAU scenario, due to increasing production and without additional measures GHG 
emissions will double by 2050, exceeding 14 million tons of CO eq/year. According to the 
2
EA scenario, industrial processes will become slightly less carbon free in the medium 
term than the economy as a whole, but a significant further reduction can be achieved 
by  2050.  Emissions  reduction,  material,  process  and  energy  efficiency  measures  and 
technologies  (including,  inter  alia,  digitization  and  automation,  alternative  "clean"  raw 
materials) and even more so the transition to a circular economy will significantly reduce 
emissions to about 215 thousand tons of CO eq/year levels (Figure 37)

The domestic circular economy 
An important national economic and environmental goal is the so-called shift towards a "circular economy", 
i.e., the production and use of zero waste, the more efficient, economical and at the same time more sustainable 
use of natural resources, the utilization of waste as much as possible, taking into account the priority of the 
waste hierarchy. The ultimate goal is to create a circular economic system where metabolic processes flow in a 
closed system, with high levels of waste and by-products being utilized in their material. 
In order to start and gain the transition from the linear economy to the circular economy, the Circular Economy 
Platform was established in 2018. Within the platform, the professional work has already started, and a 
Working Group on the Circular Economy  has been formed to support it. In the field of research and 
development, Bay Zoltán Applied Research Public Benefit Nonprofit Ltd. has been involved in this work 
(circular economy, cascade-like utilization of resources, waste hierarchy, extended producer responsibility, 
industrial symbiosis and new business models) by looking at the practical challenges of the transition to a 
circular economy through their applied industrial RDI activities.

Developments and main trends in past emissions  
In  2018,  agriculture  contributed  11%  to  Hungary's  total  GHG  emissions.  Agricultural 
activities emit methane and nitrous oxide, and most of country’s nitrous oxide emissions 
(87%) come from this sector. The main sources of GHG emissions in the agricultural 
sector are nitrous oxide emissions from arable land, emissions from manure treatment 
(nitrous oxide and methane) and digestion of farm animals (methane). 
Emissions fell sharply between 1985 and 1995, when agricultural production fell by more 
than  30%  and  livestock  declined  significantly.  Between  1996  and  2008,  agricultural 
emissions stagnated at around 6.2 million tons with fluctuations of ± 5%. In the background, 
the opposite effect emerged: a further decline in livestock would have led to lower emissions, 
but a significant, 68% increase in fertilizer use between 1995 and 2007 led to increasing N O 
2
emissions  from  soils.  In  2008,  fertilizer  prices  rose  sharply,  leading  to  a  reduction  in 
consumption and, as a result, emissions from agriculture. 
Agricultural  emissions  decreased both  in 2009 and  2010 (Figure  38Figure  37). A more 
significant  decline  occurred  in  2009,  when,  in  addition  to  lower  fertilizer  use,  an  11% 
decrease in the number of pigs also contributed to the reduction in emissions. Following 
emissions in 2010, the lowest since the base year, GHG emissions from agriculture have been 
steadily increasing since 2011, mainly due to higher number of cattle, the increased use of 
fertilizers, as well as milk production per cow. This growing trend continued in 2018. In 
2018, GHG emissions from agriculture increased by 1.4% compared to 2017 and by 17% 
compared to 2005.

Figure 38 – Trend of agricultural GHG emissions by inventory category between 1990 and 
2018 
The structural change that has taken place in agriculture since 2004, and the fact that 
crop production has become dominant in relation to animal husbandry, can also be 
traced in GHG emissions. Since 2004, the share of methane emissions, mainly from 
livestock, has been declining and nitrous oxide, mainly from crop production, has been 
increasing.  Some  types  of  fertilizers,  such  as  urea-containing  fertilizers  and  the  lime-
ammonium nitrate type fertilizers contribute to GHG emissions not only due to their nitrogen 
but  also  their carbon  content.  In particular, due to  the  growing popularity  of the latter 
fertilizer in recent years, the associated N O and CO  emissions have tripled since 2005

between 1990 and 2018 
Since 2010, where the level of emissions was the lowest since the base year, GHG emissions 
from agriculture have been steadily increasing, mainly due to higher number of cattle, the 
increased use of fertilizers, as well as milk production per cow. 
Development policy goals for low GHG agriculture  
The "Climate Breakfast" consultations with representatives of civil society organizations and 
the industries drew attention to the need to place particular emphasis on the conservation of 
biodiversity and the promotion of organic farming in sustainable agricultural practices. In 
addition, the use of irrigation can lead to increased emissions. Irrigation will produce higher 
yields than farming without irrigation. Along with agricultural production, the green mass is 
also increasing, more soil life is to be expected, higher nutrient consumption and even more 
pesticide use are to be expected. Therefore, all these factors will increase GHG emissions, 
which must be taken into account. 
The most important tools for implementing low-carbon agriculture are: 
Transition to precision farming, extensive use of Agriculture 4.0 and 5.0 toolkit. 
● Precision farming and Agriculture 4.0 toolkit, i.e., solutions for remote sensing of water, nutrient, pathogen 
and environmental stress status of cultivated crops and the possibility of precision interventions. The goal of 
precision farming is to reduce the use of pesticides, fertilizers and water, to improve soil productivity while 
optimizing crop yields. With soil scanning, soil mapping and nutrient application planning, only the required 
amount of nutrients is actually applied. Logistics, energy and fuel consumption are optimized. In animal 
husbandry more sustainable farming is based on targeted interventions based on continuous animal health, 
nutrient supply and performance monitoring.  
● Nearly zero GHG/pollutant emissions based on agriculture 5.0 toolkit (robotics, drone-based remote 
sensing, automation, industrial protein, carbohydrate and bioactive substance production, molecular farming, 
functional fertilizers and functional food and feed production bioherbicides, biopesticides) material-free, 
waste-free management. 
Within the framework of the EU's common agricultural policy, the following measures are 
also expected to affect climate policy: 
  65      
 
-  reducing GHG emissions from agriculture through measures to increase yields; 
-  a 32% reduction in ammonia emissions from agriculture by 2030; 
-  enhancing  carbon  sequestration  (by  increasing  soil  organic  carbon  stocks  and 
biomass); 
-  improving the gross nutrient balance of the agricultural area; 
-  the  circular  use  of  plant  by-products  in  soil  management  and  biomass-based 
agriculture; 
-  launching pilot plants to demonstrate innovations in the biomass-based economy; 
-  increasing the size and proportion of areas covered by agri-environmental programs 
out of all agricultural areas; 
-  production of renewable energy of agricultural origin through the rational use of by-
products; 
-  encouraging  climate  protection  investments  and  agrotechnical  solutions  through 
producer cooperation. 
Long-term course of action  
By 2050, the goal is to fully integrate climate change into agricultural policies and practices 
as a precondition, taking into account decarbonization requirements and actual changes in 
climatic conditions. 
GHG emission reduction roadmap to 2050  
The purpose of the forecast of GHG emissions from agriculture is to show how different 
policy scenarios influence the development of anthropogenic emissions. The calculations are 
based on the latest National Inventory Report of 2018. The endpoint of the forecast is 2050, 
but it also includes information on intermediate dates. 
The following pollutant sources have been calculated for the estimation of GHG emissions 
from agricultural sources: methane from digestion, methane from manure treatment, direct 
nitrous oxide from manure treatment, indirect nitrous oxide from manure treatment, direct 
nitrous oxide from land use, direct nitrous oxide from land use, land use methane from rice 
cultivation, CO  from liming, CO  from urea-based fertilizers and CO  from other carbon 
2 2 2
fertilizers. 
The model predicts manure use based on agricultural areas as well as policy measures that 
determine the use of inorganic or organic fertilizers and the amount of manure used (e.g., 
using  precision  agricultural  techniques).  The  model  also  predicts  livestock  trends  and 
agricultural waste management practices (e.g., manure collection and use). 
For livestock, methane emissions are calculated based on the tier 1 methodology of the 
national  inventory  report.  Total  methane  emissions  from  livestock  can  be  estimated  by 
summing methane emissions from manure treatment and methane emissions from enteric 
fermentation. In the latter, methane emissions are caused by digestive processes and gases 
emitted by animals. In the former case, emissions from manure treatment can be calculated 
by multiplying the number of animals (e.g. pigs) by the manure production factor and the 
methane emission factors used. Historical time series were used by the model to ensure 
consistency between simulation results and reference emissions, and to account for changes 
in animal husbandry practices (e.g., feeding). 
Two  scenarios  have  been  developed  for  the  model,  based  on  assumptions  about  the 
macroeconomic  environment,  food  consumption,  demographic  change  and  the 
implementation of policy measures. (Figure 40) 
  66      
 
BAU Scenario: It builds on past measures to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture by the 
end of 2020. The basic assumption of the scenario is that the current free trade agreements 
will remain in force, the economic embargo against Russia will end in 2025, and eating habits 
will not change significantly. According to the scenario, the livestock will gradually increase 
on a market basis along with the use of nitrogen fertilizer. As a result of climate change, the 
yields of spring crops (maize, sunflowers) will decrease, while higher yields are expected for 
autumn crops (wheat, barley, rapeseed). According to the scenario, the slow, steady growth of 
GHG emissions started in 2011 will continue until 2050. Emissions are projected to reach 
7.679 million tons of CO eq/year by 2050 under the BAU scenario, which, despite a steady 
2
increase, is only 64.7% of agricultural GHG emissions in 1985. 
With subsidies and on a market basis, precision farming and Agriculture 4.0 is gaining 
ground, i.e., solutions for remote sensing of the water, nutrient, pathogen and environmental 
stress status of cultivated crops and the possibility of precision interventions. In animal 
husbandry precision farming and Agriculture 4.0 provides solutions for targeted interventions 
based on continuous animal health, nutrient supply and performance monitoring. 
EA Scenario: The scenario includes measures and innovative technological solutions that are 
in the research and experimental phase, but their implementation is conceivable - in case of 
appropriate EU and domestic regulations. 
Possible measures include restricting the use of nitrogen fertilizers by influencing prices, 
ending subsidies for beef cattle farming, tightening up the way fertilizer is applied, and state-
subsidized  cattle  selection  programs.  This  includes  awareness-raising  actions  to  change 
eating habits and possible administrative measures that could lead to a reduction in meat and 
milk consumption. 
In addition, innovation must play a key role in the decarbonization of the agricultural sector, 
as a result of which the sector will undergo a profound structural transformation. From the 
beginning of the 2030s entry into the digital age of agriculture will take place. As a result of a 
profound transformation based on innovation, a sustainable intensification of agricultural 
production will be reached, which could enable to produce up to 70% more food in 2050 in a 
more environmentally and climate-friendly way than at present. 
Implementing the BAU scenario would mean that emissions in the sector would increase by 
8.4% by 2050, from 7.085 million tons of CO eq/year in 2020 to 7.679 million tons of 
2
CO eq/year. In contrast, if the EA scenario is realized, GHG emissions from the agricultural 
2
sector  are  expected  to  decrease  by  70.46%  by  2050,  i.e.  from  7.085  million  tons  of 
CO eq/year in 2020 to 2.093 million tons of CO eq/year.

Figure 40 – Expected change of GHG emissions in the agricultural sector between 2016 and 
2050 in the event of the realization of the BAU and EA scenarios 
Under the EA scenario, the greatest GHG emission reduction potential arises from a 
substantial structural transformation; By 2050, at least 30% of the protein, carbohydrate, 
fat and bioactive needs of food and compound feed production will be produced in closed-
system  industrial  fermenters,  with  extraction  of  bred  yeast  and  unicellular  algae  from 
biomass, with a net climate-neutral balance, using renewable energy. This will allow the 
livestock sector to increase or partially replace the production of protein, fat and carbohydrate 
feedstocks with climate-neutral technologies. 
Further significant reductions in GHG emissions can be predicted from soil emissions, 
with the use of nitrogen fertilizer application through precision farming (continuous nitrogen 
(N) intake adapted to real plant nutrient supply) and innovations to date (development of 
functional N-fertilizers not available for soil micro-organisms that can only be used by higher 
plants, combining urea and other carbon fertilizers with biologically treated, continuously 
tested and composted sewage sludge and composted sludge remaining after biogasification). 
The composition of sewage sludge is not constant and therefore the risk is high due to 
contaminants that remain in sewage sludge or sewage sludge compost (heavy metals, drug 
residues,  pesticides,  etc.)  during  biological  treatment,  therefore  continuous  testing  is 
recommended. In particular, zinc can become dangerously enriched and, from there, can 
easily enter the crops grown through the soil and thus to higher levels of the food chain. 
However, emissions could fall by 90% from 3.639 million tons of CO eq/year in 2020 to 
2
0.364 million tons of CO eq/year by 2050. 
2
According to experts, the use of organic manure is mainly needed on arable land for nutrient 
replenishment. Proper organic matter management is an important condition for competitive 
and environmentally conscious agricultural production, so it is crucial how producers manage 
by-products, e.g. using straw and manure. The effects of the energy utilization of agricultural 
raw materials (biomass) directly and indirectly affect all nearly 180,000 Hungarian farmers 
with regard to the nutrient replenishment of soils. If no adequate nutrient supply provided to 
the soil, the biological activity and biota of the soil is not maintained and the humus levels are 
not increased, the soil will not be able to regenerate and, as a result, yields will fall drastically 
in the long run. 
In addition to serving the needs of other sectors, agriculture must also fulfill its own greening 
goals and tasks. The EU’s Farm to Fork strategy (which, together with the Biodiversity 
Strategy, serves the objectives of the new EGD) also expects farmers to significantly reduce 
their use of fertilizers: they must reduce the amount of fertilizer used by 20% by 2030, so the 
demand for manure is expected to increase within the sector as well. 
The application of organic fertilizers and the management of organic manure must therefore 
be part of precision farming, precisely adapted to current crop needs, both in time and 
quantity.  And  this  need  must  be  reflected  in  stricter  regulation  of  organic  manure 
management and support policy. If the measures proposed above are taken and successfully 
implemented, current emissions of 1.121 million tons CO eq/year from fertilizer treatment 
2
could be reduced by 82% to 0.200 million tons CO eq /year by 2050 using plant-specific and 
2
functional composite fertilizers. 
Within the agricultural sector, the smallest emission reductions are expected in the 
livestock sector, where emissions from digestion will decrease from 2.093 million tons 
CO eq/year in 2020 to 1.429 million tons CO eq/year by 2050. Although this represents 
2 2
  68      
 
almost  32%  lower  GHG  emissions  compared  to  the  base  year  of  2020,  it  does  not 
automatically mean a reduction in livestock. The increase in the proportion of industrial 
protein  production,  feed  innovations  resulting  in  lower  enteric  methane  emissions,  the 
intensive use of precision animal husbandry and the Agriculture 5.0 toolkit offer the potential 
to reduce GHG emissions even with increasing livestock. 
GHG emissions from more emission-marginal inventory sectors (rice cultivation, liming, 
urea-based fertilizers and other carbon-based fertilizers) are expected to total 0.100 million 
tons of CO eq/year in 2050.

Figure 41 – Net CO2 and ‘non-CO2’ emissions of the LULUC sector between 2020 and 2040 
Forests  contribute  to  mitigating  the  effects  of  climate  change  not  only  through  the 
sequestration of significant amounts of atmospheric CO2, but also through its temporary or 
permanent storage, the replacement of fossil fuels and their beneficial micro-, meso- and 
macroclimatic effects. 
The  LULUCF  sector  has  been  considered  a  GHG  sink  overall  in  recent  decades. 
However, there was more output from agriculture than this absorption, so the AFOLU sector 
(agriculture, forestry and other land use), which manages the two sectors together, was an 
overall net emitter in 2018. At the same time, an important precondition for Hungary's 
climate neutrality, is for the AFOLU sector to become a net CO2 sink by 2050, to the greatest 
extent possible. 
As discussed above, the main reason for the net sequestration of the LULUCF sector is 
the  substantial  CO   absorption  of  forests,  which  has  been  driven  by  significant 
2
afforestation and sustainable forest management in recent decades. The net absorption of 
the sector fluctuated significantly between 1985 and 2018, with an average annual absorption 
rate of 3.6 million tons of CO eq. According to the latest available data, in 2018, forests 
2
sequestered 4.4 million tons of CO . (Figure 42)

In addition to forests, temperate grasslands also play a role in sequestering CO , despite the 
2
risk of self-ignition of wet grasslands and peat soils. 
Development policy objectives to preserve the absorption capacity of the LULUCF sector 
During “Climate Breakfast” with representatives of civil society organizations and relevant 
industries, it was agreed that forest biomass could contribute to fossil fuel substitution and 
carbon sequestration through wood products and sustainable forest management. The basic 
condition for this is that afforestation should be more climate-conscious, i.e., tree species that 
are more resistant to climate change should be preferred, should be used and, where possible, 
the so-called transition to perennial forest management should be supported. 
Gradual change of management in order to preserve the absorption capacity and biodiversity of forests: 
Gradual transition from felling to perennial forest management in close-to-nature forests and in forests of 
native tree species where justified and feasible. 
● Logging or spatial management: 50% of Hungary’s forests are non-native and a significant proportion of 
such forests are almost monocultural, but efforts must be made to reduce the associated soil degradation and 
support natural regeneration. 
● Perennial forest management: the creation of mixed, stable forests of multi-aged, leveled, diverse structures 
and site-specific tree species in near-natural habitats where our native tree species live in natural associations 
and where this is supported by other considerations. 
According  to  paleobotanical  research,  the  forest  cover  of  the  Carpathian  Basin  was 
approximately 40% approx. 1000 years ago. But even at end of World War I, there was a 
high forest cover of around 27%, which fell to 11.8% by the end of World War II. As a result, 
  71      
 
Hungary has become the fourth poorest country in Europe in terms of forests and trees. Since 
then, the forest cover rate has improved significantly and currently it is above 20%. The 20% 
forest  cover  means  that  our  forests  occupy  approximately  1.9-2.0  million  hectares  of 
Hungary's 9.3 million hectares territory. 
However, the National Reforestation Program and the National Forest Strategy (NFS) 
set the goal of further increasing forest areas, as a result of which Hungary will reach 
27% of forest cover level again by 2050. This will require afforestation of an additional 
350,000-400,000 hectares, without counting in the legally non-forest wooded areas, while 
obviously continuing to manage the existing forests in a sustainable way, taking greater 
account of climate policy and biodiversity conservation objectives. 
Links with agricultural and rural development policies 
Among the forestry policies of the Hungarian Rural Development Program, there are a 
number of measures that help forests to adapt to climate change and increase their 
carbon sequestration capacity. It is important to stress that adaptation measures are crucial 
for the conservation of forest carbon stocks. The expected drier and warmer climate in many 
forest areas can lead to reduced growth, deterioration of tree health, multiplication of pests, 
and, in unfavorable cases, extinction processes, which should be prevented if possible. The 
measures  related  to  climate  change  in  the  2014-2020  rural  development  period  should 
therefore be maintained in the 2021-2027 period, and their expansion is even planned. 
The current Forest Act prioritizes the increase of forest areas that are more resistant to 
the effects of climate change, including continuous forest cover, and, in the case of 
native tree species, the establishment of mixed tree stocks close to nature. In order to 
increase  the  wooded  area  of  the  country,  a  national  afforestation  program  has  been 
announced, which will also mobilize the population to increase the wooded area. In addition 
to  the  tree  planting  programs,  the  unit  prices  of  the  afforestation  measure  of  the  rural 
development  program,  the  period  and  the  amount  of  income  replacement  support  were 
significantly increased. 
Other relevant measures: 
-  increased protection of forests, prevention of forest destruction, forest fires, mitigation 
of adverse effects; 
-  the  development  of  professional  forest  management,  which  provides  high-quality 
wood raw material and the wood industry capable of processing wood as much as 
possible, the replacement of raw materials and products produced with higher energy 
consumption and high GHG emissions; 
-  full integration of climate change as a precondition into forestry policy. 
Long-term course of action  
By 2050, climate change as a boundary condition must be fully integrated into forestry 
policies and practices, taking into account decarbonization requirements and actual climate 
change. 
GHG emission reduction roadmap to 2050 
The  GEM  model  predicts  emissions  from  forest  areas,  non-cultivated  areas  (fallow), 
agricultural and residential areas. Emissions from soil are calculated as the sum of emissions 
from each of the four land use categories. 
  72      
 
Emissions from the four land use categories are calculated by multiplying the given land use 
stock by an emission factor. Land use and emission factors are calibrated based on data from 
the national GHG inventory report. 
Emissions from the forest area - areas registered as forest parcels, free-range forests in the 
National Forest Stock Database, as well as woody plantations and other forest tree species 
meeting forest definitions in accordance with international forest definitions – are calculated 
by the model as the sum of (1) forest emissions using the forest stock and the emission factor 
for the forest area, (2) the decrease in carbon sequestration due to tree aging, and (3) the 
increase in carbon sequestration capacity due to afforestation. Emission projections (2) and 
(3) were determined using the BAU and EA scenarios. 
BAU scenario: It will be realized if between 2020 and 2050, based on the experience of 
recent years, a moderate afforestation will take place (3500 ha/year), which will not allow the 
goals set in the NFS to be met. As a result, forest cover will not increase significantly, and as 
the average age of forests increases, the mortality rate of tree stocks will increase. Gradually, 
old forests, which are decomposing their organic matter and becoming CO  emitters, are 
2
becoming predominant. In addition, the increase in the frequency of climate change-related 
habitat  “aridification”  and  extreme  weather  events  will  result  in  the  fragmentation  of 
country’s currently  closed mid-mountain  forests, and a significant  part of Hungary will 
become a forest-steppe during the 21st century (Figure 43).

Figure 43 – Expected change of forest cover and forest ecosystems by 2065 if the BAU 
scenario is realized 
EA scenario: if implemented this scenario allows to achieve the targets of the National 
Afforestation Program and the NFS, i.e., the forest cover rate will increase from the current 
20.8% to 27% by 2050, and the annual “net” afforestation will reach 13,000 hectares. 
Under the EA scenario, similarly to agriculture, digitization and automation tools are gaining 
more and more ground in forestry, and in the afforestation programs, predominantly more 
drought-tolerant propagating materials of our native tree species are used. 
In the area of support policy, consideration should be given to the fact that, under the 
international emissions trading scheme, part of the revenue from CO allowance trading 
2 
  73      
 
should be used for natural carbon sequestration, afforestation, long-term forest maintenance 
and the development emissions-optimal stock structure, that is climate resilient. Achieving 
these goals goes beyond the utilization restrictions still expected of forest owners, so the loss 
of expected economic benefits must be compensated. Spending part of the revenues from EU 
ETS in the forestry sector would be a significant source of increasing Hungary's forest cover.

GHG emission trends  
Since Hungary's accession to the EU, significant progress has been made in the field of waste 
management, which led to GHG reductions in the sector. The previous uncontrolled, approx. 
2,200 “landfills” operating or already abandoned without proper insulation and depot gas 
treatment were closed by 2009, and their recultivation took place by 2015. Based on 2018 
data,  75  "B3"26  landfill  operating  permits  comply  with  all  current  EU  regulations,  and 
technological equipment has been installed for the collection and treatment of approximately 
40% methane-containing landfill gas, which serve energy recovery and/or flaring of methane 
in the landfill gas. 
In Hungary, GHG emissions from waste-related activities and waste management accounted 
for 5.9% of total GHG emissions in 2018, with emissions from the sector showing a declining 
trend over the last 10 years (Figure 44). The main reason for this is the declining rate of 
methane-producing landfilling, while the amount of waste per capita stagnates with a small 
variance (1%).

In  2018,  landfilling  accounted  for  the  majority  of  emissions  (84%)  under  the  waste 
management sector which also include wastewater treatment (11%), composting and other 
biological treatment (4%) and non-energy waste incineration (1%). In contrast to other 
emitting sectors, emissions from waste management are 3% higher than in the base year of 
2004. However, emission growth stopped in the early 2000s and then fell by 19% between 
2005 and 2017. In landfills, waste decomposes over many years, meaning that waste disposed 
of years ago also has an impact on current emissions. However, the quantities of waste 
landfilled has decreased significantly over the last 10 years and the composition of landfilled 
waste has also changed (e.g., separate collection of green and paper waste has reduced the 
amount of biodegradable waste landfilled), resulting in reduced GHGs emissions. Emissions 
from wastewater treatment has also declined which is explained by the increasing number 
of dwellings connected to the public sewer and the increasing capacity of closed sludge 
fermenters built at larger wastewater treatment plants. 
Development policy objectives   
The EU legislation package on the circular economy came into force on 2 December 2015, 
defines the strategic plans for the next 10-15 years. The basis for future waste management is 
determined  by  this  approach,  which  prioritizes  sustainability  and  cooperation  between 
industry through the development of a more material- and energy-efficient economic model. 
Putting the circular economy into practice will help reduce GHG emissions. The legislative 
package has tightened up the existing waste management targets and identified other specific 
sub-targets. In order to achieve these goals, Hungary needs to significantly increase the 
amount  of  separately  collected  and  treated  waste  in  the  coming  years  and  minimize 
landfilling.  
Another important element is Directive 2019/904/EU of the European Parliament and of the 
Council of 5 June 2019 on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the 
environment (Single-Use Plastics Directive (SUP Directive)), i.e. it aims to prevent and 
reduce generation disposable plastics. The SUP Directive requires Member States to take 
specific prohibitive, restrictive and regulatory measures on packaging and non-packaging, 
single-use and oxidatively degradable plastic products and their waste. The most ambitious 
requirements include the targets for plastic beverage bottles in the SUP Directive. Under the 
specific targets, 77% of plastic beverage bottles should be collected separately by 2025 and 
  75      
 
90% by 2029, with the ultimate goal of making the recycling process more efficient. Another 
ambitious requirement is that, by 2025, the beverage bottles should be made from 25% 
secondary raw materials made from waste, and plastic beverage bottles should be made from 
30% secondary raw materials by 2030. To achieve this, the SUP Directive proposes the 
introduction of a redemption fee (deposit fee) system or setting a separate collection target 
under the extended producer responsibility scheme. 
Currently, 84% of the sector's GHG emissions come from landfills. According to the 
"circular economy" package, by 2035 a maximum of 10% of municipal waste generated can 
be landfilled (with a derogation of 25%), which means that, as a result of material flow 
calculations, only slag/residual waste from burning or energy generation can be disposed of 
in the future. This results in huge GHG savings, as the amount of slag/residue generated 
during energy recovery does not need to be included in the amount of landfilled municipal 
waste. 
Another  high-impact  provision  in  the  legislation-package  is  that  it  introduces  additional 
obligations for the period 2025-2035 (a derogation of up to 5 years may be requested under 
certain conditions): 
a) By 2025, the amount of recycled municipal waste and waste prepared for re-use 
should be increased to a minimum of 55% by weight (with a derogation of 50%); 
b) By 2030, the amount of recycled municipal waste and waste prepared for re-use 
should be increased to a minimum of 60% by weight (with a derogation of 55%); 
c) By 2035, the amount of recycled municipal waste and waste prepared for re-use 
should be increased to a minimum of 65% by weight (with a derogation of 60%). 
In order to prohibit and restrict the sales of single-use plastics in the framework of the 
transition to a circular economy, Hungary was among the first to adopt an act on the 
transposition of the SUP Directive (Act XCI of 2020) containing enabling provision for 
government decree-level regulation. The technical notification of the government decree is in 
progress, it can be promulgated after its completion and it will take effect from 1 July 2021. 
One of the biggest challenges in designing the National Waste Management Strategy 
currently under development and the new National Waste Management Plan, is that the 
transformation of the future waste composition is very difficult to plan, as producers and 
distributors  are  now  radically  transforming  the  packaging  and  other  parameters  of  their 
products, from a technology and material use perspective. 
The proportion of biodegradable waste (including a significant part of the fine fraction) in the 
current composition of municipal waste exceeds 30%. The treatment of that portion of the 
waste stream is determinant to achieve the recovery targets of the circular economy and for 
the sector's GHG emissions. Compliance with the separate collection obligation for biowaste 
must be ensured by 31 December 2023. 
During the stakeholder consultation held under the preparation of this Strategy, industry and 
professional organizations affirmed their commitment to prioritize the reuse and recovery of 
material, the reduction of biowaste and organizing the treatment of the small remaining 
waste. This is supported by sector guides to good practice developed in collaboration with 
industry in the framework of the National Food Chain Safety Agency's National Food Waste 
Prevention Program called “Without leftovers”. 
In the field of food retail, several chain stores operating in Hungary are already launching 
their own waste management programs. 
  76      
 
There is also strong interest in the development of biogas plants. According to the provisions 
of the Circular Economy  Directive package,  energy recovery or fuel  production do not 
contribute to the achievement of recovery targets, but it is expected to be clarified whether 
the utilization of fermented residues at the end of the anaerobic process as soil improvers can 
be accounted for. This can practically mean that if 20-30 units of the 100 units of material 
entering the energy recovery are utilized as slag or biogas residues, then the 20-30 units can 
be taken into account in the fulfillment of the circular economy targets. 
From the point of view of GHG emissions, aerobic composting of biodegradable waste is 
more advantageous compared to anaerobic treatment, because in case of improper sludge 
treatment,  significant  CO   and  methane  are  still  released  from  the  residue.  This  is 
2
technologically manageable but will definitely require special attention in the future. 
For the above reasons, the sector's GHG emissions will basically be determined by the 
following two main aspects:  
  The level of treatment and recovery of biodegradable, compostable waste (compost) 
must be increased. Closed technology anaerobic treatment technologies (biogas27, 
fermentation) do not sufficiently serve the goals of the circular strategy. Although 
energy recovery can play an important role and create synergies with EU energy and 
climate policy, it can only be accepted if it follows the principle of the EU waste 
hierarchy. 
  Expanding either recyclable packaging or selective collection to residential homes 
will generate multiple collection and transportation needs compared to the current 
one, which will increase transportation-related GHG emissions. 
GHG emission reductions roadmap to 2050 
In the first phase of the modeling four different scenario versions were developed based on 
the  policy  goals,  collection  and  treatment  rates  and  technology,  assuming  that  Hungary 
complies with the EU, i.e., makes the necessary investments in the next 10 years. A version 
selected on the basis of cost-effectiveness considerations and to meet the requirements of the 
Directive has been integrated into the GEM model to achieve climate policy targets, i.e., a 
lower-cost GHG emission reduction pathway. For the quantitative variants preceding the 
GEM model, the highest possible home composting prevalence was assumed (based on 
international,  already  realized  rates)  in  terms  of  cost-effectiveness,  that  does  not  entail 
transport and operating costs. The production of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) does not serve 
the purposes of the circular economy and is expected to decrease in terms of energy and cost 
savings. 
Among the main sectors within waste management (municipal, agricultural, industrial), focus 
was given to municipal waste on one hand due to the impact on GHG and on the other hand 
the challenges of the circular economy directive,  since the role of the state is decisive here. 
Quantitative forecasting of industrial waste follows the industrial performance of the GEM 
model, with treatment modality rates shifting toward full recovery by 2050. In this sector, the 
responsibility also lies at the EU level with waste producers. The amount of agricultural 
waste also varies in proportion to the agricultural performance of the GEM model; similar to 
industrial waste, the agriculture sector will be tasked with maximizing material recovery by 
2050.

Emissions from Composting and Anaerobic Digestion Plants (2012)   
  77      
 
Eventually, one scenario was selected optimized for cost-effectiveness, which became the 
proposed scenario in this strategy and was further processed in the GEM and TIMES models. 
Accordingly, two versions have been developed:  
-  BAU scenario: takes into account the effects of the measures adopted so far. In this 
scenario, all waste generation and management options will remain at the current 
level and will only change in proportion to population and GDP change. 
-  EA scenario: aims to achieve climate neutrality and waste management meeting the 
expectations of the circular economy will be achieved by 2030.  
It is important to note that the third applied, EA scenario, the LA scenario that was used for 
the other sectors is the same as the EA scenario for the waste sector, as the circular directives 
requires the achievement of the sectoral targets by 2030 and 2035, respectively, which at the 
same time, also serve the 2050 climate targets.  
In order to achieve the target of a very high recycling rate, biodegradable and compostable 
waste must be treated primarily through composting technology, which can be used as a soil 
improver. Currently, aerobic composting technologies represent the lowest GHG emissions 
within different biological treatments, so this practice was integrated in the EA scenario. In 
addition  to  central,  mechanized composting plants, it is  also  very important to  increase 
residential composting capacities. 
 
Innovative waste management technologies and solutions 
  “Smart” solutions: construction of radio-frequency identifiers for residential and institutional collection 
containers,  container  saturation  signaling  systems  for  industrial  waste,  development  of  real-time 
optimization software, tracking in case of redemption fee packages, waste collection vending machines. 
  Development of solutions accompanied by alternative energy utilization (pyrolysis, depolymerization, etc.) 
by maximizing material utilization (production of chemical secondary raw materials). 
  Dissemination of home composting: extensive awareness raising about the correct use of composting bins. 
  Development of industrial production processes towards waste-free processes: food industry, automotive 
industry, chemical industry. 
  Encourage collaboration between universities, research centers and sectors. 
To  achieve  65%  material  recovery  rate  by  2035,  all  packaging  material  (i.e.,  metals, 
plastics, paper, glass, etc.) must be collected. A redemption system for plastic bottles with 
an extremely high collection rate of over 90%, or a selective collection at least four times 
more frequent than at present, is also possible, but a combination of these is more likely. 
In  the  case  of  GHG  emissions,  the  growing  waste  transport  demand  was  taken  into 
account. The excess emission of this activity is accounted for in the transport sector by the 
TIMES model (the waste transport performance was 29.957 million km in 2019, which is 
expected to increase to 45.510 million km/year in 2030 and 44.347 million km/year in 2050). 
This  is  explained  by  the  specific  transposition  and  detailed  regulation  of  the  waste 
management directives aimed at the implementation of the circular economy in the Member 
States is still in progress. 
Material utilization results in huge savings in terms of GHG emissions28, as primary raw 
materials are replaced with secondary ones.

Research, May 2016) 
  78      
 
 
GHG potential of material recovery (illustrative examples): 
  Recovery of 1 ton of plastic waste = 2300 kg CO2eq savings 
  Recovery of 1 ton of metal waste = 1750 kg CO2eq savings 
  Recovery of 1 ton of paper waste = 795 kg CO2eq savings 
  Recovery of 1 ton of glass waste = 529 kg CO2eq savings 
In addition to significantly reducing GHG emissions in the waste management sector, the EA 
scenario also results in cost savings due to declining labor demand, especially for industrial 
waste management. The declining demand for labor by 2050 is caused by the decreasing 
trend  in  the  amount  of  waste  generated.  On  the  one  hand,  the  expectations  placed  on 
manufacturers will eliminate packaging that is difficult or impossible to recycle, and in the 
case of short-lived products, materials that simplify recycling (especially secondary raw 
materials) will displace current materials. 
It is expected that difficult-to-handle composite packaging will disappear, auxiliaries and by-
products in industrial processes will not become waste, as manufacturers will be forced to 
form an industrial symbiosis with activities in which the by-product of one process is used at 
the place of origin. Thus, activities are transferred from the waste management sector to the 
internal processes of producers/manufacturers, and in the waste management sector, the need 
for equipment and labor is drastically reduced due to the reduction of the amount of waste. 
The use of redemption systems  is  expected to  expand or become more comprehensive, 
replacing today’s containerized waste collection systems. This frees up high-value vehicles, 
equipment, and labor. 
The  regulations  of  the  circular  economy  clearly  serve  the  drastic  reduction  of  waste 
generation,  and  it  can  be  rightly  assumed  that  after  2030-2035  further  international 
regulations and conventions will be concluded in order to prevent the generation of waste.

  79      
 
According to the results shown in the table above, the investment costs required for the 
introduction of a circular economy by 2030 are significantly higher for municipal waste in the 
case of the EA scenario (2030: ~ 407 billion HUF, 2050: 202 billion HUF) compared to the 
BAU scenario. This can be attributed to the replacement and average investment costs of the 
equipment  needed  for  the  transformation  (construction  of  incineration  and  pre-treatment 
capacities), while operating costs are already declining. In the case of industrial waste, the 
costs of the waste management sector in the current sense will be eliminated (therefore 0% 
compared to the BAU scenario). Overall, this offsets the growing need for investment in case 
of municipal waste treatment, and the absence of industrial waste treatment results in net 
savings for the sector as a whole. 
The  GHG  emission  projection  for  the  waste  sector  until  2050  under  each  scenario  is 
illustrated in Figure 45. According to this, the sector's output will increase linearly with GDP 
growth in the BAU scenario. In contrast, in the EA scenario, emissions are reduced to one-
tenth of the base value.

Figure 46 – Forecast of GHG emissions from waste management by subsector according to 
the EA scenario 
As shown in the figure, full recycle of industrial waste is expected. Mandatory use of 
secondary raw materials will become an integral part of industrial material management 
and will generate a demand market for secondary raw material. The responsibilities of the 
circular economy directives fall on the producers, which is expected to be further enhanced 
by regulatory and voluntary commitments of industries. A significant part of the materials 
currently treated as waste will not appear as waste in the future or will remain the property of 
the producer/manufacturer, e.g. the pallets and packaging used in logistics are only “lent” to 
the buyer and taken back by the producer, and then reused in his own production and logistics 
processes. The economic basis for this approach has already been laid down in the form of a 
circular  extended  producer  responsibility  (EPR)  fee,  and  the  legislator's  intention  is  to 
provide an economic incentive towards a real “Zero waste”. 
In short, the following measures need to be introduced: 
  In addition to regulation, economic incentives and infrastructure development, there is 
a need for effective public awareness raising to encourage prevention, informed 
shopping and the disposal of waste under a new scheme. 
  In addition to the existing ~ 400,000 t/year energy utilization of mixed municipal 
waste, an additional ~ 800,000 t/year new, modern, high energy efficiency (min. 60%) 
incinerator capacity is required.  
  The share of home and community composting should be increased from about 55 
thousand t/year to ~ 220 thousand t/year. 
  A minimum of 60% of the generated waste must be diverted from the currently mixed 
municipal waste stream (using selective collection, a redemption system, or another 
selective collection scheme, or a combination of these options). 
  When manufacturing and placing new products on the market, the highest possible 
mandatory secondary raw material use rate should be prescribed, which leads to 
net GHG savings and generates revenue for the waste sector. 
  By 2050, the full recovery of industrial waste will be at zero-cost for the waste 
sector due to proper product design and the closed loop of production systems. The 
costs  will  remain  within  the  industrial  sector,  not  separated  from  product 
manufacturing and logistics processes (the operating and investment costs incurred 
have already been included in the costs of the industrial sector). 
 
4.3. Socioeconomic impacts 
Key  message:  The  decarbonization  of  the  Hungarian  economy  will  deliver  significant 
socioeconomic benefits 
This Strategy assessed two main types of societal outcomes of low-carbon interventions: (i) 
avoided costs and added benefits and (ii) employment impacts. Among the avoided costs, 
avoided  energy  and  fertilizer  use  (material),  reduced  transport-related  externalities  (i.e.., 
accidents, air pollution), and the social cost of carbon (SCC) (non-material) were estimated. 
Among  added  benefits,  the  increase  in  GDP  and  government  revenues  because  of  cost 
reductions and improved labor productivity were considered.  
   
  81      
 
The economic viability of investments aimed at reducing GHG emissions has been analyzed for decades. The 
approach used, in most instances, has been a conventional Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA). This takes (i) the 
implementation costs of projects and policies (i.e., the investment required, as well as the operation and 
maintenance cost) and (ii) the direct benefits generated by the same projects or policies. Moreover, CBAs are 
normally applied to a single project or investment and consider benefits only available for investors. These 
benefits are usually limited to those expressed in monetary units. Standard project-based CBAs do not assess the 
tangible/material and intangible, non-material benefits (or costs) of a given investment to society, regardless of 
if they are monetized or not. Nevertheless, investments in low carbon development are designed to tackle a 
societal issue such as climate change that affects many economic actors simultaneously. Investments in energy 
efficiency for instance, reduce energy consumption and curb emissions, while at the same time, the co-benefit of 
avoided energy use, reduced air pollution and health costs emerge. Therefore, to carry out a comprehensive 
assessment of climate mitigation interventions and socio-economic value of such investments in a coherent way, 
societal impacts need to be estimated. This type of extended CBA, i.e., assessing societal impacts, has become a 
common practice the last years in analyzing the costs and benefits of low carbon development scenarios. 
 
4.3.1. Avoided costs and added benefits 
All  avoided  costs  and  added  benefits  (Table  11)  account  for  nearly  half  of  the  total 
investments required between 2020 and 2030 according to the EA scenario.  
This indicates that in the next 10 years, more than half of the investments required will 
be repaid via avoided costs. When we consider added benefits as well (i.e., higher GDP and 
its impact on government revenues), 90% of the total investments required will be paid 
back according to the EA scenario over the same period. When the long-term horizon up to 
2050 is considered, the values of avoided costs and added benefits outweigh the investment 
costs. This is because a longer time frame will better capture the benefits of investments over 
their lifetime (i.e., the same investment reaches higher avoided costs and added benefits in 
the longer term).  
During the period between 2030 and 2050, a higher investment need is expected, which is 
explained by a larger-scale emission reduction effort necessary to reach the 2050 climate 
neutrality  target.  The  cost  to  reduce  each  ton  of  emission  is  increasing  as  the  full 
decarbonization  approaches.  Therefore,  under  the  EA  scenario,  the  total  avoided  costs 
account  for two thirds of the total investment  costs by 2050. Furthermore,  the sum of 
avoided costs and added benefits by 2050 will be higher than the investment costs.  
It should be highlighted that the avoided costs and added benefits are expected to occur well 
beyond 2050. This is because the investments made between 2040 and 2050 have a lifetime 
that stretches beyond 2050, reaching even 2060 and 2070. The benefits emerging after 2050 
were not captured in the present modeling exercises.  
Concerning avoided costs, the EA scenario shows roughly equal reductions in energy costs, 
the  SCC29,  and  transport-related  externalities.30  It  is  estimated  that  the  SCC  in  2020 
represents about 1% of GDP. With the full decarbonization of the economy by 2050, the SCC 
will decline to zero. While being an intangible indicator—since it is not directly linked with 
public and private expenses—it may indicate that Hungary and many Member States of the 
                                                 
29 The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is a widely used proxy indictor to express the economic impacts of climate 
change. It indicates the marginal cost that is caused by each extra emitted ton of GHG.  
30 Transport-related externalities include the costs of accidents as well as the costs from caused noise and air 
pollution. 
  82      
 
EU will move effectively toward decarbonization, and that the cost of climate change will 
decline when compared to the BAU scenario.  
Transport-related externalities—including the cost of respiratory diseases due to air pollution, 
cost of noise pollution, cost of accidents, and value of time lost due to congestion—reach 
approximately 2% of GDP in 2020. According to the forecasts, in the case of the carbon 
neutrality scenarios—especially under the EA  scenario—the number of vehicles will be 
higher.  This  trend  will  increase  the  demand  for  transport  and  energy  consumption. 
Nevertheless, the shift to low-carbon vehicles will reduce the incidence of transport-related 
externalities on GDP by 0.2%–0.3% in the coming three decades.  
Concerning  added  benefits,  due  to  higher  investment  efforts,  lower  energy  costs,  and 
increased productivity, GDP is forecasted to be 21% higher under the EA scenario, compared 
to the BAU scenario by 2050.  
Many factors impact productivity31 in the model, such as the applied technology, energy 
costs, air and water quality, and infrastructure (e.g., roads). Low-carbon development reduces 
energy costs and emissions, which directly impacts productivity and the increase of GDP. 
Additional increases of GDP induce new investments and create new jobs, thus it further 
incentivizes economic development.  
When compared to the BAU scenario, the GDP growth rate is similar until 2025 but grows 
faster from 2026 to 2050. This is due to net savings generated by investments, energy 
efficiency, and a fuel switch. The annual growth rate of GDP will be 0.11 percentage points 
higher in the EA than under the BAU scenario. In addition, GDP is forecasted to grow more 
markedly toward 2050.  
ntForecasts  show  that  the  average  annual  growth  rate  between  2030  and  2050  is  0.61 
percentage points higher in the EA scenario than in the BAU scenario. In 2050, the growth 
rate of GDP—partly driven by green investments—in the EA scenario is 7.03%, which is 
significantly higher compared to the BAU scenario at 1.79%.  
Government revenues follow a similar trend to GDP. Since government revenues are 
calculated from the growth rate percentage of GDP, higher GDP growth results in higher 
government  revenues.  By  2050,  the  additional  government  revenues  generated  by 
decarbonization measures will account for 47% of the investments required in the EA 
scenario. This means that the expected growth in tax revenues will cover nearly half of the 
investments required; therefore, state stimulation at this scale will not bring additional costs 
for the government. 
Table 11 - besides representing the demonstrable costs and benefits of the EA and LA 
scenarios over the 2020–2030 and 2020–2050 periods, compared to the BAU scenario - also 
provides information on investment cost trends and labor market impacts.

4.3.2. Job creation for the low-carbon transition  
Reaching climate neutrality by 2050 would require transformational change and substantial 
investments in all relevant sectors in the next years and decades. Nevertheless, the process of 
decarbonization  in all  economic sectors  will  create considerable  employment 
opportunities, assuring increased prosperity for the Hungarian people in the long term. This is 
very much needed in the context of a successful and long-term recovery from the economic 
crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.     
The employment effects of the decarbonization of selected sectors and subsectors on the 
Hungarian economy have been analyzed. In particular, the potential of direct net employment 
creation  in  the  power  sector,  energy  efficiency,  bus  transport,  waste  management,  and 
reforestation, as well as indirect  employment driven mainly by higher GDP and higher 
productivity, were the focus of the assessment. Investments in these sectors will not only 
create  jobs  in  the  green  industries  (i.e.,  direct  jobs)  but  will  also  drive  economic  and 
employment opportunities in other economic sectors and have a spillover effect on the overall 
economy (indirect jobs). 
Table 11 summarizes the net direct and indirect job employment opportunities that will be 
created by investments in decarbonizing the Hungarian economy under the EA and LA 
scenarios by 2050, compared to the BAU scenario. According to the EA and LA scenarios, 
approximately 183,000 and 124,000 additional jobs will be created by 2050, respectively. 
Direct  employment  creation  refers  to  jobs  created  within  the  country  as  the  result  of 
interventions in the fields of power generation, energy efficiency, public transport, waste 
  84      
 
management, and forestry in the phases of building, operation, and maintenance. Indirect 
employment creation is the result of macroeconomic impacts of low-carbon investments, 
mainly in the industrial and service sectors. For example, energy efficiency measures reduce 
energy costs, which is followed by increased productivity and therefore a higher GDP. The 
higher GDP also increases the level of consumption and investments. Employment creation is 
the result of higher consumption and expenditures as well as the expansion of productivity, 
which is caused by the accumulated impacts of investments.  
Investments related to the decarbonization of the energy sector, clean energy infrastructure, 
and  increased  renewable  energy  capacities  can  create  an  additional  net  41,000  (EA 
scenario) and 38,000 (LA scenario) direct jobs by 2050 compared to the BAU scenario. 
In the LA scenario, job creation will play a prominent role from 2045 onward since this is 
when a significant increase in climate neutrality investments can be expected. In comparison, 
the EA scenario shows a more gradual approach, which brings more consistent job creation 
during the whole modeled period (Figure 47).

Figure  48  represents  the  development  of  additional  jobs  created  under  the  EA  and  LA 
scenarios. As discussed earlier, the EA scenario shows a more progressive decarbonization 
pattern that generates more jobs by 2050.

Figure 48 – Indirect job creation in the EA and LA scenarios compared to the BAU scenario 
A well-managed consideration and planning of employment shifts is needed to ensure a 
socially  just  transition.  The  creation  of  green  and  direct  jobs  is  at  the  heart  of  the 
socioeconomic benefits from the decarbonization of the Hungarian economy. Creating new, 
green, and well-paying jobs is of utmost importance in regions affected by the coal phase-out, 
which would contribute to the financial growth of families. Measures such as (re)training 
programs, enhanced university and education curricula, as well as supporting and improving 
green innovations and entrepreneurship by making it easier to create green businesses—with 
incubation services—will ensure a just transition.  
A well-managed approach to the transition to a decarbonized economy is necessary to avoid 
or minimize any adverse impacts to workers, communities, and businesses in regions that will 
be most affected by the transition. Engaging with the affected stakeholders and introducing 
policies for social protection, retraining, and reskilling are important enabling factors of a 
smooth and fair transition assuring prosperity for all Hungarians. 
 
4.3.3. Linkages with the UN Sustainable Development Goals  
Reducing GHG emissions generates a variety of co-benefits which can be identified by their 
contributions to the UN SDGs. First, the implementation of low-carbon investments (SDG13) 
leads  to  employment  creation  (SDG8)  and  the  generation  of  new  skills  and  knowledge 
(SDG4). In the case of the energy sector, these investments improve the expansion of clean 
and affordable energy (SDG7). Investments in energy and waste management also improve 
the creating of domestic value chains (SDG9). The result of low carbon investments is 
reduced energy use, waste creation and the increase of natural sink capacities which represent 
progress  towards  responsible  production  and  consumption  (SDG12)  as  well  as  towards 
sustainable cities and communities (SDG11). This also strengthens health outcomes (SDG3) 
via the reduction of air and water pollution (SDG6), by increased physical activity and better 
nutrition from interventions in the agriculture sector (SDG2).  
 
4.4. Adaptation policies and measures  
Adaptation to the unavoidable impacts of climate change is as important as emission 
reduction efforts for Hungary. Long-term adaptation priorities should be laid out jointly 
with the mitigation planning in order to fully seize the opportunities of the synergies between 
the two areas.32 This joint planning is also important because the necessary investments for 
adaptation determine development. Furthermore, adaptation activities contribute to important 
socio-economic goals and can bring added mitigation benefits. This applies vice versa since 
mitigation measures can have added adaptation benefits as well. This aspect has been taken 
into  account  during  the  preparation  of  the  NCDS.  In  addition,  those  mitigation  policy 
recommendations  that  are  contradictory  i  with  adaptation  objectives  should  only  be 
considered as a last resort.  
   
                                                 
32 A good example for this is the revision of requirements related to the planning of renewable energy facilities 
in the power sector that foster mitigation taking weather conditions impacted by climate change into account 
that risk critical infrastructures.  
  86      
 
4.4.1. Adaptation-related climate policy planning  
The EU Adaptation Strategy33 set three main goals for its member states:  
  to support member state-level interventions, especially the preparation of national and 
municipal climate strategies; 
  to strengthen the information database of decision-making, and  
  to integrate the adaptation goals in the most affected sectors.  
Hungary, fulfilling these requirements, accepted the National Adaptation Strategy (NAS) in 
2018 with 6 specific goals that guide adaptation policy planning:  
1) the protection of natural resources;  
2) the adaptation of vulnerable regions;  
3) the adaptation of vulnerable sectors;  
4) the adaptation of policies areas with national strategic importance;  
5) the adaptation of society; and 
6) the strenghtening of activities that target related research, development and innovation. 
The NAS outlines the concrete directions at short-, mid- and long-term for those Hungarian 
sectors that are mostly affected by climate change impacts. The implementation of the NAS 
is supported by actions plans that cover periods for 3 years each.  
In January 2020, the Hungarian Government adopted the Report on the scientific assessment 
of the possible effects of climate change on the Carpathian Basin34. This also summarizes the 
most important challenges in the field of adaptation based on the most recent scientific 
literature available.  
4.4.2. Potential response measures and interventions  
In the case of water management, the problems related to water scarcity and water surplus 
need to be addressed, as well as flood defenses and the prevention of floods and flashfloods  
caused by torrential rain. In order to moderate the severity of water scarcity, it is essential to 
keep the natural precipitation  in place at  all areas (farmers, population, settlements).  In 
regularly flooded areas, it may be necessary to review land use and to plan flood control and 
land use integratedly. An important tool for adaptation is the storage of natural precipitation 
in the ground, as well as the expansion of water-saving irrigation methods. 
Climate  change-related  damage  to  agriculture  is  strongly  linked  to  water  management 
because an increase in the tendency to drought may pose the greatest risk to agriculture in the 
future. Hence, it is particularly important to develop land use - and a system of incentives for 
change - that will help reduce extreme weather impacts and ensure that soil fertility is 
maintained in the long term. Dissemination of natural water replenishment and conservation-
friendly irrigation systems is key. Adaptive soil management, water management and the 
cultivation of plants suitable for the landscape can be used to prevent soil isolation and soil 
acidification.

  87      
 
Forests also play a prominent role in carbon sequestration and adaptation. It is therefore 
important to increase forested areas, depending on the conditions of production that change as 
a result of climate change, by using mainly native tree species that  meet  the changing 
conditions of production. 
Preserving natural and close to natural ecosystems and restoring degraded ecosystems will 
help adapt to the effects of climate change. This requires the mapping of ecosystem services 
and the coordinated development of elements of “green infrastructure”. 
In order to prevent the harmful effects of climate change on human health, it is necessary 
to prepare both the institutional system and its employees, as well as the population, for the 
intensifying effects of climate change and the possibilities of protection. It is necessary to 
compile  action  plans  at  the  institutional  and municipal  level  as  well,  and  to  create  the 
possibility of cooling in institutions taking care of vulnerable groups (eg hospitals, social 
institutions). It is important to control the prevalence of animal carriers and  to monitor 
infection data. Preparing for climate change emergencies and rapid public health responses is 
of key importance.  
Municipalities  have  a  wide  range  of  options  for  preventing  and  managing  the  climate 
impacts  that  affect  them.  It  is  recommended  to  continue  and  further  encourage  the 
development  of  adaptation  strategies  with  a  focus  on  adaptation  at  the  settlement  and 
community level, which has started in recent years, together with the related local awareness-
raising activities. It is essential that adaptation and sustainability aspects are consistently 
integrated  and  reflected  in  agglomeration,  settlement  development  and  town  planning. 
Furthermore, in the construction sector, adaptation and sustainability aspects need to be 
consistently incorporated and presented in the strategic and planning documents as well as 
construction and land-use rules have to reviewed, tightened and enforced taking climate 
change into account. A detailed review of the design and construction conditions of the 
municipal green space system, as well as the system of rules concerning elimination and 
felling, is also essential. Registering, planned expansion and quality development of green 
spaces to improve adaptability and strengthen absorption capacities locally is a key task. The 
safe collection, retention and utilization of precipitation requires the climate-safe removal or 
conversion of municipal stormwater management systems. Investigation of the storm damage 
vulnerability of the municipal building stock and damage risk analysis can also help to 
prepare for and develop effective, innovative responses. 
The adaptation of the transport sector can be interpreted from the infrastructure and from its 
users’ perspective. An important task is to prepare the transport infrastructure for extreme 
weather events (heat waves, storms, extreme precipitation), by developing related action 
plans and specific interventions (e.g. the use of more heat-resistant pavements). During 
transport developments, alternative, environmentally friendly, sustainable (eg fixed-track) 
modes of transport are preferred. 
In addition to being one of the largest emitters, the energy sector is also a  affected in 
adaptation. In the future, in line with changing weather elements and trends, it is necessary to 
consistently integrate the consideration of climate risks into power plant and energy (gas, 
electricity and district heating) infrastructure planning. The development of a climate risk 
assessment methodology that takes into account the actual chains of impact is key to the 
“climate  security”  of  the  energy  production  and  distribution  network.  The  reserves  of 
weather-dependent renewable energy sources and their sustainable utilization possibilities 
need to be reviewed in view of the expected climate change, revealing domestic potentials 
(e.g. the use of geothermal energy as a weather-independent renewable energy source). 
  88      
 
Besides avoiding preventing and preparing for disasters, it is also an important task to 
mitigate the already occured damages. A key goal is to develop defense and forecasting 
systems together with neighboring countries, and to coordinate action. Preparing for the 
potential municipal consequences arising from climate risks is also a task at the level of local 
governments in the field of food safety, flood risk and drinking water protection as well as 
critical infrastructure protection and industrial safety. At the municipal level, a further task is 
to assess the areas sensitive to surface movements, to review the existing landfills, slurry and 
sludge reservoirs and tailings ponds, as well as the areas potentially designated for landfill. 
In the tourism sector, the two main trends are to strengthen and disseminate adaptation 
knowledge bases and to encourage local responses. Within the framework of the former 
pillar, the central methodology development can take place in order to develop destination 
risk analyzes and vulnerability studies. The elaboration of related destination-level practice-
oriented climate risk assessment and the development of guidelines, aids, manuals, related 
training, event organization and curriculum development in support of strategic planning in 
the field of tourism also support these trends. In the field of tourism, the climate-conscious 
approach is gaining more ground due to the climate awareness of the actors of the sector 
regarding  the  effects  and  consequences  of  climate  change.  Another  important  group  of 
concrete local responses in attraction development is product diversification, the promotion 
of indoor products in the host area and the promotion of domestic tourism as well as the 
application of energy and water saving investments and product development adapted to 
climate effects in general. 
 
4.5. Cross cutting policies 
The entire system of public organizations, the society and all sectors of the economy must 
play their part in the fight against climate change. Sectors that play a key role in reducing 
GHG emissions and increasing GHG sequestration (Chapter 4), as well as enabling funding 
(Chapter 5) and supporting RDI (Chapter 6), are discussed in separate parts of this strategy. 
However, it is also necessary to talk about those cross-cutting areas that cannot be clearly 
classified into the examined sectors, which significantly facilitate the effective transition to 
climate neutrality. These are areas that can have a positive impact on processes in all emitting 
and absorbing sectors. The Preamble to the Paris Agreement also highlights cross-cutting 
issues that are crucial for the effective implementation. These are: 
  education and training,  
  public access to information, social consciousness, 
  full participation and cooperation of all levels of government and stakeholders,  
  sustainable lifestyles and sustainable consumption and production patterns. 
 
4.5.1. Education and training 
Article 12 of the Paris Agreement prescribes that "The Parties shall cooperate, as appropriate, 
in promoting measures to support education and training on climate change, recognizing the 
importance  of  these  steps  in  enhancing  actions  set  out  in  this  Agreement."  The  Paris 
Agreement reaffirms the key role of education and training. As discussed in the NCCS-2, it is 
of particular importance to shape attitudes through education in which sustainability issues 
are presented in an integrated way, not in isolation. Knowledge that draws attention and 
teaches consciousness about sustainable development needs to be incorporated into curricula. 
  89      
 
With a commitment to the environment, the professionals of the future need to implement 
ideas that take the impact of their activities on the environment into account. 
In primary and secondary education, the National Core Curriculum (NAT)35 already 
reflects these important aspects. Between the first and eighth grade, the main topics include 
“preserving the order of nature for sustainability”. Among the learning outcomes, the aspects 
of  sustainability  appear  in  a  specifically  practice-oriented  way.36  The  NAT  also  sets 
additional  sustainability  requirements  for  more  senior  years.37  There  is  also  a  non-
governmental organization in Hungary to promote the above goals. 38 
The same approach is needed in higher education, where it is necessary to transfer 
comprehensive  and  special  knowledge  related  to  sustainability  and  climate  change, 
adapted to the needs and aspects of each specialization. In these areas of higher education 
(e.g.  medical  training,  disaster  management,  economics,  engineering,  law  training,  etc.) 
understanding  climate  change  and  global  environmental  issues  is  particularly  important, 
especially for the effective climate-neutral transition and preparedness for the unavoidable 
impacts.  The  (re)training  of  professionals  competent  to  develop  and/or  apply  new 
technologies  and  processes  is  key  to  achieving  climate  neutrality  goals.  Therefore,  the 
identification of relevant areas of higher education and other vocational training and the 
appropriate transformation of training is a key policy objective. Last but not least, support for 
research relevant to the fight against climate change in post-graduate and doctoral programs 
should be promoted. 
 
4.5.2. Public participation, public access to information and social consciousness  
In addition to education and training, there is also a need to increase the general 
awareness of the society. Article 12 of the Paris Agreement prescribes that “The Parties 
shall cooperate, as appropriate, in supporting measures to promote [...] public awareness of 
climate  change,  public  participation  and  public  access  to  information,  recognizing  the 
importance of these steps with respect to enhancing the actions set out in the Agreement. " 
Therefore, in addition to the Preamble, the Agreement confirms the key role of these areas in 
a separate operational provision as well. 
Hungary is a party to the Aarhus Convention39, which also legally guarantees the “right of the 
public to have access to information, to participate in decision-making and to access justice in

environmental matters”.40 This has a special role in the climate-neutral economic and social 
transition in all aspects. First and foremost, society needs to be informed about the most up-
to-date scientifically based information available on possible global and local environmental 
problems,  challenges  and  solutions.  The  collection  and  wide  distribution  of  these  data, 
tailored to the needs of the target audience, should be facilitated by the state. Only a well-
informed  society  can  be  expected  to  make  conscious  decisions  and  take  environmental 
considerations into account than before. This process will also strengthen social support for 
action on climate change by providing rational and publicly sound arguments in support of, 
inter alia, the proposals set out in this strategy. 
NCCS-2 deals with the main directions of action on climate awareness and partnership 
in a separate chapter. These include horizontal integration, the implementation of NCCS-2 
in public administration and partnerships with the media and churches as well as complex 
campaigns  for  climate  awareness  and  network  building  with  the  involvement  of 
governmental, economic, civil, scientific and church actors. These, as well as the activities 
described in Chapter 7 of the NCDS, all contribute to the complex process of information 
transfer and sharing. In addition to the above, the tasks to be performed separately by the 
state in order to achieve the above goals are: 
  Preparing or supporting the preparation of reports and other awareness-raising documents 
on climate change or other environmental issues and making them as widely available as 
possible to the public, 
  Providing "one-stop-shop" information services for green economic transition programs 
or other measures initiated by the Government or other state bodies, involving the public 
and a wide range economic actor, 
  Initiating, continuing and promoting information campaigns, events, dedicated days on 
environmental issues that can reach the general public as well as establishing restrictive 
regulations  on  information  intended  for  public  disclosure  that  is  unsustainable  or 
otherwise harmful to the environment, 
  Establishing and maintaining partnerships, in particular with non-state actors and other 
non-governmental  organizations,  as  well  as  churches,  in  order  to  communicate 
information more effectively, 
  Priority support for local information sharing and awareness raising initiatives, 
  Using most communication channels, including state-of-the-art forms of communication, 
capable  of  conveying  short,  creative,  easy-to-understand  messages,  involving  highly 
publicly recognized, credible actors who can easily reach large masses. 
 
4.5.3. Full participation and cooperation of all levels of government and stakeholders  
The climate-neutral transition requires the active participation and constructive cooperation 
of all actors. For the vast majority of the Hungarian society, climate change is a significant 
issue. A good example of this is that more than two hundred thousand people completed the 
questionnaire  related  the  NCDS  published  by  the  Government  in  November  2019.41  A

  91      
 
recently published study showed that the Hungarian society is particularly concerned about 
the security consequences of climate change.42 This concern should be translated into positive 
action, in which the state has a key initiating and organizing role. The forums in Chapter 7, 
organized by the current government, provide a permanent platform for consultation between 
a wide variety of groups. 
 
4.5.4. Sustainable lifestyles and sustainable consumptions and production patterns   
From the climate-neutral transition perspective, there are huge reserves in the production or 
other business policy decisions made by individual members of the society and economic 
actors. With the current energy-intensive and often wasteful way of life and production, a 
climate-neutral operation is not, or it is much more difficult and costly to  achieve and 
maintain. Mass demand for consciously sustainable products and services is driving supply in 
this  direction.  Vice  versa,  a  “green”  favorable  supply  creates  demand  for  more 
environmentally sustainable products and services. Therefore, supporting and promoting both 
is a priority. 
Changing  current  lifestyles  in  a  more  favorable  direction,  and  only  developing 
behaviors that seek to meet our needs, is the biggest contribution to the fight against 
climate change that individuals can make. The greenest energy is the unused energy. At 
the same time, a supportive regulatory environment that promotes and provides incentives for 
more  sustainable  lifestyles  and  production  is  essential  for  well-informed  decisions  by 
individuals and economic actors. 
5. Financing Climate Neutral Transition and its Economic Policy Instruments  
Vision: "The flow of financial resources is in line with the financing needs of domestic green 
and climate action investments."43 
 
Adequate financing of the climate-neutral transition is critical in tackling global climate 
change. This is confirmed by Article 2 (1) (c) of the Paris Agreement, which states that one 
of the main objectives of the Agreement is to make “finance flows consistent with a pathway 
towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.”  Based on the EA 
scenario, which generates several benefits in the long run, the climate neutral transformation 
of the Hungarian national economy would require about HUF 23.8 billion, which assumes the 
involvement of resources equivalent to 4.8% of GDP per year by 2050. In order to make this 
amount  available  from  public  and  private  sources,  this  long-term  concept  proposes  
appropriate funding instruments and mechanisms. 
Some of the presented proposals have been included in this chapter of the Strategy after 
consultation with representatives of the financial market and other financial organizations44. 
Investments  aimed  at  reducing  CO   emissions  are  capital-intensive,  so  it  is  justified  to

increase  the  bankability  of  investments  with  loans  and  state  subsidies  (e.g.  repayable 
subsidies, interest rate subsidies, loan guarantees). The financial conditions for a climate-
neutral transition must be created jointly by the private and public sectors, as investment 
depends not only on banks' willingness to finance, but also on a stable, transparent and 
predictable political and economic environment. 
Several proposals have addressed the importance and role of green bond issuance as an 
effective  tool  for  dedicated  fundraising.  Mainstreaming  environmental,  social,  and 
governance  (ESG)  principles,  promoting  a  green  mortgage  market,  applying  the  EU 
sustainable investment taxonomy, energy efficiency requirements and green bonds all 
have a positive impact on the development of green projects and interventions. The Strategy 
took into account the proposals for the establishment of a state green guarantee institution, 
which  would  strengthen  the  market  balance  by  reducing  the  competitive  advantage  of 
unsustainable  investments.  Stakeholders  also  support  the  spread  of  Energy  Services 
Companies (ESCO)-type bank financing in the context of municipalities and companies. 
The detailed development and follow-up of these proposals is the responsibility of the Green 
Finance Working Group comprising of key public, banking and other financial market actors, 
presented in Chapter 7. 
 
5.1. Transforming economic policy for a climate neutral transition  
In addition to the development of the domestic capital market and the financial sector in 
general, the climate-neutral transition requires a governmental economic policy that promotes 
low-carbon growth. Each of the individual economic and regulatory functions of the state can 
contribute to this, with sustainability in mind, as follows. 
Through the “greening” of its allocation function, the state ensures the full use of resources 
among private and social goods by enforcing environmental and sustainability considerations 
in the process. This means preventing social and environmental harm caused by market 
failures through fiscal policy in such a way that a healthy environment, energy and resource 
efficiency become an important part of social goods, i.e. the process of allocating resources is 
also influenced by green criteria. 
The aim of “greening” the redistribution function is to motivate income redistribution not 
only to alleviate income inequalities but also to reduce negative environmental impacts. The 
reform of the taxation system and public transfers should be done in a way that supports 
environmentally  sustainable  consumption  and  technological  innovation,  while  over-
consumption and environmentally harmful activities are sanctioned by additional taxes. 
The “green” stabilization function aims to smooth out fluctuations in employment, inflation 
and GDP in order to promote clean and green economic development. Through this function, 
the state can direct labor force towards green and clean jobs, support domestic companies 
developing high value-added, innovative clean technologies and services, i.e. respond to the 
economic challenges arising from phasing out carbon and the green transition, while using 
the inherent economic potential of the process. 
By “greening” the regulatory function of the state, it shapes fiscal policy and the regulation 
of the money, capital and insurance markets in such a way that climate protection and 
environmental sustainability are given a prominent role, among other fiscal aspects. 
In addition, climate-friendly fiscal and economic policies have the overall task of creating a 
growth-friendly  environment  that  supports  the  development  and  innovation  of  clean 
technologies and generates social, environmental and economic benefits. It is also important 
  93      
 
that this supportive environment also helps to take advantage of new business and foreign 
trade opportunities arising from technological developments in order to create high-quality, 
sustainable jobs and increase the competitiveness of companies. 
5.1.1 Climate friendly budget planning   
Climate-friendly, green fiscal policy is an essential tool for achieving environmental and 
climate goals.45 Green budgeting aims to align the country’s expenditures and revenues with 
climate  and  other  environmental  goals.  This  requires  designing  both  the  revenue  and 
expenditure side from a different perspective. On the revenue side, the taxation system is a 
crucial  budgetary  tool  for  “correcting”  the  prices  of  activities  that  generate  negative 
externalities, such as CO emissions and pollution. An important aspect is that green budget 
2 
planning builds on the country’s existing public finance management framework and thus 
aligns with the strengths and constraints of existing fiscal processes. 
Effective green budgeting consists of four mutually reinforcing key components46:  
1) Strong strategic framework: the Government aligns the objectives of environmental and 
climate strategies with decisions on tax policy (e.g., green taxation), state aid (phase out of 
fossil fuel subsidies) and public spending (e.g., green public procurement). 
2)  Tools  for  justification  and  coherence  of  green  budget  measures/decisions:  Green 
budget tools provide evidence of how certain budget measures/decisions affect environmental 
and climate goals. These tools can be: 
a)  Green  budget  labeling47:  classification  of  budgetary  measures  according  to  their 
environmental and/or climate impact. 
b)  Environmental impact assessment: carry out environmental impact assessments for 
new budgetary measures. 
c)  Ecosystems valuation and pricing of environmental externalities, such as the price of 
greenhouse gas emissions, through taxes and emissions trading schemes. 
d)  Green  review  of  expenditure:  taking  into  account  the  impact  of  expenditure  on 
environmental and climate objectives. 
e)  Green  performance  requirements:  aligning  budgetary  performance  requirements 
targets with environmental and climate objectives. 
3) Green reporting for accountability and transparency: The Government submits a green 
budget  report  accompanying  the  annual  budget  to  the  Parliament,  which  provides  a 
comprehensive picture of how the budget is aligned with the green objectives in the given 
budget year. 
4) Governance and implementation of green budgeting: The implementation of green 
budgeting is based on strong political leadership, clearly defined roles and responsibilities 
within the government, a well-designed sequence of implementation, appropriate internal 
systems, and continuous improvement of the skills and expertise of government officials.

5.2. Financial and investment needs of climate neutrality  
As revealed in Chapter 4, achieving a climate-neutral transition by 2050 will require a total of 
approximately HUF 24.7 billion in additional investment in all emitting sectors compared to 
the BAU scenario, which will require the mobilization of resources equivalent to 4.8% of 
GDP per year until the target date. It is important to note, however, that mobilizing this huge 
amount should not only burden Hungary's national budget, but also - as discussed in this 
subchapter - give priority to the involvement of financial and capital markets, EU funds and 
blended financing of public and private funds. This is because market-based and blended 
financing allows limited taxpayer resources to be used for leverage to mobilize 10 or even 20 
times of the amount being invested. 
The costs of investments to be made over the period up to 2050 are distributed between the 
sectors as follows: 
-  Decarbonization of the energy sector, including the energy efficiency modernization 
of buildings, improvement of electricity infrastructure, increase the efficiency in the 
service sector and electrification of the transport sector: HUF 22.4 billion 
-  Investments related to the reduction of emissions from agriculture, including animal 
husbandry, crop production and soil cultivation: HUF 745 billion 
-  Development  of  the  waste  management  sector  and  promotion  of  the  circular 
economy: HUF 480 billion 
-  Modernization of industrial production processes, increase of production efficiency: 
HUF 129 billion 
-  Increasing the CO  sequestration capacity of the LULUCF sector: HUF 964 billion.

Table 11 also provides information on how investment costs will change over the period of 
2020-2030. 
 
5.3. The role of the financial sector in the green transition  
In the double grip of the health and financial crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
transition to a green economy opens up new types of investment opportunities, but also 
imposes financing needs comparable to the post-World War II reconstruction48. The role and 
importance of the financial sector is shown by the fact that it would not be impossible to 
finance this investment need from public funds only, given the budgetary constraints of 
national economies. Thus, it is absolutely necessary for the private sector, and especially 
financial institutions, to channel more capital towards green developments and investments 
than at present. 
 
5.3.1. The need to develop domestic financial markets49  
Based on international experience, there is a huge potential for mobilizing capital markets, 
especially because the typically longer maturity of capital market instruments fits well with

the typically longer payback period of green investments. That is why the NCDS’s funding 
pillar consists of a strong capital market package as follows: 
 
a) Development of a National Sustainable Capital Market Strategy: Within the framework of 
the European Union Structural Reform Support Service and with the participation of the 
European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD)  and  the  Central  Bank  of 
Hungary  (CBH),  investment  service  providers,  investors  and  other  market  participants, 
ministries and all other relevant stakeholders a project promoting the “greening” of  the 
domestic capital market was launched in Hungary. The aim of the comprehensive initiative is 
to  enable the capital  market  to  finance investments in  environmental sustainability to  a 
greater extent than at present, and for "green" companies to have access to more favorable 
capital or bond-type resources. 
 
b) Green bonds: In June 2020, the Hungarian government issued first green government 
securities worth EUR 1.5 billion in the European market and then JPY 20 billion in the 
Japanese market, raising dedicated funds for government investments related to Hungary's 
climate and environmental goals. The aim is to support the start-up of domestic corporate, 
bank or even municipal green bond issuances – in accordance with Act CXCIV of 2011 on 
the economic stability of Hungary - and the strengthening of venture capital to finance 
climate-friendly innovations, accompanied by various regulatory incentives. 
 
c) Green investment and venture capital funds, “greening” of fund portfolios: At present, 
investment funds and funds with domestic sustainability themes can essentially only buy 
foreign green assets into their portfolios, and thus retail green investments also flow abroad. 
The emergence of domestic green bonds and the development of the ESG rating of listed 
companies  could  change  this  situation  in  such  a  way  that  it  also  contributes  to  the 
development of investment funds. It is a positive trend that domestic fund managers have 
moved towards ESG-based portfolio management practices50. Strengthening venture capital 
is also a goal to finance climate-friendly innovations. 
 
d) Sustainable Stock Exchange: The Budapest Stock Exchange joined the Association of 
Sustainable Stock Exchanges in 2019 and is committed to encourage stock market issuers 
towards sustainability. If the climate and other environmental performance data of large 
domestic listed companies become more transparent, then the green assessment of companies 
will  also  become  possible,  thus  further  helping  the  desired  green  capital  flow.  The 
Sustainable Exchange Initiative, in collaboration with investors, regulators and companies, 
can improve sustainability and ESG considerations for investments. 
 
5.3.2. Financing instruments in specific sectors  
 
a) Support for energy efficiency modernization of residential buildings  
Promoting  the  energy  efficiency  renovation  of  residential  buildings  is  a  national 
economic interest, given that this type of investment has not only one of the greatest GHG 
saving potential (see Chapter 4.), but is also capable of creating large number of jobs on a

lasting  basis.  In  addition,  they  provide  significant  health  benefits.51  Building  on  the 
experience  of  previous  energy  efficiency  loan  schemes,  the  aim  is  to  develop  a 
comprehensive  state  support  system  (repayable  grants,  interest  rate  subsidies  and  loan 
guarantees)  based  on  the  competitive  and  flexible  framework  of  commercial  banks. 
Therefore, a joint  “package” of several  measures is  needed to  ensure adequate funding 
sources as follows: (1) CBH announced a capital requirement discount for green housing 
loans,  thus  increasing  banks'  interest  in  such  loans52;  (2)  this  measure  should  be 
complemented by a comprehensive support structure mobilizing private resources (such as 
repayable, non-repayable grants and interest rate subsidies) for renovation loans, and (3) the 
introduction of a loan guarantee scheme to reduce credit risks. 
 
b) Launch of the green mortgage bond market 
Green  mortgage  bonds  are  a  targeted  source  of  funding  for  banks  to  finance  the 
construction and purchase of energy-efficient properties through loans, thus contributing to 
the energy modernization of the building stock. In the case of green mortgage bonds, the 
issuer undertakes to have at least the same amount of green mortgage loan in the loan 
portfolio as the collateral for the mortgage bonds during the term of the bond. This may 
encourage lenders to prefer such mortgages, which may even lead up to more favorable 
interest  rates.  To  date,  banks  in  five  European  countries  (Germany,  Norway,  Sweden, 
Denmark and Poland) have issued green mortgage bonds. 
 
c) Support for other energy efficiency investments, introduction of the energy efficiency 
obligation scheme 
Hungary will ensure the cost-effective implementation of the goals undertaken in the field of 
energy  savings  and  energy  efficiency  by  introducing  an  energy  efficiency  obligation 
scheme. The scheme will include a number of measures to encourage energy efficiency 
renovation. The obligors are service providers engaged in the retail sale of gas, electricity and 
motor fuels, commercial enterprises, universal service providers of gas and electricity. Under 
the scheme, obligors implement interventions that result in energy savings for end users. This 
can be done in a number of ways: through investments in energy efficiency or through 
contributions. 
For the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030, each year, new savings of 0.8% of 
annual final energy consumption must be achieved over the average of the last three years 
preceding 1 January 2019. 
 
d) Support for renewable energy production 
On 1 January 2017, the system for the support of electricity produced from renewable 
energy  sources  (METÁR)  came  into  force.  In  the  METÁR  system,  support  for  new 
investments  can  currently  only  be  applied  for  in  the  form  of  a  green  premium-type 
entitlement  awarded  within  the  framework  of  a  tender  procedure.  In  the  tenders,  the 
producers compete on the basis of their bids for the subsidized price, for a subsidy amounting

to HUF 2.5 billion per year. In the premium system, the producer sells the electricity and 
receives the subsidy above the market reference price. 
According to the Government's plans, following the two tenders so far, a total of four new 
METÁR tenders are expected to be announced by August 2022. According to the plans, new 
calls  will  be  issued  by  the  Hungarian  Energy  and  Public  Utility  Regulatory  Authority 
(MEKH) every six months, to support the production of renewable energy between 300-500 
GWh per year per tender. In order to boost investments, the aim is to facilitate METÁR's 
bank financing with support measures that (i) reduce interest rate and exchange rate risk (e.g., 
subsidized, fixed-rate credit facilities, subsidized interest rate/hedging framework), or (ii) 
reduce credit risks and refinancing risks (e.g., with the loan guarantee institution) and thereby 
easing expectations regarding funding maturity and debt service ratios. 
 
e) Launch of municipality level green funding 
The borrowing of municipalities is currently subject to an ad hoc government permit in 
accordance with Act CXCIV of 2011 on the Economic Stability of Hungary. In compliance 
with  the  law,  numerous  municipal  green  development  projects  (development  of  public 
transport,  waste  management,  water  management,  renovation  of  municipal  buildings, 
renewable energy production, etc.) that provide a well-calculated return may be possible with 
a municipal green loan program and green bond issuance, following the creation of a legal 
environment conducive to financing. 
  
f) Launch of the domestic voluntary carbon offset market 
Carbon  markets  offer  a  cost-effective  opportunity  to  reduce  emissions.  The  voluntary 
carbon market is gaining ground, focusing on synergies with financial and capital markets: 
for example, some banks are actively supporting their own carbon-offsetting customers to sell 
their capacities to GHG emitting companies. Large companies outside the EU ETS may 
become  increasingly  interested  in  offsetting  their  own  GHG  emissions,  even  without  a 
specific regulatory obligation or incentive. However, ensuring market integrity requires the 
involvement of reliable carbon credit rating agencies and/or government involvement in 
credit validation. 
 
Sector  Areas of intervention  Proposals and interventions to be examined 
Energy  Energy efficiency of    Providing capital requirement discount for credit institutions 
residential buildings  for green housing loans 
  Providing complex support programs that mobilize private 
sector sources (such as grants and interest rate subsidies) 
  Introducing a loan guarantee program to reduce credit risk 
expectations 
  Launching a market for green mortgage bonds 
Other energy efficiency    Supporting the spread of ESCO-type financing. Possible 
investments, energy  combined  financing  structures  are  included  in  the 
efficiency obligation  framework  of  the  Energy  Efficiency  Obligation  Scheme 
scheme 
under development. 
  Reducing  the cost of capital and the risk premium in the 
case of ESCO schemes by extending CBH's green capital 
requirement discount. 
  Reduction  the cost of capital and the risk premium through 
state-subsidized programs 
  Reducing  the cost of capital and the risk premium in the 
  98      
 
case of “normal” bank loans with a guarantee institution 
(e.g.,  in  the  case  of  universal  consumers/consumer 
portfolios with weaker financial strength). 
  In connection with energy efficiency financing, supporting 
and encouraging basically market-based lending with fiscal 
concessions (e.g., from EU funds). 
Renewable energy    Strengthening capital market financing: increase the supply 
production  side of renewable energy sources by strengthening capital 
market financing. In addition to the securitization of bank 
loans  and  the  issuance  of  green  bonds,  the  goal  is  to 
introduce and launch renewable investment funds in order 
to provide Hungarian energy retail savers and companies 
with  a  predictable  and  climate-conscious  investment 
opportunity. 
  Supporting  bank  lending:  examining  development 
opportunities in areas such as credit, exchange rate and 
interest rate risk, cost of funds, collateral, rating models, as 
well as new forms of financing and construction. 
  Introducing  of  innovative  solutions:  There  are  many 
innovative  solutions  abroad  in  the  field  of  financing 
renewable energy generation, several of which are relevant 
and applicable in Hungary: roof leasing can be mentioned 
as an example. In this construction, the properly oriented, 
parametric  roof  surfaces  are  leased  by  the  company 
installing  the  solar  panels  and  the  energy  produced  in 
addition  to  satisfying  the  energy  consumption  of  the 
building is sold. 
  Energy  community:  Local  energy  communities  are  a 
specific form of aggregation based on renewable energy 
production. They help to ensure that the energy produced 
can be used locally (e.g., within a transformer area) and that 
fluctuations in production do not burden the distribution 
network. 
Transport   Urban public transport    To be examined how to mobilize private resources for urban 
development  and suburban public transport developments. This includes 
an examination of targeted municipal green bond issuance, 
taxing land value gains, and special bank loans. 
Agriculture      To be examined: the sustainability of Hungarian agricultural 
and food enterprises, the incentives and motivations needed 
to  become  sustainable,  the  types  of  sustainability 
investments, the factors influencing the financing decision, 
the special financing needs and the relationship between the 
current credit supply system, compliance with EU taxonomy 
regulations on sustainable investments, reporting and the 
area of agricultural damage mitigation and insurance. 
Circular      To  be  examined:  what  incentives  can  be  introduced  to 
economy  facilitate the financing of circular economic forms, solutions 
and implementations, and to monitor and verify the complex

5.3.3. Climate-neutral transition as a mean of attracting foreign investment  
Attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) is a top priority for the Hungarian Government, 
especially in the field of green industry investments. The Hungarian Investment Promotion 
Agency (HIPA) was established in 2017 with the aim of providing professional assistance to 
foreigners wishing to invest in Hungary. Renewable energy and e-mobility are high on the 
list of investments to attract. 
 
The adopted Climate Protection Act and the clear and ambitious target system set by the 
NCDS, including anchoring incentives for low-emission technologies in all sectors, show a 
strong commitment to a climate-neutral transition, which is an important attraction factor for 
green FDI. Apart from that, the additional financial incentives envisaged in this strategy (tax 
breaks, low-interest loans, etc.) have been shown to provide additional incentives for green 
FDI and thus create local jobs, which would also contribute to significant knowledge transfer. 
 
Hungary has one of the highest share of exports related to high-tech industries in the Central 
and  Eastern  European  region  within  all  exports  (OECD).  This  provides  an  excellent 
opportunity for taking a similar position in the green industry, using this experience and 
network. In Hungary, a highly skilled and competitive workforce is a great precondition for 
realizing high-tech renewable energy or other clean technology investments. 
 
5.4. Possible sources and means of financing the green transition  
The Hungarian financial and capital market is already lending activities that serve Hungary's 
climate and other sustainability goals - primarily in the field of renewable energy production. 
According to a report54 of the Hungarian Banking Association, in 2020 the average maturity 
of climate-related lending was 13 years, the average equity requirement was 28%, while the 
loan portfolio amounted to HUF 172 billion and the additional market demand amounted to 
another HUF 150 billion. It is important to note that market-based lending is essentially 
driven solely by the risk-adjusted expected return on funding and the associated capital and 
operating costs. That is, green lending is currently done on an ad-hoc basis, “brown” (not 
serving environmental sustainability) investments receive financing with a similar chance and 
condition  as  green  projects.  In  the  case  of  non-refundable  state  support  and  funds,  the 
conditions based on the green approach are also rare or soft, with the exception of dedicated 
programs (such as energy efficiency tenders).

The long-term  success  of decarbonisation may depend on the  ability  to  channel capital 
towards  green  projects  through  appropriate  measures.  It  must  therefore  be  ensured  that 
investments  for  environmental  sustainability  and  environmentally  sustainable  economic 
activities consistently face a more favorable financing environment than “non-green” and 
especially  “brown”  investments  and  activities.  This  desirable  state  can  be  achieved  by 
combining  monetary and fiscal policy instruments: 
a) in its own regulatory competence, the CBH “directs” the financial sector in the green 
direction by calibrating prudential regulation, with recommendations and warnings, without 
endangering its main tasks specified in the Central Bank Act; 
(b) the government encourages green financing of banks and capital market participants, as 
well  as  other  market  participants  (companies,  households,  etc.),  through  various  fiscal 
measures; and with the optimal combination of incentives and penalties, it influences the 
realization of the necessary investments in the transition on the demand side. 
It is also important to emphasize that the financial, capital and insurance markets have orders 
of magnitude more resources available than national budgets or EU funds for green purposes. 
5.4.1. Guarantee institutions to promote green financing55  
Positive externalities resulting from building retrofitting are most often not taken into account 
by  financial  market  participants,  i.e.  without  state  incentives,  fewer  socially  optimal 
investments are made. The supply side can be ensured by a state guarantee or an interest rate 
subsidy to a level that can establish a proper market equilibrium. The establishment of a 
dedicated green guarantee institution will ensure a targeted, conscious expansion of green 
funding. The basic multiplier effect of the guarantee is also present here: a unit of guaranteed 
amount allows for a loan of 10 or even 20 times, which can be used to multiply the growth 
rate of green investments. 
The importance of the guarantee institution continues to grow during the downturn caused by 
the  COVID-19  pandemic;  due  to  its  countercyclical  operation  it  is  excellent  for  green 
economic  stimulus,  counterbalancing  banks'  risk-averse  strategies  and  financing  green 
investments of under-collateralised customers. 
As the introduction of an energy efficiency obligation scheme is an important tool in the 
NCDS (in which ESCO-based financing can be a key), the relationship between ESCOs and 
the guarantee institution is as follows: 
  Prospective  public  utility  obligors  of  the  obligation  system  are  typically  more 
creditworthy, have cheaper access to funding than their end-users, but at the same time 
operate with strained liquidity, so the planned cash flow is very important for them. As a 
result, end-user segments where payment delays and non-deliveries occur are not target 
markets for them. By preferring the “best” customers, energy efficiency investments are 
not realized in Hungary to the extent what the market potential would actually allow. 
  The portfolio guarantee, which can also be applied to the ESCO scheme, provides an 
effective solution to this problem. Based on the default rate of the utilities' customers, the 
extent of the guarantee required by the guarantee institution for the entire portfolio can be 
calculated. For example, at a default rate of 5%, a portfolio loss guarantee calibrated on

for the National Clean Development Strategy. July 2020. Budapest.  
 
  101      
 
the basis of expected loss has a twenty-fold multiplier effect, while an energy efficiency 
investment in an ESCO scheme could be implemented for customers who would not 
otherwise have been selected by the obligor without a guarantee incentive. In addition to 
the  general  public,  the  end-user  clientele  also  includes,  for  example,  state-owned 
companies, educational institutions, local governments and hospitals. 
  The portfolio-type guarantee can be used for loans financing the modernization of non-
residential real estate, as well as for household-sized solar collector and PV investments, 
as well as for financing small-scale solar power plants, which are subject to individual, 
lengthy assessment by banks. Bank financing expertise is usually concentrated in project 
lending, however the financing needs of these clients do not reach the entry threshold for 
project lending. 
 
The  following  advantages  justify  the  consideration  of  setting  up  a  Green  Guarantee 
Institution: 
  concentrates green industry expertise within one organization; 
  supports the building of the historical experience of financiers (this could be helped 
by the creation of "green" pilot projects in all industries with the support of the 
guarantee institution); 
  provides free technical and green advice on the investments to be made; 
  provides guarantees not only for loans but even green bonds (by reducing the risk 
premium, the pricing of the funds covered by the green bond can be improved, which 
indirectly improves the return on the financed investments); 
  It also encourages equity placements (such as support for green venture capital funds) 
 
5.4.2 Available European Union funds  
In the EU budget period 2021-2027, Hungary is expected to receive a total of ~ EUR 42 
billion (approximately HUF 14 -15 thousand billion) of EU funding from the 2021-2027 
multi-annual  financial  framework  and  the  Next  Generation  EU  framework,  which 
includes non-refundable and refundable forms of support, but does not include a mandatory 
minimum national co-financing. Of this, the relevant budget for the implementation of this 
Strategy is EUR 30.88 billion in the following composition (excluding Common Agriculture 
Policy support): 
-  Cohesion Fund support:          EUR 21.73  billion, 
-  Non-repayable part of the Recovery Fund:    EUR 7.17   billion, 
-  Just Transition Fund:           EUR 0.25   billion, 
-  Estimated national share of EU direct programs:   EUR 1.73   billion. 
Of this, the minimum amount to be used for climate goals under EU regulations is expected 
to be EUR 8.2 billion. Together with the mandatory minimum national co-financing, HUF 
2.9 billion is available to finance climate investments by 2030. 
Part of the above is the newly established Just Transition Mechanism, which aims to 
support the economic transformation of regions’ sectors that are affected by climate policy 
developments. Although negotiations are still ongoing, Hungary will receive a grant of EUR 
  102      
 
294 million from the Just Transition Fund, which may be complemented by loans from 
Pillars 2 and 3 of the Just Transition Mechanism. 
The framework available to Hungary presented above does not include the subsidies available 
under  the  Common  Agricultural  Policy,  so  the  climate-related  interventions  to  be 
implemented in the field of agriculture do not burden the HUF 4.1 billion envelope. 
The framework, on the other hand, includes sources available from directly EU-managed 
programs, on the assumption that Hungary will be able to increase the amount of national 
support it has received over the period 2014-2020. Programs under direct EU management 
will be available to finance energy and climate protection projects with increased funding for 
the  period  2021-2027,  such  as  Horizon  Europe  (RDI),  the  Connecting  Europe  Facility 
(energy infrastructure), LIFE (environment, climate policy), Digital Europe (digitalization), 
InvestEU (efficient transport infrastructure, green energy and innovation) and the Innovation 
Fund (innovative carbon-free technologies, CCUS, innovative renewable energy production, 
energy storage). 
In the third trading period of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (2013-2020), a certain 
proportion of the revenues from the sale of allowances (50% of European Union Allowance 
(EUA) III unit sales, 100% of EUAA aviation unit sales) will be used in the appropriations 
managed by the Green Economy Financing Scheme. Between 2021 and 2030, assuming an 
average CO  price of EUR 25 per ton, a quota revenue of approximately HUF 910 
2
billion56 can be planned. Of this, HUF 726 billion will be available according to the general 
rules of quota revenues57, i.e. 50% (HUF 363 billion) will be used for green economy 
development purposes. 
The  part  of  the  quota  revenues  for  the  development  of  the  green  economy  is 
supplemented by the resources of the Modernization Fund58 in the amount of HUF 184 
billion: Hungary will be entitled to these in excess of the amounts used according to the 
general rules of current quota revenues. The Modernization Fund, which has been in place 
since 2021, aims to modernize energy systems and increase energy efficiency. At least 
70% of the available financial resources must be used to support investments that meet the 
priority list of the Modernization Fund. For the remaining 30% of the funds, other projects 
related to the modernization of the energy system may be supported. For projects on the 
priority list, the aid intensity may not exceed 100%, otherwise up to 70%. The priority list 
that can be revised in 2024 includes the following elements: 
  production and use of electricity from renewable sources; 
  improving energy efficiency in all sectors; 
  energy storage; 
  modernization of energy  networks, including  district  heating lines  and electricity 
networks; 
  expanding connections between Member States; 
                                                 
56 The estimation of revenues is subject to considerable uncertainty, as the price of allowances is traded on the 
stock exchange and is also affected by the functioning of the market stability reserve, the need for free allocation 
and certain political factors (e.g., Brexit). Therefore, the figure can only be considered as an indicative estimate.

The domestic application of derogation 10c between 2021 and 2030 is intended to replace 
electricity generation with high greenhouse gas emissions with natural gas or sustainable 
technologies. The aid intensity may not exceed 70%. The winning projects will be selected 
through a call for proposals. 
In total, between 2021 and 2030, the amount of EU funds available to Hungary to finance 
the green transition and the achievement of climate goals may exceed HUF 3 500 billion.

6. Research, Development and Innovation 
Achieving  climate  neutrality  requires  a  long-term  reduction  in  GHG  emissions  and  an 
increase in sink capacities at a rate which is currently not possible with existing technologies, 
or achievable at excessive costs, or only feasible with radical lifestyle changes that are 
disproportionate to the pursued goal. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), 
nearly 45% of the emission reductions will be carried out by technologies that are currently in 
the development phase (characterized by the first four stages of the TRL scale59 including 
basic and applied research phases). For that matter, RDI are crucial to achieving our energy 
and climate goals. Furthermore, the reduction in cost induced by RDI will significantly 
promote the expansion of new technologies.  
6.1. Innovative technologies and solutions  
In the future, the multiplication of mitigation and adaptation technologies will need to be 
promoted since only one technology or alternative fuel will not be enough to decarbonize our 
economy and adapt to the negative impacts of climate change. Therefore, the successful 
outcome depends on the availability of technologies and alternative fuels as well as on the 
right combination of the possible solutions.  
6.1.1. Value chain maturity of critical energy technologies 
According to the IEA, the full decarbonization depends primarily on the value chain maturity 
of electrification, hydrogen (and its derivatives), bioenergy as well as of CCUS technologies 
that ensure the capture, storage and utilization of CO . Therefore, the scaling up of currently 
2
available clean technologies as well as the emergence of new technologies and their market 
application should be supported.  
Independent modelling results point out that achieving net zero emissions will bring along 
extensive electrification. According to the IEA, in order to reach global climate neutrality by 
2050,  electricity  production  should  be  increased  about  2.5  times  by  mid-century.  This 
demand should be covered by clean, carbon free (renewable and nuclear) sources. Based on 
the EA scenario, electricity production in Hungary will be around 3 times of the current level 
by 2050. 
Achieving climate neutrality requires a radical change in the methods of energy supply, 
transformation and consumption. Furthermore, the integration of energy capacities is a key 
task which demands a smarter, more resilient and flexible electricity network that can adopt 
to necessary weather-dependent capacities.  
It is essential to extend renewable energy sources as well as nuclear capacities to achieve the 
climate neutrality target. In the field of nuclear power, further efforts need to be made to 
reach the necessary levels.  
Renewable energy generation fundamentally depends on the availability of renewable energy 
sources and the readiness of the electricity network. In Hungary, solar energy is the most 
potential source for renewable energy generation. In the field of photovoltaic technology, 
alongside  other  variable  /  weather-dependent  renewable  technologies,  there  has  been  a 
                                                 
59 The maturity of technologies under development is characterized by Technology Readiness Levels (TRL). 
This method was developed by NASA originally identifying levels from 1-9. The IEA extended this scale to 11 
levels that includes the most mature technologies in the list.  Levels 1-4 characterize technologies in the 
preliminary phases of research and development (basic and applied research), while Levels 5-8 identify system 
models or prototype demonstration in a relevant operational environment. Level 9-10 stand for proved solutions 
and technologies ready for commercial deployment. Level 11 corresponds to the most mature technologies.   
  105      
 
significant progress in the past decade. Many technologies have reached the level of early 
application and have become more cost  efficient  which contributes to the expansion of 
renewable energy capacities. 
Renewable energies rapidly shape global energy production systems. According to data from the International 
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), renewable capacities accounted for 72% of the total new capacities in 
2019.  
The price of electricity produced by renewable sources has dynamically decreased in the past decade due to 
technology developments, economies of scale and the increasingly competitive supply chains. Based on recent 
IRENA data, between 2010 and 2019, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for the operating time of utility-
sized solar panels decreased by 82%. In the case of concentrated solar panels (CSP) it decreased by 47% in the 
same period. 
Although, further innovation needs can be identified related to renewable energy production, 
the  network  and  end-user  sides  require  serious  efforts  in  order  to  fully  exploit  the 
opportunities  of  renewables.  We  could  witness  a  significant  progress  at  the  level  of 
transmission and distribution networks as well as on the end-user side. For instance, ultra-
high voltage (UHV) transmission, Li-ion battery energy storage, e-mobility and heat pumps 
reached the early application stage. In the meantime, digitalization and artificial intelligence 
are expanding in  the energy sector as well. However, further efforts  will be needed to 
improve innovative system integration and end-user side developments.  
Many  technologies  carry  future  perspectives,  yet  significant  uncertainties  remain.  For 
example,  smart  inverters,  compressed-air  energy  storage    solutions  and  fast  charging 
technologies are already in the demonstration phase and their success depends on further 
innovation  efforts.  The  future  vision  of  applicability  is  uncertain  for  solutions  that  are 
currently at a conceptual phase (basic or laboratory-applied research) or prototype level. This 
especially concerns demand-side areas such as the heavy industry (e.g. steel production, 
cement industry) and long-distance travels (mainly aviation and maritime travel). In this case, 
electrification would be hard or too expensive to introduce which perhaps requires different 
solutions in these areas. (Table 13)

  107      
 
Although  zero-carbon  electricity  consumption  strongly  contributes  to  climate  neutrality 
targets, electricity alone will not be able to decarbonize the whole economy. In parallel with 
expanding electrification technologies, introducing other solutions to the market should be 
accelerated as well. Among other things, CCUS technologies will be of key importance in 
the future. Since Hungary has limited capacities to store carbon, the utilization of captured 
CO should be primarily in focus when applying CCUS technologies.  
2  
CCUS might join the wide range of available low-carbon alternatives in the decarbonization 
of energy production which would contribute to the zero-carbon transition of fossil fuel 
power plants (natural gas or biomass powered). Furthermore, CCUS technologies can be key 
in the future production of natural-gas based low-carbon hydrogen (blue hydrogen) and in 
industrial production (mainly in cement, iron, steel and chemical production).  
Direct air capture60 – that can be considered as a special form of CCUS – can result in 
negative  emissions  which  can  compensate  emissions  from  sectors  that  are  hard  to 
decarbonize (such as aviation, heavy industry or agriculture). Direct air capture is currently 
very expensive, therefore this technology sooner or later needs to be applied in a large-scale 
to reduce its costs.  
A key question is whether these energy technologies will be available in time for all phases of 
the process. The maturity level of technologies for capturing, transferring, utilizing and 
storing CO  emissions is significantly different (Table 14). 
2
While CO -capture has been present in certain industrial and  fuel-transformation processes, such as in 
2
ammonia production (chemical absorption), in other fields it has only started to appear on a commercial scale 
(ammonia production with physical absorption). Also, there are technologies still in the demonstration phase 
(e.g. methanol production with chemical or physical absorption; cement production with chemical absorption) 
or at the prototype level (ammonia production with physical absorption; ethanol production from lignocellulose 
by CCUS technology).  
The pipeline technology needed for CO  transport can be considered as a mature technology. However, 
2
transportation technologies on water (mainly maritime) are still at the prototype or demonstration level.  
CO has been used in oil mining for more than five decades and the used CO can be stored in oil reservoirs. 
2  2   
Storage in underground saline formations is in the early application phase. In the case of other geological 
storage options (e.g. in depleted oil and gas fields), we have only limited experience for now.  
CO -utilization is only present in a few sectors, such as urea production and manufacture of carbonated 
2
drinks.61 In the future, CO can possibly be used in construction (within building material) and synthetic fuel 
2 
production. 
To  successfully  apply  carbon  capture  and  storage,  further  research,  innovation  and 
demonstration efforts are needed.

Table 14 – Technology readiness of the CCUS value chain 
Innovative technologies based on hydrogen and synthetic fuels (produced from hydrogen) 
as secondary energy carriers as well as fuel cells as energy source are globally highlighted 
key areas. These solutions might have a significant role in future sustainable energy systems 
and mobility as well as in greening sectors that are hard to decarbonize (chemical industry, 
steel  production,  cement  industry).  This  is  confirmed  at  the  EU-level  by  the  Hydrogen 
Strategy published as a communication by the European Commission in July 2020 and it will 
also  be  supported  by  Hungary’s  forthcoming  National  Hydrogen  Strategy.  Numerous 
technologies are needed to produce, transport, store and utilize low-carbon or carbon free 
hydrogen. These are usually in different phases of the learning curve and are facing their own 
particular technological challenges. (Table 15) 
Improving pathways to produce low-carbon or carbon free hydrogen as well as laying the 
foundations of the hydrogen market are critically important. Linking traditional technologies 
(mainly  natural  gas  steam  reforming)  with  CCUS  and  electrolysis  (using  electricity  to 
decompose water) are the two new main production processes. The former can be a mid-term 
solution while the latter can serve as a good alternative on the long-run – by establishing the 
carbon-free energy mix. In the case of electrolysis, there are several different processes

known. Alkaline electrolysis technologies are the most mature and therefore the most cost-
efficient solutions that dominate the market, especially in the case of large-scale projects. 
While other new projects are based on polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis or 
solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technologies.

The National Hydrogen Technology Platform and launching the development of the national hydrogen 
strategy 
The National Energy Strategy, adopted in the beginning of 2020, also addressed the future role of hydrogen. 
The National Hydrogen Technology Platform, established in April 2020, can give a serious momentum to the 
development of the Hungarian hydrogen economy since it brings relevant actors to the table. It also creates a 
forum to establish the incentivizing and regulatory tools based on professional consensus in the focus areas 
relevant to the Hungarian economy and science. The Platform is aiming to elaborate a white book that maps the 
domestic situation of the application of hydrogen technologies, the available competencies as well as the 
expectations and plans of the actors in the sector. The National Hydrogen Strategy will be based on this white 
book. In order to achieve sectoral progress in this field, it is important to initiate concrete projects beyond the 
general strategic frameworks. 
The large-scale and sustainable utilization of bioenergy – within that, primarily „modern” 
procedures – will be essential to achieve climate targets. The already mature or almost mature 
  110      
 
technologies  to  utilize  bionenergy  include  the  production  of  first  generation  (advanced) 
biofuels as well as powering biomass plants and special heaters (Table 16). 
Harvesting the long-term potential of bioenergy depends on the development and expansion 
of several  new technologies at  early readiness levels.  These solutions  include advanced 
(second generation) biodiesel, cellulosic bioethanol production, biomethane production in 
anaerobic digestion plants, biomass CCUS as well as using biofuels in aviation and maritime 
transport. However, the cost of raw material and logistical difficulties can limit harvesting the 
opportunities, hence further innovative solutions are needed to develop and strengthen the 
biomass supply chain.

Exploiting the potential of biogas holds serious innovation opportunities in Hungary. Biogas 
not only would moderate natural gas imports in the foreseeable future, but investments could 
support job creation and economy stimulation purposes.   
6.1.2. Clean technologies and solutions in other sectors 
This  sub-chapter  provides  a  non-exhaustive  overview  of  clean  innovative  alternative 
solutions that are already known for Hungary in the field of water, waste and wastewater 
  111      
 
management, transport, industry, building sector as well as agriculture and forestry (Table 
17). 
In the past decades, technological development has successfully contributed to the efficient 
handling  water  management  issues.  This  is  mainly  due  to  information-,  bio-  and 
nanotechnologies,  different  up-to-date  monitoring  systems  as  well  as  the  water-related 
application  of  different  methodologies  and  modelling  options  that  support  planning  and 
decision-making.  Nevertheless,  it  is  reasonable  to  exploit  the  opportunities  given  by 
technological developments such as to reduce consumption in water-extensive industries and 
the number of pollutants of the discharged waters. Furthermore, water management aspects 
have to be especially taken into account for the electrolysis-based hydrogen production.  
The  wide-spread  application  of  available  clean  and  innovative  waste  management 
technologies  (e.g.  digitalization,  membrane  technology,  artificial  intelligence, 
nanotechnology, plasma technology and modern material technology) as well as establishing 
and operating environmental management systems is a significant progress. These solutions 
can  expand  and  make  waste  management  options  more  efficient  in  the  case  of  waste 
recovery, disposal and prevention.  
There are available innovative wastewater treatment solutions for recycling nutrients into 
the natural cycle as well as for the disposal of sewage sludge on agricultural lands and energy 
utilization.  Exploiting and further improving these technologies are of key importance.   
There is a significant potential in reducing emissions in transport, however ceasing further 
opportunities requires more intensive RDI efforts. Making transport more climate-friendly is 
supported mainly by cleaner fuel consumption (electricity, first generation biofuels, low-
carbon  or  carbon  free  hydrogen),  but  there  is  further  potential  in  advanced  vehicle 
manufacturing as well (material technology, improving production processes). Moreover, the 
optimization of fuel consumption efficiency, a more coordinated transport management as 
well as digitalization and autonomous technologies also hold opportunities.  
Using clean technologies, energy carriers and raw materials in the industry contributes to the  
reduction  of  emissions  in  the  sector  and  increase  energy-,  material-  and  other  resource 
efficiency. In addition to greening and decarbonizing energy consumption, there are many 
other ways to improve sustainability. Such innovations include the use of lightweight and 
long-lasting materials, the use of CCUS technology, the use of alternative raw materials, 
digitalization and automation, robotics, and the improvement of additive manufacturing and 
process efficiency. 
Today, the building sector still consumes a significant amount of resources, especially with 
regard to material and energy consumption. However, with new technologies, significant 
savings can be achieved in the future. More eco-friendly building and insulation materials as 
well as new architectural solutions can reduce the sector's material requirements and energy 
consumption.  Clean  energy  efficiency  technologies  (solar  panels,  heat  pumps),  smart 
solutions  for  more  efficient  energy  use  as  well  as  modern  lighting  and  ventilation 
technologies offer a solution for clean and efficient energy use in the sector. In the longer 
term, there is also great potential for household energy storage solutions. 
Agriculture and forestry must also play a serious role in tackling climate challenges. 
Agriculture – by its nature – needs a multi-dimensional approach since the sector: 
1)  must be able to fulfill the increasing demand for food; 
2)  must reduce its own carbon footprint,  
  112      
 
3)  and it must improve its resilience against extreme weather. 
Possible innovative measures to reduce emissions and improve adaptation to climate change 
in  agriculture  include  e.g.  improving  the  sink  capacity  of  the  soil,  integrated  plant 
management and innovative use of agricultural waste. The rise of precision technologies, 
biotechnology, robotics, drone-based remote sensing or even the expansion of the innovative 
food industry, that helps transforming consumption patterns, can also contribute to making 
the sector more sustainable. 
 
Applying innovative „clean” technologies in the agricultural sector  
  Energy efficiency measures and a larger-scale use of renewable energy will make a major contribution to 
reducing the sector's emissions.  
  Improving agricultural machinery and equipment as well as greater energy efficiency of agricultural 
buildings can reduce fuel consumption and the emissions of pollutants.  
  The capture and storage of carbon in the soil can be enhanced, inter alia, by cultivation technologies that 
convert atmospheric CO  into carbon-based compounds in the soil. 
2
  The use of nitrogen fertilizers involves significant emissions of nitrous oxide (N O), a strong greenhouse 
2
gas. Various techniques promise to reduce these emissions but further innovation is needed to increase 
their efficiency. For example, nitrification inhibitors that can retain nitrogen in the soil for a longer period 
of time in a form that can be used by plants; microbes that allow plants to capture nitrogen63 and the 
production of synthetic fertilizers from renewable energy sources are already known technologies64. N O 
2
emissions can also be reduced by rationalizing the use of nitrogen fertilizers which can be supported by the 
so-called  precision  agriculture  that  applies  advanced  digitalization  technologies  (sensors,  data 
transmission, data analysis) allowing fertilizers to get into the soil in the right time and quantity.  
  Determining the need for irrigation water as accurately as possible is an increasingly common demand 
from the crop production sectors, therefore precision irrigation that brings significant savings is the way 
forward.  
  By remote sensing to yield mapping, it is possible to determine where it is worth applying pesticides or 
manure. Based on the obtained information, more seeds can be applied to good quality soil patches and 
less to worse-quality areas.  
  With the combination of GPS guides and automatic steering, tractors take the smallest possible distance 
which saves fuel and reduces emissions alongside fuel consumption.  
  The efficiency of horticultural greenhouses can be improved with integrated and intelligent systems.  
  Precision feeding promotes efficient animal  husbandry.  Computer-controlled devices  with automatic 
feeders can even allow animals to be fed according to their individual appetite and condition, based on a 
feeding curve.  
  Emissions from animal husbandry (mainly cattle farming) are also significant. Emissions can be reduced 
through innovative technologies such as innovative feed composition, which, among other things, improve 
the digestion of cattle.  
  Anaerobic fermenters can reduce emissions from manure treatment by capturing methane and converting it 
into renewable energy.  
  Food loss and waste must be reduced. In this regard, while consumption patterns need to be transformed, 
the  opportunities offered  by  digitalization  technologies,  that  can  connect  supply  chain  actors  more 
effectively, have to be better exploited. Based on surveys of the „Without leftover” program of the 
National Food Chain Safety Office (NÉBIH), there was a 4% decrease in household food waste between 
2016-2019. A public awareness raising campaign within the frameworks of the project that included a 
                                                 
63 This could replace the use of fertilizers in case of certain plants.

complex school program highly contributed to this reduction.  
  A wider dissemination of meat and dairy product alternatives can reduce emissions. Many innovations 
have already been made in this field, and improvements are continuing. Numerous food companies are 
dedicated to develop and further improve plant-based meat alternatives as well as to elaborate technologies 
to grow meat in laboratories. 
Unfortunately, climate change highly impacts forestry and as such, the sector  has to become 
more innovative in order to face the upcoming challenges successfully. Precision farming 
must become an everyday practice in forestry and foresters need to adopt technologies such 
as remote sensing, advanced monitoring systems, light detection and ranging (LiDAR).

6.2. Framework conditions for innovation 
Although  the  most  important  element  of  innovation  for  energy  and  climate  goals  is 
technological innovation, there is also a need for regulations and policies that encourage 
innovation as well as innovative business models, innovative market design and innovative 
system operation. As a matter of fact, there is a need to pursue a holistic approach that 
emphasizes the importance of interaction between technological and social innovations.  
The role of the state is of utmost importance in the promotion of RDI activities, especially 
related to the private sector.  
The  main  goal  set  by  the  Government  for  the  RDI  sector  is  to  make  the  Hungarian’s 
economy, green and high-tech, as well as resilient and sovereign. This means that as many 
Hungarian-owned companies as possible should be present in the market, producing and 
providing world-class products and services with modern and green technology, ensuring a 
secure livelihood for their employees. Another priority is to increase RDI performance and to 
fully exploit the economic development opportunities created by the innovation needs arising 
from climate change. 
  115      
 
The  New  National  Strategy  for  Research,  Development  and  Innovation  2021-2030  is  a 
horizontal document that establishes a favorable, supportive regulatory environment. This 
document, prior to government decision was based on extensive professional consultation and 
is  the  continuation  of  the  Investing  in  the  Future  -  National  Strategy  for  Research, 
Development and Innovation 2013-2020. The vertical (sectoral) elements are set out in the 
Smart Specialization Strategy (S3) that is yet to be adopted. 
The EU wish to allocate significantly more budget for the fight against climate change while 
providing dedicated support for 'green' RDI activities. The available national RDI resources 
will  also  increase  substantially  in  the  upcoming  years.  This  will  be  beneficial  for  the 
Hungarian economy because according to the findings of a recent evaluation assessing the 
use of RDI subsidies in Hungary, the resources for RDI were utilized more efficiently from 
the point of view of the national economy and the market than the investments made in other 
areas.  Although  the  benefits  of  these  types  of  aid  are  slower  than  others,  they  can  be 
demonstrated and more durable in the long-term. 
To  promote  green  RDI  activities  the  following  main  domestic  strategic  goals  and 
implementations tools have been identified:  
 
 
Strategic objective  Institutions, tools 
Establishing and operating a stable  a) Council of the National Science Policy  
state-owned strategic-financing 
b) National Research, Development and Innovation Office  
institutional system, and maintaining 
of the tender system that encourages  c) Eötvös Loránd Research Network 
RDI activities 
Establishing an efficient and  a) Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (OTKA): to support research 
successful RDI ecosystem  projects  promoting  the  international  recognition  of  Hungarian 
researchers and institutions. 
 
b)  Thematic  Excellence  Program  (TKP):  to  support  92  thematic 
researches of 27 scientific institutions. 
c) University Innovation Ecosystem: independent organizational units 
within  higher  education  institutions  that  promote  the  market 
utilization  and  technology  transfer  of  scientific  results  of  the 
university as well as support RDI cooperation between the university 
and actors of the business sector. 
d) National Laboratories: an internationally recognized, goal-oriented 
network  center  system  that  brings  together  domestic  knowledge 
centers in topics of particular interest to the national economy in four 
main areas of research and development (industry and digitalization; 
culture and family; health and safe society; environment),  
e) Science Parks: to create a market that is based on one thematic 
theme.  These  international  business  hubs  would  create  a  closer 
cooperation between higher education institutions and the business 
sector and they would be attractive for green innovative enterprises 
with a high-value added, a strong job creation potential).

Energy innovation tenders in Hungary  
In March 2020, tenders with an initial budget of HUF 12 billion (which was increased by a further HUF 4 
billion in September 2019) were announced to support energy innovation pilot projects. The financial resources 
were covered by the green economy financing scheme of MIT that is used for allocating the revenues of CO
2 
quotas for climate protection. The main objective of the announced tenders is to support the development of 
innovative solutions and their mass application that promote the domestic use of renewable energies in 
electricity production and in the field of locally available renewable energy sources. The tenders announced in 
this round were:  
  Implementation of developments that ensure the stability and flexibility of electricity networks with 
innovative tools, 
  Pilot projects that support the establishment and operation of energy communities,  
  Implementation of developments that transform zero-carbon, excess electricity to gas energy (hydrogen, 
synthetic methane/biomethane) via innovative technologies,  
  Securing the energy supply for settlements with alternative supply methods that replace natural gas as well 
as with modern technologies and flexibility services. 
 
6.3. Economic development opportunities of clean technology innovation 
The role of RDI is crucial in the identification, development and further improvement of low-
carbon or carbon-free technologies in all GHG-emitting sector. Additionally, it provides new 
solutions for adapting to the negative impacts of climate change as well. Furthermore, the 
RDI sector and new emerging industries that are gaining ground due to RDI offer significant 
potential for job creation and thus for clean economic growth.   
All of the above confirms that RDI activities as well as innovative technologies and solutions 
will not only allow us to successfully decarbonize our energy production, but they will help 
reducing emissions in economic processes as well. They will also contribute to fighting the 
negative impacts of climate change, promote the establishment and expansion of new and 
sustainable sectors which helps building a new, green and climate friendly Hungary with a 
healthier  society.  All  this  can  be  achieved  in  a  way  that  climate  goals  and  economic 
objectives are mutually reinforcing each other.

7. Governance of the Implementation, Monitoring and Revision 
 
7.1. Governance of the implementation 
The adoption and publication of the NCDS is not the end, but rather the beginning of the 
process that should ensure that Hungary is on the right path to achieve the long-term goal of 
becoming climate neutral by 2050. Nevertheless, the NCDS will form part of an already 
existing diverse international, EU-level and national strategic environment (see Annex 2) that 
sets the frameworks and targets of climate action for Hungary. It is important to take into 
account the main goals of the NCDS when updating the NECP, the National Climate Change 
Action Plans and all relevant sectoral strategies.  
Climate change is a highly complex phenomenon with cross-cutting impacts, therefore it 
requires  the  involvement  of  the  widest  and  most  diverse  circle  of 
stakeholders. Informative, coordinational and harmonizing functions  within  the  public 
administration ensure the alignment of different policy areas, avoiding redundant work and 
appointing people in  charge of specific  tasks.  They  will also strengthen  the  cooperation 
among these appointees as well as promote reporting about challenges and achievements. To 
undertake this role, the executive- and expert-level Interministrial Committee on Climate 
Change had been established, which is led by the Deputy State Secretary for climate policy.  
For the successful implementation, all relevant and up-to-date scientific and policy related 
information needs to be gathered.  This knowledge- and information gathering function is 
carried out by an independent scientific institution’s periodical National Climate Change 
Assessment Reports, following the example of the IPCC and other climate-related data-
gathering.  
The  continuous  and  structured  dialogue  with  non-central  governmental 
stakeholders could foster joint action as well as promote informing the public regularly and 
taking their inputs into consideration:  
a.  Specific conciliation forums in every GHG emitting and sink sectors as well as in 
cross-cutting areas consist of governmental and non-governmental stakeholders,  
b.  Green Financial Working Group that is dealing with the financial aspects of the 
implementation,  
c.  County-level Climate Platforms,  
d.  And such government-operated online platforms that ensure the access to up-to-date 
information and provide a possibility for anyone to share their feedback.  
The main  tools  of  the  implementation  of  the  NCDS are documents  that  prescribe 
concrete actions and programs to achieve short- and medium-term goals harmonized with 
long-term objectives, these are mainly  
  the 3-year-period Climate Change Action Plans created for the implementation of the 
current National Climate Change Strategy,  
  and the National Energy and Climate Plans for 10-year periods.  
  118      
 
Furthermore individual policy strategies (for example the strategy aiming to establish the 
hydrogen economy) or other relevant documents are also implementation tools for the long-
term goals of the NCDS. 
 
7.2.Monitoring and Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) 
In the process of achieving climate neutrality the impacts of implemented policy measures 
become known as well as several intended and unintended changes occur which need to be 
monitored and reacted to. During the implementation of the NCDS, the covered areas need 
to  be  monitored in  order  to  provide  the  most appropriate  social,  economic  and 
environmental response measures.    
First and foremost, the successful implementation of the NCDS requires the close monitoring 
and  evaluation  of  GHG  emissions,  ensuring  an appropriate measurement  as  well  as  the 
continuous improvement of the monitoring system. Monitoring GHG emissions is carried out 
according to the strict measures identified by the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 
UNFCCC and the EU, following the detailed methodology guidelines of the IPCC. The 
comprehensive  National  GHG  Inventory  Report,  in  line  with  international  and  EU 
regulations,  is  published  annually  on  the  website  of  the  UNFCCC  and  the  European 
Commission. The most important tools for monitoring and evaluating GHG emissions are the 
reports submitted to the UNFCCC and to the European Commission.  
For future adjustments, it is important to monitor the implementation of the NCDS and the 
impact of its interventions, alongside GHG emissions. Instead of introducing new monitoring 
processes, relying on existing methods should be encouraged such as the ones used for the 
NECP.  
 
7.3. Revision 
The NCDS should be considered as a „living” document, therefore its implementation needs 
to be monitored, reviewed from regularly – mainly based on international and EU policy 
changes – and adjusted if necessary. The schedule of the revision should follow the revision 
cycle of the Paris Agreement and the EU while taking into account:  
  the reports submitted to the UN and European Commission and their independent 
expert evaluation,  
  the most recent available scientific results and policy information,  
  the results of stakeholder consultations,  
  the opinion of the Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change and the findings of 
the National Climate Change Assessment Reports,  
  and the practical experiences of the NCDS implementation.
