P. 97 RESOLUTION OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERSPREFACE
The signature of the Paris Agreement was one of the first official acts in which I had the privilege of participating as Minister of 
the Environment, responsible for the climate portfolio. A year later, at the COP 22 in Marrakech, the Prime-Minister committed to 
achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, in a pioneering act of leadership, placing Portugal among those who advocate greater ambition 
in climate action. 
Our political orientation has been structured with a long-term vision, coupled with immediate action, around three interconnected 
axes: the valorisation of territory and habitats, a more circular economy and the decarbonisation of society and energy transition, 
with the ultimate objective being the promotion of wealth and wellbeing.
The 2050 Carbon Neutrality Roadmap for Portugal (RNC2050) was developed in alignment with the territorial dimension included in 
the National Spatial Planning Policy Program and incorporating the orientations of the Circular Economy Action Plan. I also highlight 
the unprecedented participation of the civil society, which was guaranteed throughout the different phases of the elaboration of the 
RNC2050 and allowed for a wide public discussion of its results.
The RNC2050 sets the path to carbon neutrality in a sustained manner, establishes the main guidelines and identifies cost-effective 
options to achieve this end in different socio-economic development scenarios
Accomplishing carbon neutrality in Portugal implies reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 85%, compared to 2005, 
and ensuring an agricultural and forestry carbon sequestration capacity of around 13 million tonnes. As Portugal is one of the 
countries that is most potentially affected by climate change, ensuring a sustainable and resilient agriculture and forest, and 
fighting desertification, are the biggest challenges we face, They must be coordinated with territorial cohesion and the protection of 
biodiversity, in order to ensure we achieve the said neutrality.
In line with the results of the IPCC Report on 1.5 ºC, it is by 2030 that the largest effort to reduce emissions will be placed, and this 
ambition has already been translated into the 2030 National Energy and Climate Plan, with a clear focus on energy transition and 
sustainable mobility.
The RNC2050 demonstrated that carbon neutrality can be achieved with positive impacts on the economy and employment. The 
transition to a carbon neutral economy, together with the energy transition that is needed, implies a significant investment, being 
necessary to ensure social justice in the way investments are funded. In order to promote investments towards a carbon neutral 
economy, Portugal initiated, in 2019, a debate about sustainable finance, which has led to the Letter of Commitment to Sustainable 
Financing in Portugal, that was subscribed by the large majority of the Portuguese financial sector.
Achieving carbon neutrality implies changing from a linear, fossil fuel-based economic model to a circular, carbon-neutral model. It 
implies a profound transformation of society as we know it. This is a process that brings challenges, but above all opportunities, and 
only with everyone’s contribution will be possible to operate a just and cohesive transition.
We have no time to hesitate. We can be flexible in solutions, but we cannot have margin on the set goals. Effective and ambitious 
climate action is key.
We must act before it is too late. The path to carbon neutrality is the path of the future.

FRAMEWORK 
INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN FRAMEWORK
The Paris Agreement1, adopted in 2015, sets three overall objectives, namely, to limit the average global temperature increase to 
well below 2 °C and to pursue efforts to limit the average global temperature increase to 1.5 °C, acknowledging that this would 
significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change; increase the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change 
and promote climate resilience and low carbon development; and to make financial flows become consistent with resilient and low 
carbon development trajectories.
The Paris Agreement further stipulates that, to attain these objectives, it will be necessary to achieve carbon neutrality in the 
second half of this century, establishing that all Parties to the Agreement must prepare and communicate in a successive and 
progressively more ambitious manner their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions. In this context, all Parties are invited to submit, by 2020, their long-term development strategies with low GHG 
emissions2. 
This agreement marks a new era of global mobilisation to address climate change and represents a paradigm shift in the 
implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), with explicit acknowledgement that 
only with everyone’s contribution is it possible overcome the challenge of climate change.
Limiting the increase in global average temperature to 1.5 °C, in line with the most ambitious objectives of the Paris Agreement, 
requires an unprecedented transformation of modern societies and urgent and profound emission reductions in all sectors of 
activity, as well as changes in behaviour and the involvement of all parties. 
The Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the impacts of an average global temperature 
increase of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels is decisive in affirming that human activities have already caused approximately 1 °C 
of global warming over pre-industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8 °C to 1.2 °C, and that, with current expected trends in global 
emissions, the 1.5 °C level will be reached between 2030 and 2052.
Limitation of the average global temperature increase to 1.5 °C in relation to the pre-industrial period is crucial as it may prevent 
irreversible impacts of global warming. The difference between an increase of 1.5 °C and 2 °C is significant in terms of impacts 
and consequences for ecosystems and the economy, especially given that these are global average values and that the average 
temperature increase in more vulnerable areas of the planet could be even higher. The impacts of recent extreme events such as 
heat waves, droughts, floods and forest fires demonstrate the significant vulnerability and exposure to climate variability of some 
ecosystems and many societies.

LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
The IPCC Special Report states that, in order not to exceed 1.5 °C of global temperature increase, global net anthropogenic 
CO emissions should fall until 2030 by about 45% from 2010 levels, reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. To keep the average 
2
global temperature rise below 2 °C, global CO  emissions must decrease by around 25% by 2030 and carbon neutrality will have 
2
to be reached by 2070. Emissions of other greenhouse gases also have to decrease significantly, to limit the temperature rise to 
either 1.5 °C or 2 °C. These are global goals to be achieved by the countries of the world in general.
Maintaining the average global temperature increase within the limit of 1.5 °C is still possible but requires unprecedented change 
and urgent action to avoid the worst of its expected impacts and the costs associated with adapting our societies and economies to 
those impacts. The reduction of future damage will depend on the level of global warming that it is possible to avoid, and therefore 
on the rapid reduction of GHG emissions. In this context, it is crucial that as many countries as possible that are net emitters of GHG 
today achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible. 
It is widely acknowledged, and reinforced by the conclusions of the IPCC Special Report, that the later that measures known to be 
necessary and unavoidable are taken, the greater the costs of delayed action, and the more significant and rapid the GHG reductions 
will have to be in the post-2030 period. 
In 20143 the European Union (EU) defined its goal for GHG reduction in the period from 2021 to 2030 by setting a binding target of 
at least 40% internal reduction of GHG emissions throughout the economy by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. 
This goal was embodied in the first EU Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for the 2030 horizon under the Paris Agreement 
commitments and underpinned the preparation of the 2030 Climate and Energy legislative framework. This Climate and Energy 
framework includes the EU-level policy targets and objectives for the period of 2021-2030, including at least a 40% reduction in 
GHG emissions (compared to 1990); at least 32% of energy derived from renewable sources4; and an improvement of at least 
32.5% in energy efficiency5.
The European Commission presented the Communication “A Clean Planet for All”, in November 2018, which proposes a long-term 
strategic vision for a thriving, modern, competitive economy that permits the achievement of zero net GHG emissions by 2050, 
providing the basis for the EU’s long-term development strategy to be submitted to the UNFCCC under the Paris Agreement. 
The analysis conducted by the Commission indicates that the policies and objectives already established in the EU will 
allow a reduction of its GHG emissions by around 45% by 2030 and around 60% by 2050. However, this figure falls 
far short of the 80-95% reductions in GHG emissions that will be required for the EU to reach the target of carbon 
neutrality  by  2050  and  contribute  adequately  to  the  long-term  temperature  objective  set  by  the  Paris  Agreement.

LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
The EU’s long-term strategy is seen to be crucial for outlining the best course for meeting the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 
2050 in the EU, through a socially fair, cost-effective transition that ensures the active participation of citizens, presenting a clear 
message of a paradigm shift in terms of production and consumption models, changes in the way of viewing financial flows and 
research, innovation and knowledge, and aligning action in key areas, from energy - with particular focus on the importance of 
renewable energy and energy efficiency - to mobility, the role of buildings and industry and suitable agroforestry management.

LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
NATIONAL COMPLIANCE
In 2016, the Portuguese government pledged to ensure neutrality of its emissions by the end of 2050, outlining a clear view on 
intense decarbonisation of the national economy, as a contribution to the Paris Agreement and in line with the most ambitious efforts 
under way at an international level. 
The commitment to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 means achieving a neutral balance between GHG emissions and carbon 
sequestration, for which substantial reductions in emissions and/or substantial increases in national carbon sinks will be required, 
which have to materialise between now and 2050. The national commitment does not foresee having recourse to international 
carbon credits to achieve the carbon neutrality goal.
In order to achieve this goal, the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Roadmap (RNC2050) has been developed, identifying the main 
decarbonisation vectors in all sectors of the economy, the policy and measures options and the emission reduction path to achieve 
this end, in different scenarios of socioeconomic development. All sectors must contribute to reducing emissions, increasing 
efficiency and innovation, promoting improvements, notably in buildings, agriculture, waste management and industry, with the 
energy system making the greatest contribution, particularly as regards electricity generation and transport.
RNC2050 is also the national strategy for long-term low-GHG development to be submitted to the UNFCCC, in accordance with the 
Paris Agreement, and to the European Commission, in accordance with the EU Regulation on Governance of the Energy Union and 
Climate Action.
The elaboration of RNC2050 was carried out in parallel with the preparatory work for the National Energy and Climate Plan (PNEC), 
which will be the main energy and climate policy instrument for the decade 2021-2030, setting new national targets for the 
reduction of GHG emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency in line with the objective of carbon neutrality. 
The PNEC emerges within the framework of the obligations laid down by the Regulations of Governance of the Energy Union and 
Climate Action, which provide for all Member States to draw up and periodically submit to the European Commission a PNEC that 
establishes national targets and objectives for GHG emissions, renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy security, internal market 
and research, innovation and competitiveness, as well as a clear approach regarding how to achieve them.
Portugal is a country with a proven record on climate policy, having met the goals defined in the Kyoto Protocol targets and is on 
course for compliance with the 2020 goals for emissions reduction, energy efficiency and promotion of sources of renewable energy.
Looking towards 2030, the first step towards achieving the 2030 European Climate and Energy Package at a national level was 
taken in 2015 with approval of the Strategic Framework for Climate Policy (QEPiC), with a vision of decarbonising the economy and 
placing the country in better conditions to meet the challenges created by the Paris Agreement. 
The QEPiC established an integrated, complementary and articulated framework of climate policy instruments for the horizon 
2020/2030, in liaison with air policies, with the approval of the National Climate Change Program (PNAC 2020 - 2030), which 
identifies the guidelines for policies and measures that can ensure achievement of the new emissions reduction targets for 2020 
and 2030, and the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (ENAAC 2020). 
It was then established that Portugal should reduce its GHG emissions from -18% to -23% by 2020 and from -30% to -40% by 
2030, compared to the 2005 figures, contingent on the results of the European negotiations, and sectoral targets for the reduction 
of GHG emissions were also defined. 
9RNC2050
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
The establishment of these targets was underpinned by the National Low Carbon Roadmap 2050 (RNBC), which was the first long-
term modelling exercise of national emissions, carried out at a national level. In the Roadmap, it was stated that it was possible to 
achieve national emissions reductions of between -50% and -60%, compared to 1990, which corresponds to a reduction of -60% 
to -70% in the energy sector compared to 19907. It can be seen that the potential for reducing emissions that was modelled at that 
time is already outdated, essentially as a result of faster than anticipated developments in technology. 
PROGRESS MADE IN REDUCING NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
Following the rapid growth in GHG emissions seen during the 1990s, Portugal reached its peak of national emissions in 2005, after 
which they recorded a significant and sustained fall, and since then have consolidated a trend of decarbonisation of the national 
economy.
In fact, in 2005 it was verified that emissions increased by about 44% compared to 1990 levels. In 2017, according to the most 
recent update of the 2019 National Emissions Inventory, GHG emissions, without considering emissions due to land use changes 
and forests (LULUCF), are estimated at about 70.7 Mt CO eq, representing an increase of around 19.5% compared to 1990.
2
Considering the LULUCF sector, total emissions in 2017 are estimated at 78.0 Mt CO eq, corresponding to an increase of 29.2% 
2
over 1990. This marked growth is related to the rural fires that occurred in the tragic year of 2017, a situation associated with 
a particularly dry year, the high recorded temperatures that occurred outside the normal summer period (the largest rural fires 
occurred in June and October), and unusually strong winds, such as Hurricane Ophelia that struck the coast of the Iberian Peninsula 
in October 2017.

NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
An analysis of GHG emissions per unit of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) shows that a decoupling trend between GDP and emissions 
started in 2005, resulting from decarbonisation of the economy, that is, an economy with less carbon emitted for each unit of 
produced wealth that is being maintained.

GDP GHG emissions Carbon Intensity
Several factors underlie this trend, such as the significant growth of energy produced from renewable energy sources (mainly wind 
and water), and the implementation of energy efficiency measures, as well as the replacement of more polluting energy sources 
such as fuel oil by natural gas, with the construction of more efficient combined cycle power plants and cogeneration units. 
Public policies on climate change are now an integral part of a series of sectoral policies in Portugal. Indeed, in areas such as 
energy and industry covered by the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the ‘carbon dimension’ is now part of the strategic 
and economic considerations of the companies concerned. In agriculture and forestry there is also a growing awareness of the 
important contribution that the sector can make in terms of mitigating GHG emissions. In areas with major challenges such as 
transport, steps have been taken to decarbonise vehicle fleets and an electric mobility network has been set up and electric vehicle 
support schemes introduced with the aim of reinforcing incentives for the introduction of vehicles of this kind. Similarly, in the area 
of the freight transport system, in particular maritime and inland waterways transport, important steps have been taken in line 
with the Strategy for Increasing Port Competitiveness - Horizon 2026, where national ports are an essential pillar for sustainable 
economic development, with progress in the adaptation of their infrastructures to increasing ship size and overall demand, as 
well as adjustment for the promotion of inland waterway transport, in parallel with increasing electrification of equipment and the 
introduction of supply systems of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The implementation of the Single Logistics Window, which will lead 
to process dematerialisation and the monitoring of goods with tracking and tracing processes, will contribute significantly to the 
promotion of an efficient logistics chain as an aggregating and fundamental tool in a modal division of transport of goods with lower 
carbon intensity.
The Portuguese experience shows that ambitious climate policies can go hand in hand with economic growth, job creation, people’s 
health and the environment. Nowadays, Portugal is already producing more wealth with less emissions and this is the way forward 
to continue building a strategy towards carbon neutrality and a carbon neutral economy.

2. 
VISION AND FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES
In 2016, at the 22nd Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change in Marrakech, Portugal set itself 
the goal of achieving Carbon Neutrality by 2050, outlining clear guidelines with regard to intense decarbonisation of the national 
economy, contributing to the most ambitious objectives set in the framework of the Paris Agreement. 
This RNC2050 sets out the vision and trajectories and identifies guidelines for the policies and measures needed to achieve this 
goal. RNC2050 is also Portugal’s Long-Term Strategy to be submitted to the EU and the UNFCCC under the Paris Agreement.
The transition to a carbon neutral economy requires timely long-term planning that allows advantage to be taken of opportunities 
associated with the inherent transformation of the economy and to establish the basis of trust among all the citizens and economic 
agents that this change is possible, advantageous and timely.
RNC2050 provides insight into key future trends and the necessary economic and social transformations, involving all sectors of 
the economy and society, in order to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, through a socially fair and efficient transition 
in terms of costs, strengthening the competitiveness of the national economy, promoting job creation and enhancing co-benefits 
associated in particular with air quality and human health. This transition must also be a factor of valorisation of the country and a 
contribution to national cohesion. In this context, RNC2050 was elaborated in conjunction with the principles established in other 
important circular economy strategies, particularly by following the guidelines set forth in the Circular Economy Action Plan, and 
in the planning and spatial planning of the country, specifically the proposal of the National Program of Spatial Planning Policies, 
without prejudice to the different time horizons.
Achievement of the objective of carbon neutrality in 2050 is based on a strategic vision aimed at promoting decarbonisation of the 
economy and the energy transition towards carbon neutrality by 2050, as an opportunity for the country, based on a democratic and 
fair model of national cohesion that enhances the generation of wealth and the efficient use of resources.
Realisation of this strategic vision rests on eight key premises, described in more detail in the following sections: 
i)  iPromote the transition to a competitive, circular, resilient and carbon neutral economy, generating more wealth, 
employment and well-being;
ii)  Identify decarbonisation vectors and lines of action that underlie the route to carbon neutrality by 2050; 
iii)  Contribute to resilience and the national capacity to adapt to climate change vulnerabilities and impacts;
iv)  Stimulate research, innovation and knowledge production in key areas to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality;
v)  Guarantee financing conditions and increase investment levels;
12RNC2050
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
vi)  Ensure a fair and cohesive transition that contributes to valorisation of the country;
vii)  Ensure effective conditions for monitoring progress towards the goal of carbon neutrality (governance) and ensure 
the adoption of carbon neutral objectives in the sectoral areas;
viii)  Involve society in the challenges of climate change, focusing on education, information and awareness raising, 
contributing to increasing individual and collective action.
This vision will necessarily have to be translated into the various sectoral policy strategies and instruments in energy, transport, 
trade, services, industry, waste, agriculture and forests, taking into account the decarbonisation vectors identified and to be pursued 
by the country over the next 30 years.

THE TRANSITION TO A COMPETITIVE, CIRCULAR, RESILIENT AND 
CARBON NEUTRAL ECONOMY 
The current economic model is based on the exploitation of resources (extraction of fossil fuels, raw materials, soil and water), which 
are transformed, used and returned to the environment as waste or emissions to the atmosphere. This linear economic model is not 
sustainable and is the basis of most of the environmental problems: air, water and soil pollution; the impermeability and expansion 
of urbanised areas, the need to continuously expand the areas dedicated to agriculture, livestock and forestry, and the consequent 
reduction of biodiversity, deforestation and destruction of natural habitats.
The challenge of carbon neutrality thus fits into the broader theme of how to survive and thrive on a finite planet, as a species that 
continues to grow in population and legitimately desires to achieve increasing standards of comfort and security, without, in this 
process, creating disruptions that jeopardise the survival of the human species and all the other species that share the planet with 
us. One, and perhaps the greatest, of these ongoing disruptions is climate change.
Part of the response to the challenge of climate change lies in the use of renewable energy sources, greater efficiency and circularity 
in resource use and the reinforcement of carbon sinks. Renewable energies already have the potential to replace a very significant 
part of fossil fuels and thus eliminate emissions and other pollution associated with their exploitation and use, noting also, in this 
context, the new challenges and contributions of oceanic renewable energy. Increasing economy circularity and efficiency will make 
it possible to do more with less resources, reduce raw material consumption and transform a waste chain into a new material chain. 
Reinforcing carbon sinks will have an extremely important impact on reducing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 
and on climate regulation.
This profound transformation of society is not only compatible with the goal of carbon neutrality, but in fact will be one of the engines 
to achieve that neutrality.
The goal of decarbonisation must also be addressed in the context of adaptation to climate change. The more marked these 
changes, the greater the costs that the country will have to bear with the disruption of agriculture, with fires, with degradation of the 
coastline, with the health and safety of people, particularly during heatwaves and other extreme climate events. Carbon neutrality, 
as a goal shared by all countries, will be the engine for limiting the extent of climate change and thus the key factor for limiting the 
volume of losses associated with the damage it would cause. 
In the economic sphere, both the objective of carbon neutrality and adaptation to climate change can and should be seen not only as 
a cost to be avoided for the economy, but also as an opportunity for the country, with the creation of new sectors, clusters, business 
models, and for conversion of current linear production lines into an economic circularity.
In this context, it will be essential to ensure a stable and competitive regulatory framework, that guarantees the involvement 
and commitment of the main actors, public and private, with implementation of the measures necessary to achieve the defined 
objectives, thus providing stability for investors in the most diverse sectors.

LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
Decarbonisation should be based on principles of technological diversity, removing any regulatory constraints, perverse subsidies 
and other restrictions that create distortions in the workings of the market (which should promote more efficient and competitive 
solutions but taking into account the entire value chain of each solution).
It should be noted that the strategic vision of achieving carbon neutrality based on the eight premises set out above constitutes 
an important contribution to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, namely SDG 13 - Climate action defined as 
one of the Priority Objectives for Portugal in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The development model 
proposed in this strategic vision will also contribute to meeting the goals associated with other SDGs, of which we highlight SDG 
1 - Eradicating Poverty, SDG 3 - Quality Health; SDG 4 - Quality Education; SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth; SDG 
9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure; SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities; SDG 12 - Sustainable Production and 
Consumption and SDG 15 - Protecting Life on Earth.

TRAJECTORIES FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2050
The objective of carbon neutrality means equating the level of GHG emissions with the carbon sink level by the year 2050 (net 
emissions equal to zero). This will require substantial emissions reductions and/or substantial increases in national carbon sinks, 
which should be implemented between now and 2050.
Portugal’s average annual emissions in the decade 2007-2017 were 69 Mt CO  (54 to 74 Mt CO ). When broken down by sector, 
2 2
national emissions are distributed by: 25% in energy production, 25% in transport, 23% in industry, 10% in agriculture, 8% in other 
energy uses; and 8% in waste.
Carbon sinks are the result of some land uses, notably in agriculture, pastures, forests and scrubland, and, during this period, they 
absorbed from the atmosphere about -8.5 Mt CO  (from -13 to +7 Mt CO ), or about -12% of the emissions from the other sectors8.
2 2
The net total of emissions and carbon sinks is therefore currently 60 Mt CO , and this is the order of magnitude that will have to be 
2
reduced by 2050 in order to achieve carbon neutrality.
The potential for reducing emissions and increasing carbon sinks is not the same in all sectors of the economy and for all greenhouse 
gases. In some sectors, technologies are available and are cost-effective, while in others very large reductions are not possible 
(without reducing the sector’s activity) or are extremely expensive. 
Also, the cost of each technology is not constant over time, and it is expected in most cases that the technologies currently most 
innovative and still relatively expensive will become progressively more cost-effective over time.
The identification of GHG emission trajectories to achieve carbon neutrality is supported by modelling exercises that cover all sectors 
of the economy with significant contributions to national total emissions and all the important GHGs. It was also intended to evaluate 
whether there is technological and economic viability for the Portuguese economy to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, using only 
technologies and processes known today (albeit with different technological maturity).
RNC2050 is based on three alternative macroeconomic scenarios for development of the Portuguese economy and on two sets 
of objectives for each scenario. In the first set of objectives, it was sought to evaluate the evolution of emissions in a scenario of 
maintenance of the current trend of climate policies in force, representing a significant decarbonisation trajectory of the national 
economy. In this case, the economy grows and reduces emissions, but this reduction is mainly due to the introduction of more 
efficient and/or less emitting technologies (e.g. renewable energy sources or electric vehicles) through their cost-effective potential 
and the progressive reduction of their cost. In the second set of objectives, it was sought to evaluate the evolution of emissions in 
a carbon neutral scenario, translated into a trajectory of reduction of emissions of the energy system of -60% by 2030 and -90% 
by 2050 compared to 2005.
8 It should be noted that the size of the national carbon sink varies greatly between years, mainly due to the influence of the rural fires each year. In 2017, when the fires were exceptionally 
dramatic, this sector was not as it usually is a carbon sink, but rather an additional source of emissions (at around 7 Mt CO2). Excluding that year, the average over the last decade would 
be -10 Mt CO.

The scenarios modelled offer support for the technological viability of carbon neutrality by 2050, based on a trajectory of emissions 
reductions of -45% to -55% by 2030, -65% to -75% by 2040 and -85% to -90% by 2050, compared to 2005, assuming a carbon 
sink value of between -9 and -13 Mt CO .
2
From the modelling performed it is clear that:
•	 Given the scale of the challenge (zero net emissions by 2050) all sectors will be called upon to contribute, either by 
reducing their emissions or by increasing their carbon sink capacity.
•	 The potential reduction of each sector is different, that is, the contribution that each sector can make to reduce 
emissions is not equally cost-effective.
•	 It is possible to identify the main vectors and technologies that, with current knowledge, will allow a decarbonisation 
trajectory to be achieved.
From the broadest view of the results, two main and complementary decarbonisation vectors stand out clearly: reduction of the 
carbon intensity of electricity produced in Portugal; and replacement of fossil fuels by electricity in most sectors of the economy 
(electrification of the economy). 
Energy production and consumption will therefore become based on endogenous and renewable sources of energy, which in itself 
constitutes the biggest transformation of the energy paradigm in Portugal since the industrial revolution, reinforcing the path that 
Portugal has been following in recent years.
Also, with the horizontal nature of most sectors of the economy, we can highlight very significant gains in energy efficiency and 
resource use efficiency, which will allow the economy to grow, while reducing primary and final energy consumption as well as 
consumption of materials, also with a logic of greater circularity.
18RNC2050
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
In electricity generation the transformation will be profound (99% reduction in GHG emissions compared to 2005) and will be 
achieved with significant investments in new renewable capacity, in particular wind and photovoltaic energy, and in a big reduction 
or abandonment of electricity produced with fossil fuels such as coal, fuel oil and natural gas, supported by a resilient, flexible and 
modern system.
Decarbonisation of the transport sector will be almost total (98% reduction in GHG emissions compared to 2005) and will be based 
fundamentally on strengthening the role of the public transport system and replacing current fossil fuel vehicles with a mainly 
electric fleet. The use of hydrogen and advanced biofuels will also play an important role in replacing current fuels. The conversion 
of mobility in private vehicles into other forms of mobility (public, active, shared, autonomous) will significantly increase the volume 
of passengers or goods transported, without the need to increase fleets, particularly that of private cars.
Both residential and service buildings will also make a significant contribution to decarbonisation (reductions of over 96% compared 
to 2005), due to an almost total electrification of energy consumption, further supported by large energy efficiency gains through 
reinforcing the insulation of buildings, the use of solar heating and heat pumps.
In industry the reductions will be less significant but still quite large. Reductions of around 80% will be possible in emissions from 
burning fuels, through electrification, biomass use and efficiency increases, while for emissions that result from industrial processes 
the potential is much more limited (less diversity of cost-effective technologies available), and therefore emissions reductions are 
expected to be around 60%, which translates into an overall emission reduction potential of around 73%.
The use of fluorinated gases will be reduced by 54% by 2050, compared to the emissions values observed in 2005. This is due 
to the reduction imposed by implementation of the Kigali Agreement and the European Regulations, which restrict the production, 
consumption and market availability of Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).
Emissions from agriculture, particularly those from animal production, have a lower potential for reduction, and this sector will 
reduce its emissions by 9% to 30% by 2050. Possible options include improvements in animal feed and manure management 
systems, and reduced fertilisation and water needs boosted by biological and precision agriculture, respectively. Agricultural land 
and pastures have the potential to cease being a source of emissions and become sources of sequestration, through conservation 
agriculture, by replacing mineral fertilisers with organic fertilisers and sowing improved and biodiverse pastures. Considering 
emissions from agriculture and from agricultural lands and pastures as a single system, the potential for emissions reduction rises 
from 40% to 60%.
Other land uses, including forests, can significantly increase current sequestration levels to around 11-13 million tonnes of CO , and 
2
for this to happen, it is essential to control areas set on fire annually and to achieve productivity increases across forestry species 
in general.
For waste and wastewater, reductions will be more significant (around 75% compared to 2005) due to a sharp increase in the 
circularity of the economy, the elimination of organic waste in landfills and the reduction of total and organic waste produced per 
capita. Some of the alternative destinations for these wastes (biological treatment and composting) may, for the same reasons, 
increase, but their effect on total emissions will remain small.

In the Peloton and Yellow Jersey scenarios, two variants were 
also considered, one in which the economy evolves without 
imposing a GHG emission reduction target (called ‘without 
neutrality’) and a variant in which the economy evolves with 
the imposition of a GHG emissions reduction target (called 
‘with neutrality’).

4.1. ROLE OF THE ENERGY SYSTEM IN THE TRANSITION TO CARBON NEUTRALITY
The energy system covers in an integrated manner energy production, transport and distribution and final energy consumption in 
the various sectors (industry, transport, residential and services and agriculture). 
It is possible to identify, with current technologies and knowledge about their future evolution, neutrality trajectories with cost-
effective options to achieve emissions reductions of around 60% by 2030 and 90% by 2050 (compared to 2005). These trajectories 
express a mix of technologies that minimises the cost to the national energy system, through progressive technological substitution, 
that begins with the sectors/technologies for which the transition is most cost-effective and progressively expands to more expensive 
sectors/technologies, until the desired emissions reductions are achieved. No support, fiscal or otherwise, was considered for any 
technology.
As a consequence, we will see a significant change in the primary and final energy balances, the technological profile of energy 
production and consumption and the sectoral dissociation from emissions.

In fact, the path towards carbon neutrality will lead to a much wider use of endogenous renewable energy resources of which over 
two thirds are sun and wind, accounting for over 80% of primary energy consumption by 2050. The national energy system thus 
moves from an essentially fossil base to an essentially renewable base by 2050, with positive consequences for the energy bill, the 
trade balance and the reduction of energy dependency, which drops from the current 78% of dependence on foreign countries to 
less than 20% in 2050.

Achieving this level of reductions will also be supported by decarbonisation of final energy consumption, where there will be 
increased integration of renewable energy sources and increasing electrification of energy consumption, visible from 2030 onwards, 
and these are the main vectors of decarbonisation. In 2050, between 66% and 68% of final energy consumption will be met by 
electricity and there will be a sharp reduction in the consumption of petroleum products, explained by the technological change that 
will take place, especially in the car fleet.
The emergence of new energy vectors, such as hydrogen, is gradually coming to fruition, reaching an overall contribution of 4% 
in final energy consumption by 2050, but which will be an important decarbonisation vector in some sectors with few alternative 
technological options, such as heavy passenger and freight transport, a sector which will represent, in 2050, 40% to 68% of the 
demand for heavy transport.
This hydrogen will be produced mainly by alkaline electrolysis using renewable electricity, and by 2050, 5% to 8% of all electricity 
produced will be used for hydrogen generation. 
With a more limited role, other renewable sources, such as solar heating and biomass, will also play an important role, for example, 
in heat generation.
Biomass is also emerging as one of the decarbonisation vectors. Overall, its consumption will grow until 2030/35, falling later to 
below current levels, with the emergence or increase of other more competitive energy vectors. 
It is in the industrial sector that the consumption of biomass is most evident, replacing, among other sources, petroleum coke. 
Decentralised cogeneration and dedicated heat production plants near the collection sites will allow the most cost-effective use of 
the resource and also contribute to sustainable forest management.

4.1.1 Power generation sector
The power generation sector is currently one of the leading national GHG emitters (around 29%) and as such shall be one of the 
major contributors to decarbonisation. Moreover, given the expected role of electrification in decarbonisation of the remaining 
sectors, emissions from power generation will also have a very significant indirect contribution to make to decarbonisation of the 
economy as a whole. These two contributions to a carbon neutral society point to the need to progressively discontinue the use 
of fossil fuels in power generation, in particular coal, and Portugal has already made a commitment to cease coal-based power 
generation by 2030.
Increasing demand caused by the growing electrification of various sectors of society will dictate the need for a substantial increase 
in renewable power production capacity by 2050.

This transition is facilitated by the reduction in the cost of renewable-based technologies for electricity generation that has been 
observed in recent years, especially in technologies associated with solar photovoltaics. In fact, it is this cost reduction, coupled also 
with an expected rapid fall in the cost of storage solutions, that will allow renewable energy to have a participation close to 100% 
in electricity production in 2050.
Photovoltaic solar technology will be most clearly established by increasing its importance and reaching 13 GW centralised and 13 
GW decentralised by 2050. Onshore wind energy is also increasing its share significantly (almost 2.5x). These two technologies 
have a cost-effective potential to jointly supply 50% of the electricity generated in 2030 and 70% in 2050. However, these 
technologies, due to their daily and inter-annual variability, pose challenges in terms of dependability and security of supply that it is 
essential to be aware of and for which new solutions are emerging, be they technological in terms of battery storage and hydrogen 
production. or hybrid solutions, or in terms of network management, which should be endowed with greater intelligence and 
flexibility. Interconnections with the EU power grid and with other markets will also have an important role to play in the management 
and security of supply of the national power system.
Maintaining some natural gas capacity in the national power system until 2040, even if marginally used, ensures the necessary 
backup to bring about the transition to a renewable-based power system, allowing time for the development and installation of 
technological storage solutions.
In this context, batteries will become a cost-effective technology that is necessary for stability of the system as early as 2025 (187 
MW), coupled with a renewable sun and wind capacity that will exceed 16 GW. However, it is from the 2030s onwards that the 
weight of this technology gains expression, reaching values between 0.6 and 1.0 GW in 2030 and growing by 4 GW up to 2050, 
accounting for between 7% and 8% of the total installed capacity in a 100% renewable system.
Along with batteries, mostly associated with decentralised solar energy, hydroelectric production using pumped water will also 
continue to play an important role in regulating the power system. The existing capacity together with the investments in progress 
means that in 2030 there will be 3.4 GW of pumped hydroelectric capacity. 
Together, batteries and pumped hydroelectric, in 2050, will account for 7.5 GW, about 14% of total installed capacity, offering 
storage and facilitating efficient management of the electric supply/demand equilibrium.
Electrification of the economy will require an expansion of the transmission and distribution network which should be linked to 
efficient consumption management (e.g. in industry) and allow the creation of new business models and solutions that contribute 
to the flexibility of the system.
New regulatory models will allow new players to enter the electricity market, such as energy production cooperatives and energy 
communities. The increase in installed capacity of decentralised solar to 2.3 GW by 2030 and 12 to 13 GW by 2050 demonstrates 
the cost-effectiveness of decentralisation in solar electricity generation, allowing one to envisage the important role of producers/
consumers in the future. Families and other small producers may account for more than 20% of total electricity production. Of 
course, this vision requires the development of smart distribution networks and new locally based business models.
Decentralisation of electricity generation combined with its increased efficiency will contribute to a reduction in grid losses, reaching 
around 5% by 2050, compared to the current 9%. This fall in grid losses attenuates the increasing consumption of hydroelectric 
pumping and battery storage.

policy options to be pursued.
Main decarbonisation drivers in the power generation sector:
•	 Evolution to a production base that uses solar (centralised and 
decentralised), wind (onshore and offshore) and hydroelectric (with 
and without pumping);
•	 End of electricity production based on coal by 2030 and, in a second 
phase, end of electricity production based on natural gas after 2040;
•	 New storage solutions (batteries and hydrogen);
•	 Greater network intelligence and flexibility.

4.1.2 Mobility and transport
The transport sector is, together with the power generation system, one of the main national emitters (representing about 25% of 
emissions) and is the sector with the highest growth in emissions in recent decades. This sector includes road, rail and maritime 
transport and aviation (only its national components) and can be divided into passenger and freight transport.
The road subsector accounts for 96% of transport emissions, with national rail, aviation and shipping accounting for only 4% of 
emissions. Car use accounts for 60% of emissions in relation to the total for road transport. 
This is also the sector with the highest energy intensity and the largest indirect contribution to primary energy imports and associated 
energy dependence. These transport modes have quite low usage efficiency rates, with values of about 1.2 passengers per private 
vehicle and average public transport occupancy between 17% and 24% (percentages below the European average), leaving room 
for significant efficiency gains.

by 2050.

In this sector, the availability of technology solutions with better environmental performance and the offer of shared solutions 
with significant efficiency gains make it possible to substantially reduce emissions in a cost-effective way, even in the context of 
increasing demand.
The growing adherence expected for the use of low-impact and active modes in urban centres, together with proactive land use 
planning that allows for greater discussion and use of the public transport system, will form the basis of a veritable revolution in this 
sector, and these vectors are essential for its decarbonisation. In 2050, between 8% and 14% of short-distance mobility is expected 
to be made using low-impact modes.
35RNC2050
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
It is therefore essential to reinforce the supply of public transport systems, and to expand the networks (metro and rail) and 
their multimodal integration. All these changes will be part of a very diverse and decarbonised transport ecosystem, in which 
complementarity and modal articulation, coupled with even greater digitisation, will lead to progressively greater gains in efficiency. 
Electrification, based on renewable sources, throughout all end-consumer sectors will soon allow a relatively rapid transition from 
the current internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles, with electricity reaching around 70% of total transport energy 
consumption by 2050. 
In a transitional phase, hybrid vehicles will play an important role in decarbonisation, mainly in individual transport, and advanced 
biofuels, especially in heavy long-distance intercity transport of passengers and freight by road, where the distances travelled are 
longer. However, as time goes by, biofuels may become irrelevant in the road sector, given the greater competitiveness and cost-
effectiveness of electric traction and other energy vectors such as hydrogen, while maintaining some of their importance in sectors 
such as aviation. 
In light passenger transport, diesel will no longer be cost-effective by 2030 and petrol by 2040, in both cases being replaced by 
electric vehicles. Electricity will satisfy more than 30% of the mobility demand in 2030, with a potential to reach 100% by 2050.
As a complement to the use of electric vehicles, forms of shared and/or autonomous mobility will enable huge efficiency gains, with 
higher utilisation rates for each vehicle (more passengers per trip and more trips per day). This type of model will ensure half of 
mobility demand by 2050, which will allow accelerated decarbonisation of the sector.
In the case of heavy vehicles, the possibility of introducing new fuels such as hydrogen (H2) or new dynamic propulsion technologies 
(e.g. overhead contact lines or induction systems) is expected. However, implementation of these solutions will depend on the 
development of core infrastructures, and their investment and operating costs are still subject to a high degree of uncertainty, given 
the small number of pilot projects underway.
These two energy vectors will account for almost all heavy passenger and freight mobility by 2050.
For the shipping sector, the main solutions include energy efficiency measures, and also the use of LNG and biofuels for medium 
and long distances. Electrification, through the introduction of hybrid and electric propulsion systems, is mainly dedicated to inland 
waterway short-distance passenger transport. Also noteworthy is the electrification of quay equipment and the provision of an 
“Onshore power supply” for vessels. It is also worth mentioning the implementation of Portugal’s promotion strategy as an LNG hub 
region for the freight and tourism shipping segments (cruise ships), with international and national impact on decarbonisation, in 
particular on maritime connections between the mainland and the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores.
 
36RNC2050
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
Nationwide aviation should also become substantially electrified by 2050, as electric aeroplanes are expected to be a cost-effective 
solution for distances of up to 1500 km. For greater distances (e.g. transport from the mainland to the Autonomous Regions of 
Madeira and the Azores), the use of hybrid aircraft is expected, which may use biokerosene for takeoff and landing.
These technological changes in mobility give rise to very significant efficiency improvements with an impact on final energy 
consumption, generating by 2050 a reduction in the energy intensity of passenger and freight transport of -81% and -84% 
respectively (energy consumed per passenger transported - pkm) and -73% to -75% (energy consumed per tonne of goods 
transported - tkm).

The circular economy is key to decarbonisation of the transport and mobility 
sector, as the success of shared mobility models is essential to leveraging the 
technological changes foreseen for mobility (e.g. autonomous vehicles) and can 
lead to emissions reductions of up to 25 % in 2050. The most significant impact 
of circularity refers to the significant increase in the use of public transport, which 
leads to a reduction in total transport energy consumption of between 3% and 
2% in 2030 and 2050, respectively.
Main decarbonisation drivers in the transport sector:
•	 Greater efficiency and reinforcement of public transport systems;
•	 Active and low-impact mobility;
•	 Greater efficiency, associated to shared mobility and autonomous 
vehicles;
•	 Electrification;
•	 Biofuels and hydrogen.

4.1.3 Industry and industrial processes
The industrial sector is made up of a wide range of activities and processes, including sectors such as refining, pulp and paper 
production, glass, ceramics, cement and lime, iron and steel, chemicals, among others. Their emissions derive from the consumption 
of fossil fuels and, in some sectors, emissions from the chemical processes involved. Industrial emissions in 2015 accounted for 
about 19% of national emissions, of which 62% are associated with the burning of fossil fuels and 38% associated with process 
emissions. This is a particularly regulated sector as it is covered by the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the sector’s main 
decarbonisation instrument, which applies to 74% of the industry’s emissions.
The evolution of the different industrial sectors is influenced by various market trends and dynamics that may lead to an adjustment 
of production logics and consequently influence the associated emissions. Changes in consumption patterns or factors such as 
the buoyancy of the construction sector, reduced use of plastics in packaging, increased recycling rates or substitution of fuels in 
transport, among other factors, can impact the value chain and lead to readjustment of the industry, which is a challenge for this 
sector.
39RNC2050
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
Industry will be one of the sectors with the greatest challenges for decarbonisation, given the still limited range of technological 
options that allow emissions to be reduced, particularly emissions from industrial processes. 
Despite these aspects, the domestic industry will also undergo profound transformations, reducing its emissions by about 70% 
(compared to 2005).

LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
With a power generation system strongly based on renewable energy, prospects for strengthening the use of electricity are also 
opened for industry. This potential exists in the electrification of some processes and industries, particularly in the less energy-
intensive ones, and in the use of biomass and waste (which will increase 3.5x compared to current values), replacing the use of 
petroleum products from 2030 onwards.
Natural gas emerges as a transitional fuel, increasing its share by 2030 and falling thereafter, as some processes are electrified. 
Along with electrification, high temperature heat from renewable cogeneration and solar heating for low/medium temperature heat 
needs are the main decarbonisation vectors. 
Options such as electric ovens, increased robotisation and the transformation of some sectors into a more digital 4.0 industry drive 
electricity consumption 2x higher than current consumption in the sector and also contribute to decarbonisation in line with carbon 
neutrality by 2050.
Carbon capture and storage is an important option in decarbonisation of the energy system. In Portugal, this technological option 
could only have technical and economic viability in the cement sector, however. But the evolution of national cement production may 
not be large enough to justify the creation of a CO  transport and subsequent storage network, from an economic point of view.
2
In the same vein, and with current knowledge, the bioenergy options with carbon capture and storage are not seen to be cost-effective 
in light of current knowledge. However, acknowledging that these are also priority areas for fostering research and innovation at a 
European level, this scenario could change, and therefore the development of these technologies should be monitored.
Carbon capture and use for production of e-fuels was considered but is not seen to be cost-effective over this time horizon, and this 
technology would always have associated emissions. 
Thus, there is a great need for innovation and the creation of new business models in the industry. Reinforcing the perspectives 
of the circular economy and resource efficiency assumes a determinant character in the path to be followed to identify and create 
innovative, efficient and green solutions, with emission close to zero.
The focus on industrial symbioses and the reuse of resources with greater incorporation of secondary materials and increased 
recyclability of the products produced may bring gains on a medium and long-term time horizon.
All these factors allow, in addition to decarbonisation, very significant gains in energy efficiency in the industry, resulting in a 
reduction in energy intensity of the sector from -52% to -64% in 2050, compared to 2015 (industries of coke manufacturing and 
petroleum products and electricity and gas production not included).

4.1.3.1 Refining and petrochemical industry
As a consequence mainly of the change in the mobility paradigm, the refining sector is expected to evolve into other forms of 
production and product diversification, such as hydrogen production in the post-2030 period and, potentially, reconversion to bio-
refineries, witnessing a significant change in the current production system with a reduction of -64% and -66% of the crude oil 
processed in 2040 and -87% and -88% in 2050, depending on the scenario analysed.
The development of e-fuels is currently not seen to be cost effective, limited by the process costs and costs associated with CO
2 
capture, compared to other energy system mitigation options. As mentioned above, this technology will always be associated with 
CO  emissions.

4.1.3.2 Glass
According to the scenarios studied, the increased use of glass as a substitute for plastic packaging (notably PET) contributes to the 
sector’s increased production, albeit moderately due to relatively low plastic/glass substitutability. However, the circular economy 
coupled with optimised packaging collection and design processes makes it possible to achieve very high levels of incorporation of 
glass containers in the manufacturing process - between 65% and 75% in 2050 (vs. 50% today). An increase in energy efficiency 
and the emergence of electric ovens are expected by 2040 in some units that will allow the sector to reduce energy intensity: 
between -24% and -29% in 2050 compared to 2015.

4.1.3.3 Ceramics
The structural ceramics subsector (tiles, bricks, floors) faces, in the scenarios analysed, some competition from the greater 
introduction of other materials in the construction sector (e.g. wood, cork) associated with a paradigm shift in construction, which 
has already begun to favour materials that are carbon reservoirs. Also, the reuse of ceramic products will contribute to changes in 
this activity. Decarbonisation of the sector is essentially affected by slightly increasing electrification and the use of biomass.
4.1.3.4 Chemical products
The transformation and modernisation of the sector is expected to include the manufacture of synthetic/artificial and bioplastic 
fibres and greater use of secondary raw material. Decarbonisation of this subsector is mainly based on very significant electrification 
associated with its modernisation, with this vector representing almost 90% of final energy consumption in 2050, compared with 
45% today.
4.1.3.5 Iron and steel
The scenarios analysed point to an increase in iron/steel production due to the high openness of the sector to foreign competition 
and its incorporation in growing industries, such as that of renewable energy. In addition, a larger circular economy will allow the 
sector to have more effective and efficient access to raw materials. The current electrification of the sector does not anticipate 
important energy transformations, despite a continued focus on energy efficiency.
4.1.3.6 Cement
The sector may be the subject of some competition due to the substitution of cement with alternative construction materials, 
associated with changes in the construction sector, which also involves a significant increase of productivity in the use of materials.
Decarbonisation of the sector occurs mainly due to reduced incorporation of clinker in cement production (gradual reduction to a 
maximum of -10% by 2050 compared to current levels) and the incorporation of alternative fuels such as those derived from waste, 
vegetable waste and others. In addition, recovery of part of the residual process heat will enable the industry to increase its energy 
efficiency.
New technologies such as the emergence of Oxyfuel furnaces with CO  capture may be an alternative in the future, although their

viability has not yet been seen to be cost-effective today. 
4.1.3.7 Pulp and paper
There may be a change in the productive structure of the sector with a reduction in the production of printing paper, as a result of 
digitisation, and an increase in the production of tissue and packaging paper, in the latter case as a result of the replacement of 
plastic packaging and an increase in digital commerce.
The circular economy contributes to an optimised paper collection process and increased pulp production from secondary fibre 
(between 50% and 70% by 2050). The sector continues its path towards decarbonisation with heat consumption deriving from 
black liquors and electrification of some processes, which leads to a reduction in energy intensity of -23% to -28% by 2050 
compared to 2005.

LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
The sector is also expected to diversify its production, e.g. through a focus on bio-refineries, although at present the cost of 
technologies such as the Fischer-Tropsch process does not yet make them cost effective.
4.1.3.8 Other industries
There is an increase in the industry associated with the manufacture of computer, communication, electronics and optical equipment; 
pharmaceutical products; electrical equipment and other industries with high technological potential. The increasing use of robots 
contributes such that 70% of the demand for energy services in the sector is associated with machinery, compared to the 32% 
estimated today. Decarbonisation is due to increased electrification, which replaces petroleum products, and the use of solar heating 
for low and medium temperature heat generation.
4.1.4 Buildings - residential and services
Buildings are currently responsible for 5% of national GHG emissions. Buildings, which include the residential and service sectors, 
are major energy consumers, currently accounting for about 30% of final energy consumption, and are one of the most important 
sources of CO  emissions. In buildings, energy is consumed for the provision of energy services such as space heating and cooling, 
2
lighting, refrigeration and cooking, sanitary water heating, among others. 
Despite the expected increase in demand for cooling services, due to rising average temperatures, and for other electrical uses 
associated with servers, clouds, etc., these sectors still show high potential for reducing emissions, which will already start to be 
felt over the next two decades. 
Thus, emissions reductions are estimated for 2050 in the residential sector at -97% and -96% and 100% in the services sector 
(compared to 2005), with the incorporation of renewable energy in heating and cooling to be 66% and 68%.

In the residential and service sector, an increase is expected in residential thermal comfort, both in heating and cooling (by 2050, 
thermal comfort will triple in heating and double in cooling compared to the current situation). This increase in comfort comes from 
the continued trend of electrification in the sector (electricity is already the main energy vector today), the use of more efficient 
equipment (e.g. heat pumps), the increased use of insulation materials and higher rates of urban rehabilitation (e.g. replacement of 
windows). Insulation measures are estimated to reduce heating energy consumption by 26% by 2040 and around 50% by 2050 in 
the residential sector, so this increase in comfort does not result in a direct increase in final energy consumption.
A continued focus on urban rehabilitation will provide the opportunity for the incorporation of improvements in energy and water 
efficiency, the incorporation of low carbon materials and renewable energy sources, contributing to the fight against energy poverty.
A sharing economy contributes to a lower possession rate of some equipment 
- relocation of the demand to services (e.g. laundry, kitchen). On the other hand, 
increased working from home involves increased use of air conditioning, lighting and 
other equipment - relocation of demand to the residence.

NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
In 2050 there is also the possibility of a decrease in energy consumption per m2 in residential buildings from -7% to -20% 
compared to today, explained by the adoption of high-performance electrical equipment such as LEDs for lighting and equipment 
of higher energetic efficiency classes. 
Natural gas remains an option in housing in the time horizon until 2040, virtually disappearing over the following decade. Biomass 
usage options follow the same trend, although their importance is different in urban and rural areas (more decentralised). 
Particularly in the services sector, there is a prospect of extensive electrification accompanied by solar heating for water heating 
and the predominance of heat pumps for heating spaces, these being the most cost-effective options for decarbonising buildings

The perspective of net zero energy buildings and Positive Energy Districts (PED) 
are aspects that will mark the future of buildings. A range of opportunities can be 
anticipated around these concepts, not only of an energy and digital technology 
base, but of new business models, integrated into the broader concept of smart 
cities.
Another factor to consider in buildings is the adoption of nature-based solutions 
that can partially coat the envelope of buildings, and that can contribute to alter 
the building’s energy balance. Also, urban farming, whether on the rooftops or in 
the basements of buildings using hydroponic and aeroponic systems, seems to 
be a trend in cities with a positive impact on their energy performance.
Increasingly, building management models focus not only on the building itself, 
but on the local system in which it is situated, with a positive impact, whether 
through the possibility of own production, or shared consumption and locally 
based business models, integrating energy and other resources, such as water 
and food production. These aspects are important for shaping the future of 
residential and service buildings, especially in cities.

4.2. ROLE OF AGRICULTURE, FORESTS AND OTHER LAND USES IN THE TRANSITION TO 
CARBON NEUTRALITY
 
In 2015, GHG emissions from agriculture represent about 10% of national emissions, totalling 6.8 Mt CO , and mainly involve 
2
methane (CH4), corresponding to 40% of national emissions of this gas, and nitrous oxide (N2O) which in this case represents 73 
% of the total national emissions of this gas. The most important emission sources originate from the animal sector, and represent 
83% of agricultural emissions (enteric fermentation, livestock effluent management, direct manure spreading on pastures and 
application of livestock effluents on agricultural lands). The remaining 17% refer to the use of mineral fertilisers, lime correctors and 
crop residues not removed from agricultural lands.
Emissions from agriculture have been increasing since 2013, mainly as a result of the increase in livestock numbers, particularly 
non-dairy cattle. 
The component associated with agricultural and pasture uses in 2015 represented about 0.7 Mt CO e of emissions, resulting from 
2
the kinds of practices used and the conversions between the different use categories to these categories over the last 20 years. 
Considering this component, thus associating all activities and impacts on the land of this sector, agricultural emissions in 2015 
represented 11% of total emissions.
The component of land uses associated with forest occupation are normally large carbon sinks. This is how, in 2015, forest lands 
obtained a net sequestration of 11 Mt CO e. However, in the Portuguese case, this carbon sink potential is greatly affected by 
2
the impact of rural fires, which reveals itself directly in net GHG emissions when they are large fires, and indirectly in decisions 
to maintain or change the land use, by the farmers. Other land uses (urban areas, wetlands or swamps) are generally sources of 
emissions, which results in a positive carbon sequestration balance of around 9 Mt in 2015. 
The evolution of emissions associated with agriculture and forests is highly dependent on the introduction of structural changes 
and the types of management used. The evolution of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is one of them. The current proposal 
seeks more effective climate action and better protection of the environment and biodiversity by the agricultural sector. In order to 
bring about reductions in emissions and increase sequestration, there should be a focus on a green scheme that translates into 
more equitable payments to farmers, oriented towards the environment, climate change and the country. Also, there is potential 
for achieving emissions reductions in the livestock sector, through improvements in feed digestibility and the livestock effluent 
management systems.
The contribution of biodiverse pastures is very important for net sequestration associated with agricultural land uses in 2050, and 
the expansion of biological and conservation farming and precision agriculture will allow a reduction of emissions associated with 
animal effluents and fertiliser use.
In the forests, a reduction in the annual average burned area should be given prominence, through improvements in land 
management and planning and greater investment in the management of stands, in particular in fire prevention and fighting. New 
afforestation and reforestation are mostly implemented with production species (cork oak, pine and eucalyptus) or with protection 
and conservation species (native hardwoods), depending on the scenario considered.
52RNC2050

Also, in the context of the definition and implementation of investment support policies, it is recommended to reinforce the distribution 
of support for ecosystem services and the maintenance of forest biodiversity.

LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
It should be noted that emissions reduction in agriculture is occurring at a slower rate than in other sectors, inherent to the 
characteristics of the associated biophysical systems, which means that its weight in national emissions will be between 29% and 
34% by 2050, depending on whether one considers or not the contribution of land uses. 
Below are details of the decarbonisation vectors for agriculture and forests, which will have a net sequestration role in 2050.
EMISSION REDUCTION IN LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION AND PASTURES 
For the reduction of emissions in livestock production and pastures (enteric fermentation, effluent management, spreading manure 
on pastures, organic matter in pastures), a fundamental contribution will be made by changes in the numbers of the various species, 
the animal diet and the digestibility of the animal feed, the animal manure and effluent management systems used in intensive 
livestock and increased organic matter content in the land used for pasture.
The changes in the animal diet and feed digestibility will make livestock farming more efficient and reduce the emissions per head, 
notably by changing the specific composition of the pasture and forage, by increasing the fat content of the feed used and/or the 
use of food additives, productivity improvements through genetics and the increased use of supplements in the feed. 
The changes in the animal manure and effluent management systems used in intensive livestock will be marked by the progressive 
shift from systems with more emissions (e.g. anaerobic lagoons) to systems with lower emission factors (e.g. tanks and composting).
The adoption of these kinds of livestock management practices and changes has the potential to reduce emissions by -177 kt CO e 
2
in 2030, -374 ktCO e in 2040 and -564 ktCO e in 2050.
2 2
Not less important, it will be necessary to ensure an increase in the organic matter content of the land area used for pasture, 
focusing in particular on areas with sown, improved, permanent and biodiverse pastures in order to increase their sequestration 
capacity. This will require an increase of around 400% in the area of biodiverse pastures compared to 2005 (from 50,000 ha to 
250,000 ha) resulting in net sequestration of 0.76 Mt in 2050, and there is potential for this in Portugal.
EMISSION REDUCTION IN CROP PRODUCTION AND AGRICULTURAL LAND
To reduce emissions in crop production and agricultural land (use of fertilisers, organic materials in agricultural soils) a fundamental 
contribution will be made by changes in the total agricultural area and the area of different crops, the replacement of mineral 
fertilisation by organic fertilisation, a reduction of the total amounts of fertiliser used and an increase in the organic material content 
of agricultural lands.
Changes in the total agricultural area and in the area of different crops will mainly be due to the opening of agricultural markets 
to countries outside the EU, with consequences for the production of the crops for which the country has the most competitive 
advantages, such as vegetables, dried and fresh fruits and olives.
54RNC2050
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
Replacing mineral fertilisers with organic fertilisers will increase the use of compost from livestock waste and/or organic waste 
from other sources (e.g. agribusiness). Replacement with organic fertilisers, especially composting, is expected to reach 180,000 
ha by 2050. On the other hand, it is also estimated that the total amount of fertiliser used per unit area will be reduced through the 
expansion and development of precision agriculture techniques, totalling 300,000 ha in 2050, which will lead to a 58% reduction 
in the use of synthetic nitrogen compared to 2005. 
Finally, it will be necessary to ensure an increase in the organic matter content of agricultural lands and a consequent increase in 
sequestering capacity, notably by increasing the area under conservation (or regenerative) agriculture, reaching 180,000ha by 2050 
and by increasing the area under biological farming and/or replacement of mineral fertilisation with organic fertilisation. 
All these measures will lead to total reductions of -177 ktCO e in 2030, -331 ktCO e in 2040 and -639 ktCO e in 2050.

REDUCED EMISSIONS AND INCREASED SEQUESTRATION IN FORESTS AND OTHER LAND USES
In 2015, forests sequestered 11 Mt CO e. For the reduction of emissions and increase of forest sequestration and other land 
2
uses, a fundamentally contribution will be made by a big reduction in burned areas and the use given to these areas after the fire, 
improvements in forest management and consequent increases in average productivity, the rate of new afforestation (expansion of 
the forest area from other land uses) and the expansion rate of other land uses.
It will therefore be necessary to ensure a large reduction in burned areas, from an average of about 164,000 ha/year between 1998 
and 2017 to 70,000 ha/year by 2050 (i.e. a 60% reduction), to be careful about the use given to these areas after the fire, ensuring 
smaller total areas affected by fires, considering the suitability of the species used in reforestation, reducing the deforestation 
caused by fires (forests converted into scrubland) and making greater use of fire prevention techniques, including increased use of 
small ruminants to reduce combustible material.
On the other hand, there is a series of actions that will allow improvement of forest management and achieve consequent increases 
in average productivity, such as improving management and increasing fire prevention, using more productive and better adapted 
varieties and increasing density, of either production or protection species.
Finally, it will be necessary to increase the rate of new afforestation to 8,000 ha/year (expansion of the forest area from other land 
uses) and to reduce the rate of expansion of other land uses, particularly from urbanised areas, flooded areas (including dams) and 
scrubland.

4.3. ROLE OF WASTE AND WASTEWATER IN THE TRANSITION TO CARBON NEUTRALITY  
GHG emissions from this sector originate from solid waste and wastewater treatment systems (urban and industrial in nature). 
Energy recovery from waste is considered in the energy sector and only incineration of waste without energy recovery is included 
in this sector.
The waste and wastewater sector accounted for about 9% of total emissions in 2015, with landfill disposal representing the largest 
share of GHG emissions (76%), followed by wastewater treatment. (23%), with emissions from biological treatment of municipal 
waste and incineration below 1%. Since 2005 there has been a continuous and consistent reduction in GHG emissions from waste 
and wastewater.
One of the particular characteristics of emissions from the waste and wastewater sector is the dominant importance of methane 
emissions in total GHGs, accounting for 88% of the sector’s emissions in 2015. The sector’s contribution to national methane 
emissions is 57%. 
These methane emissions are linked to the anaerobic decomposition processes of organic matter present in both waste and 
wastewater, so reducing GHG emissions in this sector will mean reducing the weight of methane emissions related to anaerobic 
fermentation processes.
Emissions from Urban Waste (UW) landfills result from the slow degradation of organic waste present in the UW, which continue 
to produce GHG, and it is assumed that half of the biogas volume released during this process corresponds to methane, until the 
amount of fermentable carbon in them is depleted, which occurs over several years. Thus, annual emissions depend not only on the 
organic waste deposited each year, but on the accumulated waste over several decades. Therefore, to achieve significant reductions 
by 2050, a rapid reduction of landfilling with new organic waste is essential, especially in the next 5 to 10 years.
A reduction of the production of UW per capita and landfilling of only 10% of the UW produced in 2035, as a result of national and 
Community targets, will lead to a reduction of -82% of UW landfill in that year, compared to current values.
By 2050, the amount of waste generated per capita should be further reduced; gradually increasing separated collection of 
recyclable waste, reaching 65% in 2035, including bio-waste; and greatly reducing the amount of landfilled waste (-60% and -85% 
of organic waste compared to 2005), which will lead to a significant reduction in landfill emissions by -79% to -82% by 2050, 
compared to 2005.
In 2050 there will also be a significant reduction in GHG emissions from wastewater, from -77% to -78%, compared to 2005. 
As a consequence of these GHG emissions reductions and considering that wastewater and landfills generate most emissions 
within the waste and wastewater sector, it is concluded that there will be a sharp decrease in GHG emissions in this sector in 2050, 
between - 77% to - 80% compared to 2005.

Part of the methane produced by landfills can be recovered and burned with energy recovery, which is an emissions reduction 
measure. The methane recovery rate is therefore expected to increase from the current 32% to 44%, allowing a significant 
reduction in these emissions by 2050. Indeed, if, on the one hand, there will be less methane production, on the other hand the 
relative percentage of recovery of methane versus the methane generated will be increasing. As a result, efficiency improvements 
in this area could constitute significant reductions in methane emissions.

There is also a downward trend in the quantities of UW produced, either by a reduction of the population or by a reduction in 
production per capita from 8% to 24% by 2050 (compared to 2015) depending on the scenario considered.
Separated collection of bio-waste and the consequent increase in biological treatment systems are expected. The reduction in GHG 
emissions will be greater the greater the reduction in municipal waste production per capita, the greater the reduction in food waste 
and increase in local composting solutions, resulting from greater assumed circularity.
Developments in the wastewater, urban and industrial waste sector are not significant compared to the current value, which is 
already quite favourable for the population served by drainage systems and secondary treatment systems. 
As already mentioned with regard to biogas recovery in landfills, the production and recovery of biogas generated in anaerobic 
digestion sludge treatment systems is of significant importance in the context of emissions from the domestic wastewater treatment 
sector, although in significantly lower quantities, with around 14,000 tonnes of methane produced in both 2015 and 2050.

4.4. ROLE OF THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY IN THE TRANSITION TO CARBON NEUTRALITY
 
The circular economy is a fundamental and structuring element of the transition that underpins the trajectories of carbon neutrality 
of the Portuguese economy. Thus, it was considered an integral part of the narrative of the socioeconomic scenarios developed and 
was reflected in the sectoral assumptions that support the modelling of GHG emissions.
The role of the circular economy has been the subject of greater scrutiny in the context of the value chain of a number of sectors 
considered to be important for the success of the neutrality objective and for which an important impact of circularity is envisaged 
- mobility, agri-food, forestry activities, construction and waste.
In the Mobility sector, the transitions induced by the circular economy point to lower use of individual transport and growth in 
multimodal shared integrated mobility services (at both public and private transport levels) and greater fairness in access to mobility 
services and an increase in the occupancy rate of cars. 
Thus, new business models emerge that replace the supply of goods (vehicles) with the provision of services and ownership through 
use.
On the other hand, increasing supply chain digitisation (more online shopping, more reverse logistics) increases demand for goods 
mobility, as well as increasing the pressure on this sector and, as a counterbalance, it is necessary to increase the load factor of 
light and heavy goods vehicles, the fleet’s autonomy and its technological replacement rate, thereby improving the efficiency of the 
vehicles (for passenger and goods, light and heavy).
These concerns allow us to have more competitive business models, with lower operating costs and less impact on GHG emissions.
Potentially, the circular economy could lead to a reduction of GHG emissions from the transport and mobility sector of -4%|-25% 
by 2050.
In the agri-food sector, the adoption of regenerative and more resource-efficient agricultural practices (water and energy) and new 
food consumption habits and lifestyles (e.g. greater nutritional suitability of the diet; urban and peri-urban production; and local 
supply, particularly of vegetables; bulk purchases) promote a reduction of waste production and its organic portion (via reduced food 
waste), as well as reducing emissions.
The expansion of biological and conservation farming and precision agriculture, as well as permanent pastures, will reduce 
emissions associated with fertiliser use and animal effluents, and increase carbon sequestration resulting from increases in organic 
matter content in the soil. In addition, other environmental benefits are induced, such as the preservation of natural and ecological 
resources, promotion of biodiversity and/or improvements in animal welfare.
The use of compost to replace the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers is also a circularity measure to be considered in this sector.
These circularity strategies lead to a reduction in GHG emissions from the agricultural sector between -16%|-37% by 2050.
In the forest sector, the increase in active afforestation, the promotion of more efficient forestry practices in the use of resources 
and risk management, and the valorisation of ecosystem services, leverage and sustain a growing role for the bioeconomy, with an 
impact on carbon retention and on the net balance of emissions.
63RNC2050
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
Future productivity gains may arise from better forest management practices and less fire losses, as forest area expansion is 
expected to be limited by 2050 (which means a reduction in forest area relative to 2015).
The forest sector is a value chain that already has a high degree of circularity, and forests play an inevitable role in achieving carbon 
neutrality. Thus, it can be seen that investment in forests to increase biological carbon sequestration could lead to gains of over 40% 
by 2050 (compared to a non-circular scenario). 
In construction, increased urban rehabilitation, with the reuse of construction components, reclaimed or recycled materials, and the 
use of “empty” built public spaces, passive buildings with a zero energy balance (NZB: Net Zero Energy Buildings), multifunctional 
and shared buildings with reduced built area, as well as the use of new, more sophisticated, more energy efficient and durable 
materials, and of renewable materials with a smaller carbon footprint (e.g. wood and cork) are circularity strategies to be pursued. 
In the waste sector, circularity strategies make it possible to reduce per capita waste production and its organic portion, mainly by 
reducing food waste and the use of plastics, with the prospect of increasing biomass collection (giving priority to biological treatment 
with compost production), increased multi-material separated collection and development of recycling chains and the elimination 
of disposal of municipal waste in landfills.
The circular economy can lead to a reduction in GHG emissions from waste management (including energy recovery from municipal 
waste) of -69% to -72% by 2050.

4.5. CO-BENEFITS OF CARBON NEUTRALITY FOR AIR QUALITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH
 
GHGs do not have a direct effect on the health of humans or ecosystems. However, many of the processes that emit GHG are 
also responsible for emissions of other air pollutants that cause other environmental problems, such as degradation of air quality, 
acidification and eutrophication, causing damage to ecosystems with the consequent loss of biodiversity. and human health 
problems, particularly respiratory and cardiovascular problems.
Nowadays air pollution is one of the greatest environmental health risks, and the World Health Organisation identifies particulate 
matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NO, NO  and NO ), sulphur oxides. (SO  and SO ) and tropospheric ozone (O3) as the most harmful 
2 3 2 3
air pollutants. Ozone, unlike other pollutants, is not emitted directly, but is a pollutant that forms in the atmosphere in the presence 
of other pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides.
PM originates from a variety of sources, but mainly from burning fossil fuels, and is the most harmful pollutant. The smaller these 
particles are, the more likely they are to penetrate deep into the respiratory tract and the greater the risk of inducing negative effects. 
Smaller inhalable particles (PM10 and PM2.5) reach the lungs and the finest, PM2.5, can even enter the bloodstream.
Nitrogen oxides mainly come from road traffic. In big cities, they are primarily responsible for the poor quality of the air. Sulphur 
oxides do not presently pose a serious air quality problem, as a result of various measures such as, for example, reducing the 
sulphur content of fossil fuels.
In Portugal, notwithstanding the improvement in recent years, air quality problems still persist in some places, notably in densely 
populated urban areas where concentrations are frequently seen to exceed some human health thresholds for nitrogen dioxide 
(NO2) and PM10. There are also areas where values above the long-term ozone target often occur.
Climate change, by affecting weather conditions, including the frequency of heatwaves and periods of high atmospheric stability, will 
tend to prolong periods when ozone levels are high and may lead to increased concentrations of PM, contributing to the degradation 
of air quality and increasing the risk of diseases associated with air pollution. It is estimated that 6,000 people die prematurely each 
year in Portugal due to air pollution.
A sound air quality policy is the answer to a legitimate claim of citizens in terms of health and well-being, preventing premature 
deaths, and bringing economic benefits from improved productivity, reduced external health costs and offers, in a circular economy 
context, opportunities for technologies and services.
The decarbonisation vectors will have an impact on economic activities and consequently on the generation of air pollutant 
emissions, and it is therefore expected that the goal of carbon neutrality will bring the co-benefit of improved air quality, with positive 
effects on human health, in particular as regards respiratory diseases. This effect will be particularly significant in cities due to the 
transformation that will take place in terms of mobility, with the emphasis on public transport, decarbonisation of the fleets and the 
increase in active, shared and sustainable multimodal mobility, as well as electric mobility and other zero emission technologies;

Positive ecosystem impacts are also expected, where air pollution pressures hinder vegetation growth and cause damage to 
agriculture and biodiversity.
On the other hand, the increase in biomass consumption for electricity production and industrial processes is seen as a trade-off 
for air quality, with a possible impact on the increase of emissions from non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and 
fine particles (PM2.5).
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report on the impacts of 1.5 ºC global warming, ensuring this 
limit will have the practical consequence of significantly reducing the risks and impacts of climate change. While it is undeniable 
that climate change impacts are already taking place on a global scale, the only manner to vary the degree to which they will be felt 
in the future is to achieve significantly reduced emissions globally.

CONTRIBUTING TO NATIONAL RESILIENCE AND CAPACITY TO ADAPT 
TO CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITIES AND IMPACTS
According to the European Commission9 1total economic losses resulting from meteorological and other extreme weather events in 
Europe between 1980 and 2016 amounted to over EUR 436 billion, and in Portugal this figure was around EUR 7 billion. Coastal 
regions could suffer economic losses of about EUR 39 billion a year by 2050 and up to EUR 960 billion a year near the end of the 
century. 
In Portugal, damage from extreme weather events has been felt in coastal erosion, storms, rural fires and drought. The cost of the 
severe storms that have been experienced in recent years, such as the Hercules storm that struck the country in 2014, amounted to 
about 17 million euros and the cost related to the March 2018 storms on the Portuguese coast are estimated at approximately 1.4 
million euros. The amounts associated with other weather events were around 60-140 million euros a year, associated with rural 
fires (not counting the 2017 fires). The drought in 2005 had an estimated cost of around 290 million euros and the 2012 drought 
brought losses mainly in terms of agricultural production shortfalls, with estimated costs of over 200 million euros10, 2fand a figure 
for the most recent drought (2017-18) still has to be calculated. 
It is also important to note that climate impacts will be unevenly distributed at a European level. Southern European countries have 
greater vulnerabilities and fewer opportunities with climate change, compared to the other subregions of the European continent, 
and will suffer more from the effects of heat-related human mortality, water restrictions, loss of habitats, energy requirements for 
cooling and rural fires.
The  PESETA II11,  project, which aims to increase knowledge about regional and sectoral patterns of climate change in Europe by 
the end of the century, effectively concludes that economic losses associated with climate change impacts have a very asymmetrical 
geographical distribution, with a clear bias towards the southern European regions. For example, in a scenario in which the average 
temperature rises by 2 °C by the end of the century, the study concludes that welfare losses in terms of GDP range from 0.2% in 
the Northern European region to 3% for Southern Europe for the last third of this century.
The national effort to reduce emissions, as part of a broader global action framework, will help to allow adaptation costs to be 
reduced significantly, with clear economic savings.
With a view precisely to emphasising the implementation of adaptation measures and mobilising the various current financial 
instruments and shaping the framework for those in the future, the Climate Change Adaptation Action Program (P-3AC) with a 2030 
time horizon, has been prepared, defining the priority intervention areas in response to the main vulnerabilities and impacts of the 
climate changes identified for our country:

1.  Increased frequency and intensity of rural fires
2.  Increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves
3.  Increased frequency and intensity of periods of drought and water scarcity
4.  Increased susceptibility to desertification
5.  Increased maximum temperature
6.  Increased frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events
7.  Higher sea levels
8.  Increased frequency and intensity of extreme phenomena that cause coastal removal and erosion
It should be noted that there is a series of decarbonisation measures and options with clear synergies in adapting to the effects of 
climate change, such as, for example, measures contributing to forest and agricultural sequestration (increasing soil organic matter 
and its water retention capacity, combating desertification), natural-based solutions (installing roofs and other green infrastructures 
in urban areas, renaturalisation of impermeable areas, etc.) but also measures in the area of energy efficiency, as they contribute 
to reducing total energy consumption and thereby reduce the vulnerability of the energy system to pressures arising from extreme 
events. 
On the other hand, the impacts of climate change should be taken into account in mitigation options, notably as regards future water 
availability, heating and cooling needs and the risk of rural fires. For example, the scenarios analysed under RNC2050 accommodate 
the decreasing availability of water for electricity production expected in the RCP 4.5 climate scenario. In this context, it has been 
estimated that water production will, on average, decrease by 9% by 2050, compared to 2020, considering, in particular, a hydraulic 
index of 0.8.
In this regard, it is also particularly important to note that the determining factor in forest carbon sink capacity - a decrease in the 
annual average burned area - will be hampered in a scenario of worsening of the effects of climate change.
It is therefore undeniable that the implementation of adaptation measures becomes one of the critical factors for the carbon neutrality 
targets, as regards both emissions reduction and sequestration capacity. Similarly, carbon neutrality is one of the guarantors of 
adaptability, as it will only be possible if CO  levels in the atmosphere do not exceed a certain threshold, beyond which adaptation 
2
is no longer possible and society as we know it will cease to exist. The synergies for mitigation and adaptation that occur in various 
measures are another sign that integrated action between the two strands in all components of society is effectively needed.

STIMULATING RESEARCH, INNOVATION AND KNOWLEDGE 
PRODUCTION 
Research, innovation and knowledge production are key to the process of defining sound policies and adapting to climate change. 
The participation of science takes place at the most diverse levels:
•	 by monitoring and tracking climate change and modelling future climate change and its impacts;
•	 by accurately estimating the emission or sequestration levels that each process or sector produces and the monitoring 
and follow-up of these emissions over time, while also considering new important sectors or areas, in line with the 
development of scientific knowledge, according to the IPCC guidelines for developing production processes or new 
technologies that lead to a strong reduction in emissions or a strong increase in sequestration;
•	 by developing dissemination strategies and/or business models that allow the transfer of the best technologies and their 
adoption by economic sectors and households;
•	 by ex ante and ex post evaluation of policies and measures and their effectiveness in reducing emissions, and in their 
environmental dimension, but also by assessing their economic impact on employment and prediction of the sectors or 
territories affected positively and negatively by these policies;
•	 by designing incentive systems that facilitate the adoption of less emitting practices and technologies or of disincentive 
policies that deter the continuation or adoption of more emitting practices;
•	 by identifying long-term decarbonisation strategies and vectors for carbon neutrality.
In turn, the process of defining carbon neutrality trajectories informs the science agenda about the areas, sectors and technologies 
for which the identification of decarbonisation solutions is most significant, and therefore most effective, and/or that are the areas 
in which decarbonisation is now more conditioned or less cost-effective and therefore more difficult to achieve.
70RNC2050
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
It is also important to ensure a connection between research, development and innovation and the production system, enabling the 
development of real-world prototypes and pilot projects and, in a second phase, accelerating the transfer of this knowledge to the 
production system and/or the households, to ensure that the decisions taken at any given time are those best suited to the goal of 
decarbonisation, but also those that lead to the best results in terms of job creation and value for society.
Therefore it is important to promote the science and knowledge of climate change at a national level, to stimulate research 
and development of low carbon technologies, practices, products and services that contribute to climate change mitigation and 
adaptation, and above all to promote eco-innovation. It is also crucial to develop a climate change knowledge base that supports 
public policy decision-making in this area and facilitates public education and knowledge transfer.
The Research and Innovation thematic agendas of the Science and Technology Foundation, I.P. for Climate Change, circular economy, 
sustainable energy systems, urban Science and Industry and cities of the future are precursors of the mobilisation needed to ensure 
the transition to a carbon neutral society.

GUARANTEE FINANCING CONDITIONS AND INCREASE INVESTMENT 
LEVELS
7.1. INVESTMENT
Maintaining the competitive dynamics of the national economy against a backdrop of major trends such as digitisation, decentralisation 
and decarbonisation, but where the role of the circular economy and resource use efficiency, as well as demography, are also felt, 
this will soon lead to a significant volume of investment over a considered timeframe, making it possible to achieve significant 
emission reductions (around 65% compared to 2005 in 2050), but still far from the objective of carbon neutrality.
Part of this investment will always occur because it is a result of the normal functioning of the market economy, accompanied by 
appropriate public policies. Given the technological upgrades and the expected evolution of their costs, it can be foreseen that the 
‘replacement’ of technologies will be a replacement with different characteristics (e.g. diesel vehicles will not be replaced by other 
diesel vehicles but by electric vehicles or by new forms of mobility). 
Carbon neutrality and energy transition will encourage a deeper and faster transformation of society, more focused on less emitting 
technologies, with consequences for multiple aspects of the economy, the citizens’ daily life and social organisation. Thus, the 
investment attributable to the objective of carbon neutrality is only a fraction of the overall investment that the Portuguese economy 
will have to make over time in order to remain competitive.
This transformation will have to be accompanied by a significant investment, which will take place in all sectors of society, and 
will, according to its type, be shared between investments by households (e.g. efficient household appliances, electric cars, home 
insulation, etc.), by companies (e.g. renewable energy sources, hydrogen trucks, electric furnaces and boilers, etc.) and by the State 
(e.g. electric public transport, decarbonisation of public buildings and the fleet, etc.). The private sector and households will be 
responsible for the vast majority of these investments.
The state will always play a key role in shaping and adapting the regulatory, tax and incentive system that will provide clear long-
term signals to facilitate the necessary investments and avoid obsolete assets.
The overall aggregate amount of investment by 2050 will be close to EUR 1 trillion - of which around EUR 930 billion will be realised 
in any case as a result of the normal dynamics of modernisation of the economy, catalysed by ongoing policies to ensure the 
functioning of the energy system - which translates into an annualised value of EUR 27 to 29 billion.
72RNC2050
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
The additional investment needed to achieve carbon neutrality will be around EUR 85 billion for the entire period, i.e. around EUR 
2.1 to € 2.5 billion per year (around 1.2% of GDP). In addition to the reduction of emissions that, in the energy system, increases 
from 70% to 90%, this investment will also lead to substantial energy efficiency gains and reduced energy dependence, which will 
have major (positive) implications for reduction of the energy bill.

In the power generation sector, the end of fossil fuels and the increase in demand caused by the growing electrification of the 
economy will dictate the need to make significant investments in increasing renewable capacity and, as existing renewable capacity 
reaches the end of its useful life, in its replacement (part of the country’s existing wind and solar capacity reaches the end of its 
useful life before 2050 and will have to be replaced by new capacity). In this sector, it is anticipated that more than half of the 
required investment will be for the installation of solar capacity, more focused in a first phase on centralised solar plants and in a 
second phase on decentralised production (e.g. roofs of residential and service buildings) of photovoltaic energy. There will also 
be significant investments in wind power, very much focused on onshore wind power (wind turbines installed on land) and the 
introduction, in the second half of this period, of offshore wind power (wind turbines installed on ocean platforms). In the case of 
industry, investments will be associated with the energy transition, highlighting the focus on energy efficiency and electrification, 
namely with the adoption of electric furnaces and boilers.
75RNC2050
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
The mobility and transport sector will be one of those that will have greater technological substitution and will be the sector that 
concentrates about 40% of the investment. This level of investment is associated with a major transformation of the passenger car 
fleet and the vehicles used for heavy passenger or freight transport. This high level of investment is due both to the imperative of 
reducing emissions and the relatively short useful life of the assets involved. In this context, the purchase of light passenger cars 
powered by electricity and heavy transport (goods and heavy vehicles) powered by electricity or hydrogen will be important.
In the residential and service building sector, most of the investment will be related to the renovation and replacement of electrical 
equipment with more efficient equipment, being low cost but very important equipment, and therefore requiring significant 
investment. Also of note is the need for substantial investments in building insulation, which will simultaneously increase thermal 
comfort and reduce the need for heating in the winter and cooling in summer, and the use of heat pumps, which are the most 
efficient way to provide this heating/cooling service. It is also noted that, due to climate change itself, these needs are likely to be 
aggravated by 2050, with predictable increases mainly in summer cooling needs.
In agriculture and forests, the reduction in emissions and increase in sequestration will be dependent on a significant reduction in 
burned areas and a range of other measures such as precision agriculture, conservation farming, biological farming and the use 
of composting, which will allow a reduction in emissions from synthetic fertilisers and their replacement with organic fertilisers, 
a reduction in emissions from livestock systems by increasing the quality of the diet and installing biodiverse pastures and by 
increasing sequestration through active afforestation and increases in average forest productivity. The overall amount of additional 
investments in some of the technologies identified, which can lead to reductions in fertiliser emissions and increases in sequestration 
on agricultural land, pastures and forests, amounts to around EUR 570 million over the period 2021-2050, equivalent to an annual 
amount of around 19 million euros.

LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
The nature of the waste and wastewater sector, in particular its importance as a public service, and existing and foreseeable 
environmental constraints on its future operation and performance, establishes an investment effort that has much more to do 
with regulation of the sector and existing environmental regulations and much less to do with measures to combat climate change.
In a very important way, the former compete for the fundamental objectives of the latter. For example, in the case of industrial 
wastewater, the effort to reduce GHG emissions involves generalising the secondary treatment of organic effluents.
This guidance has very positive consequences in terms of GHG emissions, and it seems distorted to refer to this investment effort 
as being for decarbonisation when it actually follows a trend of the first generation of environmental measures. On the other hand, 
the continuity of infrastructures, in particular with regard to existing buildings, drainage networks and treatment or final destination 
infrastructures, leads us to believe more in the maintenance of paradigms and continuous evolution than in disruptive technological 
changes in the sector. Moreover, the circular economy and organic load generation measures (for example, the reduction of unit 
production of organic waste and food waste) are very difficult to calculate and cannot be attributed, directly and mostly, to the 
policies and measures to combat climate change.
It is in this sense that it was considered that the mention and analysis of costs associated with the waste and wastewater sector is 
not important in the context of the objectives of RNC2050.
7.2 SAVINGS ON FOSSIL FUEL IMPORTS 
 
The transition to a carbon neutral economy will be supported by increased use of endogenous renewable energy sources, which will 
reduce energy dependence from abroad from the current 78% to figures below 20%.
In 2015, Portugal consumed about 704 PJ of coal, natural gas and petroleum products. These fuels are either entirely imported 
(oil, coal and natural gas) or produced from imported raw materials (diesel, petrol, among others). With the achievement of a carbon 
neutral economy, this energy consumption will be reduced by about 90% by 2050 compared to 2015. 
Purchasing these fuels is an important cost for the Portuguese economy and one of the factors that most penalises the Portuguese 
trade balance. In 2015, it represented more than 35% of the import balance of the balance of trade. 
Carbon neutrality will thus allow substantial savings on the purchase of fossil fuels on international markets, with the estimated 
savings compared with consumption in 2015 exceeding the costs as of 2035. 
Cumulative overall savings in the period 2020-2050 amount to around EUR 43 billion, which translates into an annualised amount 
of EUR 1.2 billion (about 0.6% of GDP). The additional savings with carbon neutrality amount to about EUR 10 billion for the whole 
period, or about EUR 275 million per year (about 0.1% of GDP).

The energy transition based on endogenous renewable energy sources represents, in the case of an open economy that is still 
heavily dependent on fossil fuel imports as the national economy is now, an important opportunity to reduce energy dependency 
and redirect resources that are currently used to purchase fossil fuels - and thus leave the national economy - for investment in 
the economy.

7.3. FINANCING
Financing the transition to a circular, carbon neutral society, in its many aspects, is crucial to the success of the national goal of 
achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.
 To this end, it is necessary to ensure that climate policy is financed in a sustainable manner and that it is implemented efficiently, 
equitably and in line with the country’s long-term objectives, avoiding financing investments that are not in line with this objective 
and enhancing the creation of new clusters in the country. It is therefore important to foster the development of a favourable 
environment for sustainable financing12 and greater involvement of the financial system.

12 According to the European Commission’s action plan, ‘sustainable financing’ generally means ‘a process by which environmental and social considerations are properly integrated 
into investment decisions, leading to increased investment in sustainable and long-term activities’. More specifically, environmental issues are related to climate change mitigation and 
adaptation, as well as to the wider environment and related risks (e.g. natural disasters). The term ‘social considerations’ covers issues of inequality, inclusiveness, labour relations, 
investment in human capital and communities. Social and environmental considerations are often intertwined, as climate change in particular can exacerbate existing systems that promote 
inequality. The governance of public and private institutions, including issues such as their management structures, labour relations or executive compensation, will have a key role to play 
in ensuring that social and environmental considerations are included in the decision-making process.”

LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
Tax policy should also be aligned with the defined neutrality objective, giving the right signals to the economy, internalising 
externalities, influencing behaviour change and at the same time allowing the generation of public revenues that can be applied in 
decarbonisation measures and to ensure a fair transition. Green taxation should therefore be pursued with the aim of obtaining a 
triple dividend, economic, social and environmental.
The investment dynamics associated with decarbonisation of the economy and energy transition also provide an opportunity for 
innovation in the financial sector with the creation of new products and services linked to this new green economy, especially green 
bonds, green loans, sustainable investment funds and impact funds. 
On the other hand, the financial sector should progressively incorporate environmental, social and governance factors into risk 
analysis, in order to minimise the risks arising from the exposure of its portfolios to projects and assets that, in the transition to 
neutrality paradigm, may become obsolete. These approaches contribute to reducing the risks associated with an investment and 
attracting new kinds of clients.
It is also important to mention the carbon price instruments that aim to internalise the carbon price in companies’ strategic and 
operational decisions and promote the adoption by operators of lower cost measures that aim to reduce emissions. Setting a carbon 
price is one of the most cost-effective measures and a real incentive to reducing GHG emissions. A carbon price can be applied 
through a carbon tax or through an emissions trading systems, such as CELE. Portugal has participated in CELE since 2005 and 
adopted a carbon tax in 2015, in the form of an addition to the Petroleum and Energy Products Tax, subsequent to the ‘Green Tax 
Law’.
Carbon pricing policies should be fostered, particularly through effective implementation of the CELE regime, promoting actions that 
lead to reinforcement of the carbon price, encouraging widespread application of the carbon tax to sectors not covered by CELE, 
eliminating existing exemptions. It is therefore important to ensure that these funds are recycled in the decarbonisation of society, 
by setting the right signals for economic operators on the one hand and, on the other, channelling the proceeds towards investment 
in decarbonisation and development of the necessary sustainable infrastructures for the country and so that the private sector can 
leverage its activity.
Achieving the established carbon neutral objective should therefore exploit a variety of financial instruments, and it is necessary to:
•	 Align funding cycles and national public funds with the key decarbonisation drivers and energy transition, and discontinue 
investments that are not in line with this objective;
•	 Leverage and guide direct investment (national and foreign) for a future economy, aligned with the areas and objectives 
of decarbonisation and national energy transition, enhancing the creation of new clusters in the country;
•	 Make taxation a key instrument for the transition to a carbon neutral society, by benefiting clean technologies and 
removing perverse incentives for fossil fuels or investments that increase emissions;
•	 Align the financial system with the decarbonisation objectives.
In this context, it will be essential to guarantee the existence of a stable and competitive regulatory framework that ensures the 
mobilisation of public and private financial flows for implementation of the measures necessary to achieve the stated objectives, 
thereby providing investors with stability in the various sectors. 
82RNC2050
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
In this context, it will still be necessary to establish mechanisms to monitor the mobilisation of financial flows to achieve the 
objectives of this RNC2050, notably through their integration into existing reporting mechanisms for climate policy monitoring 
matters.
7.4. IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT AND GDP
 
Carbon neutrality, like any other profound transformation of society, presents both opportunities and challenges for the economy 
and employment.
In terms of opportunities, it is undeniable that there will be a positive effect on GDP and employment caused by investments for 
stimulating new sectors. Examples include investment in industrial modernisation, the circular economy, sustainable mobility and 
centralised and decentralised photovoltaic energy production. This investment with high potential for creating new business models, 
products and services, will generate wealth and employment in all the associated value chains - whether related to production, 
assembly, distribution and sale, financing, insurance, operation and maintenance, decommissioning, recycling.
However, the national total of this amount and employment will depend on the country’s ability to attract and generate investment in 
the production of such equipment and the ability to develop the supply chain of services and related activities. This refers to the early 
identification of the new activity clusters that will be created by carbon neutrality and the need for the State to create a regulatory, 
fiscal and incentive framework that fulfils two main functions: eliminate any perverse barriers and subsidies that prevent the new 
technologies from expanding or that perpetuate technologies that impede decarbonisation; and maximise and promote information 
and adoption of technologies that foster decarbonisation.
The role of the State will also be fundamental for the development of the infrastructures that will be necessary for certain technologies 
to be a reality. Examples include the challenges posed by a mostly battery-based and/or hydrogen-based mobility, especially the 
need to greatly expand the battery charging network or to design and implement new networks, such as a network for hydrogen 
supply or of overhead electric contact lines on the main roads.
Another positive aspect of carbon neutrality lies in increased investment and employment in research, innovation and development 
activities, which should cover the development or refinement of technologies that enable decarbonisation, and also the development 
of new business models and the mobilisation of families and companies to work towards the decarbonisation objectives. In the field 
of training, it is possible to anticipate new training needs for staff and workers at many levels, that are able to produce, install and 
operate these technologies. 
However, and in terms of challenges, there will be sectors that could potentially be affected by the energy transition. It is therefore 
necessary to identify in advance which sectors will be most affected and to start designing policies that create alternative opportunities 
for the affected workers and/or regions. For example, the changes in the automotive value chain due to the expansion of electric 
mobility, which must be reconverted in order to take advantage of the opportunities arising from this transition.
The economic and employment balance of carbon neutrality will therefore depend on: the wealth and employment generated by 
the opportunities of carbon neutrality; the wealth and employment that will be affected by this same neutrality; and the ability of 
Portuguese society to create new clusters.
The impact on GDP may be around 8%, compared to a scenario of stagnation of the current energy system, and an energy efficiency 
growth of only 0.1%/year, a very conservative scenario (BAU scenario).

Neutrality trajectories induce in the long term an additional positive impact in the economy, estimated at 0,5-0,9%, compared to an 
energy system that evolves to support a competitive and efficient economy, but which has not achieved neutrality (scenario without 
neutrality).

In summary, the economic modelling of these changes suggests a broadly positive impact on GDP resulting from almost total 
decarbonisation of the national energy system, leveraged by a significant growth in investment and private consumption and net 
marginal job creation. That is, carbon neutrality will be positive for Portugal overall. It should be noted that these estimates do not 
include the benefits of the climate change damage avoided and the related costs of adaptation.
In addition, it should be acknowledged that the macroeconomic modelling is based on a structure of the economy and sectoral 
relationships maintained in the long term, so using these models over extended time horizons is always a challenge and a 
very uncertain exercise. In the context of RNC2050, the uncertainty related to the 35 years of modelling is exacerbated by the 
profound change in society and relations between economic agents that will be dictated by carbon neutrality itself. This means 
that macroeconomic models capture better the losses of the sectors affected by carbon neutrality than the opportunities brought 
about by new sectors or technologies. In other words, the economic and employment impacts are probably underestimated, and the 
benefits of carbon neutrality are probably far greater than those reported.

ENSURE A FAIR AND COHESIVE TRANSITION
Climate change and the responses to this global challenge have an impact on employment and economic activities, and the Paris 
Agreement takes into account the need to safeguard a fair transition for the workforce and the creation of decent and quality jobs, 
according to each country’s development priorities. 
The transition to carbon neutrality implies a systemic transformation of the structure and operation of the current economic system 
which, at a national level, may represent more opportunities than risks. Indeed, this transformation will bring opportunities for 
new business models and the creation of new clusters with network generation, for example in the sectors related to renewable 
energy production, automation engineering or services and logistics associated with shared and autonomous mobility. Thus, the 
macroeconomic analysis developed points to marginal net job creation, in an extremely conservative scenario. 
However, job losses are also expected to occur in traditional sectors of goods and services, especially those based on energy-
intensive production and fossil-based consumption. At a national level, for example, following the commitment to abandon coal-fired 
power generation by 2030, direct impacts of energy transformation on the two coal-fired power plants can be anticipated. Proper 
management involving all the relevant actors will be critical in planning the transition and identifying specific measures to ensure a 
fair transition for the workers and communities concerned.
If, on the one hand, the large combustion plants will necessarily lose importance, it is now relatively consensual that job creation in 
renewable energy production can more than compensate for this loss of local employment. Therefore, a series of actions will have 
to be programmed to anticipate creation of the conditions and skills necessary for a fair transition, focused on professional retraining 
and requalification that will ensure the income of the populations most directly linked to the sectors in decline.
Carbon neutrality will drive the acquisition of new skills, as well as the creation of new business models. Currently in Portugal there 
are about 10,000 direct jobs linked to the renewable energy cluster, including about 3,000 in the wind cluster. The nature of the 
transition to a less concentrated system will mean greater demand for skilled, though necessarily more dispersed, labour. 
It is therefore crucial to ensure that national and European support frameworks are oriented towards research and technological 
development alongside comprehensive investment in education, professional and vocational training in line with the new paradigms 
of national business sectors that aim to (re)qualify the workforce to ensure a fair transition.

GUARANTEE  EFFECTIVE  CONDITIONS  FOR  GOVERNANCE  AND 
ENSURE  THE  INTEGRATION  OF  CARBON  NEUTRAL  OBJECTIVES  IN 
SECTORAL AREAS
In order to ensure monitoring of the transition to carbon neutrality, it will be necessary to adopt a governance model that will 
guarantee policy articulation, climate policy implementation and the coherence of national sectoral policies and strategies with the 
aim of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.
To this end, there is already a series of governance structures at a national, either at a political level, such as the Interministerial 
Commission on Air, Climate Change and the Circular Economy (CA)13, or at a technical level with sectoral articulation, in which the 
SPeM14  and the National System of Inventory of Emissions and Removal of Atmospheric Pollutants (SNIERPA) take on particular 
relevance.
CA2 provides guidance of a political nature and promotes the articulation and integration of climate change policies into sectoral 
policies and monitoring of the implementation of the relevant sectoral measures, programs and actions that are adopted.
In addition to monitoring compliance with Portugal’s commitments at national, Community and United Nations levels, this 
Commission should also ensure the promotion, supervision and monitoring of the implementation of policies and measures for 
effective implementation of the guidelines and compliance with the emission reduction targets established by the Integrated National 
Energy and Climate Plan (PNEC), and future periodic reviews, pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament 
and the Council of 11 December 2018.
In this way, monitoring progress towards the carbon neutral target will also fall to this Commission. 
The National System of Policies and Measures (SPeM) aims to involve and strengthen sectoral accountability in integrating the 
climate dimension into sectoral policies; ensure monitoring, follow-up and reporting of implementation of the policies and measures 
and their effects, and reporting of the projections of greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants; assess compliance with 
national obligations, including sectoral targets, under the EU package of climate and energy and of air policies for the 2020, 2025 
and 2030 time horizons, as set out respectively in PNAC 2020 - 2030 and the National Strategy for the Air 2020. 
Charting a course for carbon neutrality entails aligning sectoral policies with this long-term objective, and therefore the 
decarbonisation guidelines and vectors will need to be integrated into the various relevant sectoral policy plans and instruments, 
notably in the areas of energy, transport, trade, services, waste, agriculture and forests. Sectoral policies should thus focus on 
solutions that contribute to carbon neutrality and avoid options that limit the achievement of decarbonisation objectives in the future.

In this context, it will be essential to establish an impact assessment procedure to be incorporated into the legislative process, 
in order to make it possible to measure the contribution of these sectoral policy instruments and plans to carbon neutrality.  
Achieving this goal implies changes in our economy, our territorial model and our society, and therefore strengthening territorial 
cohesion in the transition process is crucial. Thus, this transition must be made in a planned way, involving the different sectors of 
our society and the different regions. 
Promoting the development of carbon neutrality roadmaps, at a regional and/or inter-municipal level, consistent with and linked 
to RNC2050, will enable a cohesive transition that is closer to the citizen, involving the active participation of regional actors and 
entities from different levels of territorial organisation.

ENGAGE  SOCIETY,  FOCUS  ON  EDUCATION,  INFORMATION  AND 
AWARENESS  AND  CONTRIBUTE  TO  INCREASING  INDIVIDUAL  AND 
COLLECTIVE ACTION
Understanding the problem of climate change and mobilising citizens, economic actors and policy makers to reduce GHG emissions 
and promoting society’s adaptation to a world with a changing climate are prerequisites for the success of any climate policy.
According to the Special Climate Change Eurobarometer of 2017, the Portuguese expressed the following opinions:
•	 83% consider climate change a ‘serious or very serious problem’; 
•	 they consider that national governments (50%), businesses and industry (48%), the EU (38%), local and regional 
authorities (36%) should take action to combat climate change;
•	 they believe that the impact on the economy and employment will be positive when combating climate change and 
promoting energy efficiency (87%) and reducing fossil fuel imports (79%);
•	 they consider it important for the government to set national targets for increasing the use of renewable energy (94%);
•	 they consider that the transition to clean energy should be supported financially and that fossil fuel subsidies should be 
reduced (82%) and that the government should support energy efficiency, particularly in the residential sector (93%)
•	 20% consider themselves personally responsible for taking action;
•	  60% say they have recently taken actions in the sense of combating climate change. However, when asked about 
concrete actions (such as adopting energy efficiency measures at home, acquiring efficient household appliances, 
behavioural change and mobility investments, etc.) the positive answers are not very significant.
These results suggest that the Portuguese, as consumers and citizens, acknowledge climate change as a problem but expect the 
government, businesses and local and regional authorities to act. It is therefore necessary to reinforce the notion of the importance 
of the contribution of individual action, through changes in behaviour and lifestyle.
In the business world, there is also a growing number of companies that have been integrating climate change as a critical factor in 
their business strategies and external communication, thus adopting a series of concrete actions that reduce their GHG emissions 
and/or call for changes in the behaviour of their consumers. 
The installations with bigger emissions at a national level have, since 2005, been covered by the CELE regime, whereby they are 
required to monitor, report and reduce their annual emissions. This coverage has internalised in these companies the environmental 
cost of greenhouse gas emissions, since such emissions have an associated cost. The existence of a robust carbon price is a key 
factor in driving investment in energy efficiency and low carbon technologies, resulting in reduced emissions, but also in reduced 
production costs and increased competitiveness.
 
89RNC2050
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
Aware of the paradigm shift, the various industrial sectors have been developing their own low carbon roadmaps, in which they 
identify the options for adapting their activity to the new reality; by anticipating the risk of disruption of their business model and 
strategic positioning focused on climate action as a competitive advantage.
There is also increasing adherence to systems that calculate their carbon footprint; auditing and reporting systems; eco-labelling 
systems; or environmental certification systems. Many companies are already using this information in their communication with 
consumers, their suppliers and other stakeholders, suggesting that many are aware of and interested in the social transformation 
associated with decarbonisation.
To generalise these trends, it is necessary to focus on raising awareness and training of corporate decision makers and employees 
to adopt sustainable production and service delivery methods that contribute to the fight against climate change, in particular by 
exploiting strategic themes such as the potential for GHG emissions reduction that their companies can achieve; the importance of 
integrating and safeguarding decarbonisation in their supply chains; the dissemination of good practices in terms of communication 
with consumers and enhancing transparency through tools such as the carbon footprint; the diffusion of new technologies and 
promotion of an environment for dialogue between research, innovation and development and the business world; the importance 
of eco-design, of energy efficiency; the circularity of production processes and materials, encouraging the use of by-products from 
other industries and the reduction or disposal of waste.
The financial system should be encouraged to differentiate positively and redirect investment towards sustainable, resilient and low 
carbon technologies and projects. Training of the staff of these institutions will be crucial for their decision trees to start to include 
criteria related to the contribution of proposed investments to decarbonisation and to assess the tolerance and resilience of these 
investments with regard to the consequences of climate change itself. It is also important to mobilise the demand side to increase 
its interest in more sustainable financial products and to publicise the importance of decarbonisation issues to businesses and 
consumers.
Portuguese non-governmental organisations active in the most diverse thematic areas, such as the environment, cooperation 
for development, human rights and local development, have also given increasing importance to the theme of climate change, 
contributing to citizens’ greater awareness and information and monitoring the actions of businesses, public bodies and policy 
decisions in this field.
Finally, and at the level of public authorities, there has also been significant progress. Examples of concrete measures for 
decarbonisation in the public sector include the Energy Efficiency in Public Administration Program ‘ECO.AP’, which has the aim 
of enabling the State to reduce energy consumption in services and agencies and to achieve a level of energy efficiency of 30% in 
Public Administration bodies and services; the Support Program for Electric Mobility in Public Administration, which aims to promote 
decarbonisation and improve the environmental performance of the State’s vehicle fleet; and the National Strategy for Green Public 
Procurement 2020 (ENCPE 2020), which aims to stimulate the adoption of a green public procurement policy.

LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
Employees and decision makers of the State and its central, sectoral, regional and local institutions will also need to be continually 
trained in order to integrate a climate change dimension into various sectoral policies and local planning. Also at a local level, there is 
an increasing number of municipalities involved in projects for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and/or planning adaptation 
to climate change, which can be seen, for example, in the Adap.PT Program15  and the national participation in the Covenant of 
Mayors16 . 
In the context of defining climate change policies, plans and programs, the involvement of the relevant actors and society at 
large is already an acquired practice that contributes to the adjustment essential to ensure their successful implementation. The 
preparation of RNC2050 was a participatory process with different formats and in different phases that allowed, from the beginning, 
the involvement of different points of view, the sharing of experiences and the co-creation of knowledge, which contributed to the 
development of a more informed Roadmap. 
The need for vast climate literacy at all levels of Portuguese society demonstrates the fundamental role of the education system, 
universities, vocational training and research laboratories. The decision makers in these areas should be mobilised and made 
aware of the importance of introducing these subjects into the curricula at various education levels, but also of the development of 
specific programs for training company employees for the new technologies and practices that will help the occupational retraining 
of workers in the sectors affected by decarbonisation. 
These subjects should also be included in the National Financial Education Plan. 
It therefore seems reasonable to assume that, as far as Portuguese society in general is concerned, there is a favourable starting 
point in Portugal for taking ambitious decisions on climate action. However, as RNC2050 shows, climate action will have to be 
sustained over decades and support for these policies cannot be taken for granted, so it is important that interest in and acceptance 
of these policies be continually promoted.
This task will always have a special focus on the citizen and, in this regard, it will be necessary to continue:
•	 Communicating what climate change is, how it manifests itself and how it evolves; 
•	 Educating about the climate impact of consumption choices and individual behaviours on emissions and ways to reduce 
these impacts; 
•	 Reinforcing the role of agents of change among the economic actors as consumers of goods and services; 
•	 Facilitating access to information on the impact of goods and services consumed; and 
•	 Creating a culture that demands that policy makers and economic and financial actors at all levels make decisions that 
lead to effective climate action.

FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
The path to carbon neutrality poses a significant series of challenges and opportunities for society. The transition to a carbon 
neutral economy requires timely long-term planning to take advantage of the opportunities associated with the transformation 
of the existing economy and to establish the basis of trust with the citizens and economic agents that this change is possible, 
advantageous and timely.
Carbon neutrality by 2050 is economically and technologically feasible and is based on a reduction in emissions of between 85% 
and 90% by 2050, compared with 2005, and offsetting the remaining emissions through a carbon sink provided by land use and 
forests. The trajectory to neutrality allows the anticipation of greenhouse gas emission reductions of between -45% and -55% by 
2030 and between -65% and -75% by 2040, compared to 2005.

LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
RNC2050 identifies key future trends and the social and economic transformations that will be needed, involving all sectors of 
the economy and society, and preparing a socially fair and cost-effective transition, enhancing the competitiveness of the national 
economy, promoting job creation and boosting co-benefits, particularly associated with air quality and human health.
In this regard, the following decarbonisation vectors and action lines for a carbon neutral society are identified:
a)  Decarbonising power generation by eliminating coal-based power generation by 2030 and proceeding with full 
decarbonisation of the power generation system by 2050, counting on renewable endogenous resources;
b)  Achieving energy transition by significantly increasing energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy, focusing on 
incorporating endogenous renewable energy sources into final energy consumption, promoting electrification and 
adjusting the role of natural gas in the national energy system;
c)  Progressively decentralising and democratising energy production and highlighting the role of the consumer as an active 
part of the energy system;
d)  Promoting decarbonisation in the residential sector, favouring urban regeneration and increased energy efficiency in 
buildings, fostering progressive electrification of the sector and the use of more efficient equipment, and combating 
energy poverty;
e)  Decarbonising mobility by favouring a public transport mobility system, by strengthening it and decarbonising fleets, 
supporting innovative and intelligent solutions for multimodal, active, shared and sustainable mobility, as well as electric 
mobility and other zero emission technologies, in addition to reducing the carbon intensity of sea and air transport, 
focusing on innovation, efficiency and cleaner, renewable fuels, as well as, by decarbonisation of short and long distance 
freight transport, promoting a logistic chain with a modal split that minimises the carbon and energy intensity of the 
transport system, reaffirming the role of maritime and inland waterway transport combined with rail freight transport.
f)  Promoting energy transition in industry, the incorporation of low carbon production processes and industrial symbioses, 
promoting innovation and competitiveness;
g)  Committing to sustainable agriculture, through a significant expansion of conservation agriculture and precision 
agriculture, substantially reducing emissions associated with livestock and fertiliser use and promoting innovation; 
h)  Encouraging carbon sequestration through active agricultural and forest management, promoting valorisation of the 
country;
i)  Changing the paradigm of resource use, moving away from the linear economic model and moving towards a circular 
and low carbon economic model;
j)   Preventing waste generation, increasing recycling rates and reducing waste disposal in landfills very significantly;
k)  Boosting the participation of cities and local governments in decarbonisation by encouraging an integrated approach to 
its different vectors, in particular mobility, buildings, services and waste management, and enhancing the role they have 
played in mitigating climate change;
93RNC2050
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
l)  Encouraging research, innovation and the production of knowledge in favour of neutrality in the various sectors of activity;
m)  Making taxation an instrument of the transition to neutrality, continuing to eliminate environmentally harmful subsidies, 
reinforcing application of the carbon tax and promoting greater taxation of resource use, reducing the tax burden on 
labour, recycling revenues for decarbonisation and a fair transition;
n)  Aligning financial flows for carbon neutrality, notably by fostering the development of a favourable environment for 
sustainable financing and greater involvement of the financial system; 
o)  Promoting the involvement of society in the transition, contributing to increase individual and collective action, the 
adoption of sustainable behaviours and a change in patterns of production and consumption in favour of sustainability, 
particularly through environmental education and awareness;
p)  Promoting skills development and (re)qualification directed towards the new opportunities for economic development;
q)  Encouraging the development of the new economy linked to energy transition and decarbonisation, supporting the 
development of new industrial clusters and the generation of new business opportunities;
r)  Promoting a fair and cohesive transition that enhances the country, creates wealth, promotes employment and contributes 
to raising the standards of quality of life in Portugal.
The practical realisation of the path to carbon neutrality and of these vectors should be initiated now within the PNEC framework, 
in order to achieve by 2030 the ambitious GHG reductions needed to align the national economy with a carbon neutral trajectory.
The decarbonisation vectors should be integrated into the development and review of relevant sectoral policies, in conjunction with 
existing instruments such as SPeM and SNIERPA, creating a culture of assessing the impact on national emissions of legislative 
proposals and all relevant sectoral instruments.
The achievement of a cohesive transition with the active participation of entities at different levels of territorial organisation, of 
regional agents and those closest to the citizen can be better ensured by a deeper understanding of RNC2050 at a sectoral, regional 
and/or inter-municipal level. 
Given the normal development of society and the evolution of technologies at the disposal of the country over a broad time horizon, 
it is important to ensure that RNC2050 is periodically updated with a view to incorporating, inter alia, monitoring of the evolution of 
climate change and the relevant international and European policies. 
Articulation and coordination of the different actors would benefit from a climate change law, which would be a fundamental 
instrument for combating climate change, in terms of mitigation and adaptation, enshrining their integration across society as a 
whole and establishing a governance structure for this purpose.
Ensuring compliance with the Paris Agreement implies continuing to support the mobilisation of efforts to increase global ambition 
and climate action, strengthening international cooperation on climate action, in particular with the Portuguese-speaking countries; 
continuing to defend Europe’s leading position in combating climate change; and continuing to participate in initiatives aimed at 
promoting and disseminating good climate action practices.

OF MINISTERSRNC2050
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
RESOLUTION OF THE 
COUNCIL OF MINISTERS
The Paris Agreement reached in 2015 set long-term objectives to contain the increase of the global average temperature to a 
maximum of 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, with the commitment of the international community to make all possible efforts to 
ensure that this increase would not exceed 1.5 °C, figures that science defines as maximums to ensure the continuation of life on 
the planet without overly serious changes. It also set objectives to increase the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate 
change and for mobilisation of financial flows consistent with low emission paths and resilient development, emphasising the need 
to strengthen international cooperation among states to achieve these objectives. 
The Paris Agreement thus represents a paradigm shift in the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change, with the explicit acknowledgement that only with everyone’s contribution can the challenge of climate change be 
overcome, and its main commitments are to achieve a global balance between anthropogenic emissions and removals - carbon 
neutrality - in the second half of the century.
Limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, in line with the more ambitious objectives of the Paris Agreement and the International Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on global warming of 1.5 °C, requires the unprecedented transformation of societies and the 
urgent and profound reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in all sectors of activity, as well as behavioural changes and the 
involvement of all the actors. It is also an unprecedented economic opportunity for an open economy that is still heavily dependent 
on fossil fuel imports like the Portuguese economy.
The Paris Agreement acknowledges that achieving carbon neutrality in the second half of this century will require strong leadership 
from developed countries and urges all Parties to present their long-term low-GHG development strategy by 2020. 
The European Union (EU) is preparing to adopt its long-term strategy, based on the European Commission Communication “A Clean 
Planet for All”, presented on 28 November 2018. The Commission’s proposal sets a long-term strategic vision for a prosperous, 
modern, competitive and climate-neutral economy. Under this strategy, projections indicate that the policies and objectives already 
established for the EU as a whole will allow GHG emissions to be reduced by around 45% by 2030 and around 60% by 2050. 
However, in order to contribute adequately to the Paris Agreement objectives, the EU should achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, 
corresponding to reductions of 80-95% in GHG emissions. Thus, it is essential to outline the best way to achieve this goal by 
aligning action in key areas, investing in realistic and cost-effective technological solutions, promoting active citizen participation 
and ensuring a fair transition.
Portugal has shown excellent results in climate policy matters over the past decades, having exceeded the targets set in the 
Kyoto Protocol and being on course to meet the goals set for 2020 of GHG emission reduction, energy efficiency and promotion 
of renewable energy sources. Since 2005, the national economy has tended to decouple economic growth from GHG emissions.
In 2016, the government made a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, outlining a clear vision on decarbonisation of 
the national economy and contributing to the most ambitious objectives under the Paris Agreement. 
97RNC2050
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
To support this commitment, the government decided to draw up a 2050 Carbon Neutrality Roadmap (RNC2050) with the aim of 
exploring the feasibility of trajectories that lead to carbon neutrality, identifying the main decarbonisation vectors and estimating 
the carbon reduction potential of various sectors of the national economy, such as energy and industry, mobility and transport, 
agriculture, forests and other land uses, and waste and wastewater. 
Decarbonisation of the economy is an ambitious goal that demands the broad involvement and participation of society as a whole, 
which is why RNC2050 motivated an unprecedented participatory process of involvement of the main sectors and mobilisation of 
Portuguese society.
RNC2050 shows that there are technologically feasible and economically viable cost-effective means for achieving carbon neutrality. 
Achieving carbon neutrality will have a positive impact on the economy and job creation, boosts investment and creates greater 
economic dynamism, while allowing significant savings that lead to equilibrium of the balance of payments. Additionally, it is 
associated with several positive impacts, such as improved air quality that inevitably translates into health gains.
Achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 implies, along with strengthening the carbon sequestration capacity of forests and other land 
uses, the near-total decarbonisation especially of the power generation system and of urban mobility, as well as profound changes 
in the way we use energy and resources, focusing on an economy that is based on renewable resources, that uses the resources 
efficiently and that relies on circular economy models, with special attention to logistic chains, with a modal split that minimises the 
carbon and energy intensity of short and long-distance freight transport, enhancing the country and promoting national cohesion.
The proposal is a process that will be truly transformational regarding how one faces some of the most crucial aspects of life in 
society, in particular as regards production and consumption patterns, the relationship with energy production and use, the way 
cities and housing, work and leisure spaces are thought of, or the way mobility needs are addressed. 
Achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 represents an opportunity for the country to consolidate an inclusive and people-centred model 
of sustainable development based on innovation, knowledge and competitiveness, while contributing to improving the health and 
well-being of people and of ecosystems. Achieving carbon neutrality is indeed probably the only way for Portugal to leverage its 
gains and position itself in a highly competitive international economic environment.
This vision will necessarily have to be translated into various sectoral policy plans and instruments in the areas of energy, transport, 
industry, trade, services, waste, agriculture and forests. Although greater investment in GHG reduction and energy transition is 
required over the next decade, this investment will have a high return and the co-benefits will be advantageous to society as a whole.
The Portuguese strategy for the transition to a carbon neutral economy is based on a combination of several options of policies and 
measures, as well as cost-effective technological options, seeking to find synergies between the various options. Decarbonisation is 
feasible with current technologies, and the development of new technologies will make it possible to achieve this goal more quickly 
and effectively than is currently estimated.
The development of new technologies and the refinement of existing low carbon technologies requires a significant impetus in 
innovation and research, which shall be achieved by adopting an ambitious and broad agenda covering all stages of the technology 
development cycle through to marketing.
For this, a large contribution will come from national and European support frameworks for research, innovation and development, 
which should be geared towards research into new technologies, new business models and the promotion of behavioural changes 
that will permit further increases in decarbonisation, creating innovative, efficient and “green” solutions with near zero emissions. 
Achieving the objective of carbon neutrality will entail allocating different financial flows to this objective, notably the next financing 
cycle under the Multiannual Financial Framework, national funds and directing foreign direct investment towards decarbonisation 
98RNC2050
LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR CARBON  
NEUTRALITY OF THE PORTUGUESE ECONOMY BY 2050
of the economy and of society and the energy transition, avoiding financing investments that are not in line with this objective and 
boosting the creation of new clusters in the national territory.
It is also necessary to examine the economic and social aspects of carbon neutrality, including new clusters and the affected 
sectors, and to develop policies to, respectively, create conditions for their development and anticipate appropriate territorial or 
social responses, at the level of education, training and professional retraining, to ensure a fair transition. 
Therefore:
Under the terms of paragraph g) of article 199 of the Constitution, the Council of Ministers resolves:
1.  To approve the Roadmap for Carbon Neutrality 2050 (RNC2050), which is in the annex to this resolution and which 
forms an integral part thereof, adopting the commitment to achieve carbon neutrality in Portugal by 2050, which 
translates into a neutral balance between greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon sequestration by land use 
and forests. 
2.  To establish the objective, for the purposes of the preceding paragraph, of reducing GHG emissions in Portugal by 
85% to 90% by 2050, compared to 2005, and to offset the remaining emissions through land use and forests, to
