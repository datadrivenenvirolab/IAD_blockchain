development low in greenhouse gas emissions construction and implementation of a state policy instead greenhouse and climate resilient in the Paris Agreement and with the tradition of honoring Climate Change commitments and the first Determined Contribution at the international. Here is a vision of the future in terms of National climate change information Second Contribution that Uruguay will present to the Framework Convention Addressing the causes of climate change requires a major United Nations Conference on Climate Change in 2022, which will propose multilateral coordination that countries commit to comply with emissions trajectories of greenhouse gases that reach their maximum as soon as possible and The elaboration of this Strategy was led by the Group of then record a decline. Although Uruguay contributes a very high Coordination of the National System for Response to Climate Change. low to total global greenhouse gas emissions efforts to promote low-carbon development different Ministries and other Institutions have always been present in the policy and instruments of change to promote climate action in Uruguay by ensuring a climate of the country and this is no exception. To contribute to the integral objective of the subject. Increase adaptability and resilience to limit the increase in the global average temperature of the Agreement against floods Paris CO2 neutrality by 2050 and emission stability scenarios is only possible by working in a coordinated manner and with a of CH4 and N2O food production. Through this Long-Term Climate Strategy Regarding the consequences of climate change It is important for Uruguay to increase the capacity to adapt to the external support needs that the country requires to do so. This and resilience of your society reduce vulnerability to adverse weather events that will be responsible for the problem of climate change more and more frequent. Adaptation is a national priority Uruguay being a country particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and this is reflected in the priority considerations in normative and institutional matters presented in this document. Adrian Pena Environment Minister Eastern Republic of Uruguay xRESUMEN EXECUTIVE01 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In order to meet the provisions established in the Agreement Taking into account that the basis of the national agreement on Paris (AP) climate change and adapt to its effects the framework of the National Climate Change Policy (PNCC) Nationally Determined Contribution (CDN1) before the Convention short terms United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in consideration of future generations and reinforcing the different November 2017. Both instruments were approved by Decree commitments assumed by the country 310/017 of the Executive Power. construction and implementation of a state policy instead climate. Uruguay's CRC1 includes the First Communication on Adaptation (ComAd1) under Article 7.10 of the AP objectives and goals to mitigate climate change by 2025 and those related to climate change main actions to achieve these goals. These activities in emissions and removals of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) are monitored and reported through a monitoring system report and verification (MRV) designed with the purpose of following up showing how the country contributes to the fulfillment of the objectives of the to the progress of implementation and thus contribute to the Paris Agreement Framework. Measures Enhanced Transparency (MRT) of the AP. walk the aspirational paths of the ECLP economical Within the framework of the Organization's Climate Action Summit, those policies will be defined in the successive CDNs. the United Nations 2019 prepare and present a "Long-Term Strategy for development with low greenhouse gas emissions the ability to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change and climate change and variability promoting climate resilience and low-carbon development and resilience and reducing that vulnerability and risk is a priority of the greenhouse food and based on the principle of common responsibilities but central sections of the document. differentiated and respective capabilities CO2 neutrality by 2050” Art. 4.19 of the Paris Agreement. by Uruguay in terms of adaptation and adding value through systematization of the different sectoral planning processes of adaptation that are currently under preparation (PNA- 12 Health and PNA-Energy) or implementation (PNA-Agro cities) they should deepen of decarbonization of those sectors that still continue to have a This document as a priority in national climate policy and action advance in achieving political parity between mitigation and adaptation feasible with current knowledge in the energy sector (92% of the that promotes the necessary mobilization of resources and external support CO2 emissions of the country according to INGEI 2017) for those adaptation actions. is recognized to continue developing PNAs on a sectoral or territorial basis that these processes contribute to the implementation of the PNCC MRV system and synergistically take advantage of the advances generated by battery-powered electric vehicles and the incorporation of green hydrogen in scientific knowledge of the country.

In this way It is important to mention the Energy Policy of Uruguay (2008-2030) agriculture and land use poses different scenarios of from which a structural transformation of the matrix was carried out carbon sequestration very fast energetic native forest area from alternative sources (biomass forest plantations for sawn wood and other industrial uses. being 76% of the installed power and more than 90% of the generation These scenarios contribute both in terms of carbon sequestration from renewable sources. This has made it possible to decouple emissions from as well as in terms of productivity. In the agricultural sector CO2 from economic growth mitigation efforts resulting from an expansion of afforestation mitigation included in the CDN1 of Uruguay. trade may involve trade-offs with other environmental aspects as natural field substitution at the time of defining concrete actions for the short and medium term 13in the different instances of public policy implementation. The elaboration process of the ECLP (Figure 01) was led by the It is worth mentioning that the increase in the area of forest plantations Coordination Group (GdC) of the National Response System to since the approval of the Forestry Law 15,939/87 the net result of CO2 emissions was negative during the period representatives of various Ministries and other national institutions 1990-2017 (CO2 sequestration) increased removals of wood emissions. SNRCC formed in May 2020 carry out this process (GoT ECLP). In relation to methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) greenhouse strongly linked to food production agricultural sector (94% of total CH4 emissions and 97% of total of N2O emissions in the country according to INGEI 2017) proposes scenarios of FIRST CDN emissions stability in the transition to 2050 (2020 - 2025) these scenarios a growing ambition in relation to the objectives included in the CDN1 of Uruguay. through these scenes aims to contribute to the objective of "not putting at risk the production of food” consigned in the Paris Agreement GHG emissions in one of the main sectors of the economy of the country 2017 2016 -2017 On the other hand urban solid waste (6% of total CH4 emissions in the country according to INGEI 2017) will be considerably reduced as a result of the implementation of the National Waste Management Plan by the Ministry of Environment of Uruguay SECOND CDN STRATEGY circular economy. For this sector, ambitious scenarios are proposed CLIMÁTICA AC. PARIS LONG TERM (2025 - 2030) minimization of landfilling of solid waste on the path to (2020 - 2050) the 2050.

Hypotheses and future scenarios aspirational scenarios. Based on the aspirational scenarios raised by each of the sectors and for the different GHGs The scenarios and trajectories of GHG emissions and removals were with the diagnostic information generated for the ECLP constructed from the analysis of the historical series of INGEI (sectors categories and relevant variables) and the agreed projections of generations that emerge from said trajectories. Uruguay understands that demographic and GDP evolution. In this sense include GHG emissions from categories that represent between the 95- no one behind 97% of the country's total emissions. These scenarios include GHG define concrete actions in the short and medium term to transit these CO2 sectoral ministries associated with the emissions and removals of said GEI: Office of Programming and Agricultural Policy of the MGAP Ministry of Energy of the MIEM and National Directorate of Climate Change and and risk reduction was different MA Planning Division. existing sectoral adaptation planning processes in the country are already looking to the future and planning for the medium and long term. Having As a general slogan for the work, it was defined that they would be elaborated taking into account that least two scenarios for each of the sectors and for each of the moment GHG: i) a trend scenario whose trajectory should ensure the identification of areas to be strengthened compliance with the unconditional objectives included in the CRC1 for future adaptation and resilience. For it each gas to the year 2025 (target year of the CDN1); ii) at least one scenario comprehensive literature review and interviews were held with aspirational that considers emission reduction trajectories and key actors directly linked to said processes. With the ambitious increase in carbon sequestration consider the aspirational goal of CO2 neutrality by 2050 announced efforts made by the country in this area by the government of Uruguay in 2019 at the Climate Summit. to contribute to the implementation of the Global Adaptation Goal and to World Balance through the different actions in adaptation that Following those guidelines aspirational trajectories of GHG emissions / removals are based on the institutional technical knowledge and experiences of other 3.2.

These factors make it a highly vulnerable country to change and national priority and in a long-term planning process; Secondly Uruguay needs to advance in sizing and explaining the efforts and associates will increase their intensity and frequency. A Level Up possible and necessary actions to strengthen adaptation reduce the risk of climate change; and third seeks to contribute to the strengthening of a global governance that registers an increase of almost 35% in the average annual rainfall (for a a political parity and mobilization of financial resources between distant horizon) adaptation and mitigation of climate change direct efforts that contribute to the design of the Global Adaptation Goal and the national territory and increases in the average annual temperature between 1.5 to the World Balance provided for in the Paris Agreement. Added to the ratios and 3°C indicated the Paris Agreement resilience in this planning exercise. Considering the above and knowing the complexity involved in planning and make progress on adaptation Increase adaptation capacity and resilience to climate change and reduce the risks involved it is justified by the fact that Uruguay has an open economy planning in the field of climate action heavily based on agro-industrial production food exports 79% of the total (PNA-Agro) tourism that in recent years has reached great dynamism. Your National Climate Change Population (PNCC) and main infrastructures are in risk areas; 70% of the total Adaptation (PNAs) the population is found in the coastal departments (Colonia Joseph coastal areas have a tourist use (PNA-Coasts) concentrated in urban areas institutions larger economic assets. Article 2 is also concentrated in the cities: “Increase the capacity to adapt to the adverse effects 27of climate change and promote resilience to climate and a development reason is that the ECLP proposes actions that seek to strengthen the with low greenhouse gas emissions does not compromise food production.” In fact The document seeks to reflect said contribution and connect those efforts with the impacts derived from medium and long-term climate projections. Global Adaptation Goal (MGA) information that facilitates the realization of the World Balance on adaptation. territories. Finally refers to the possibility of increasing the capacity for adaptation and resilience. in which the emissions scenarios and projections were built It does this by referring to article 2 in the invitation (paragraph 19 of the article and GHG removals presented in the section below. The 4): “All Parties should strive to develop and communicate strategies exercise on emissions and removals was driven by in the long term for a development with low greenhouse gas emissions the detection of desirable and technologically feasible scenarios (in greenhouse common but differentiated responsibilities and their respective capabilities in light of different national circumstances. By indicating "having is determined present article 2” in Article 4.19 it is made explicit temperature climate resilience. 4.1. Methodological considerations 4.2. Relevant milestones in terms of adaptation risk at national and international level The preparation of this section is based on two methodological premises. By a side to climate change in a sectoral and territorial manner. The result of it matter of adaptation is that there are three National Adaptation Plans (PNA) for the agricultural sector infrastructures and in Health. Considering this definition with an "aggregate" perspective and focused on the normative and institutional not entering into sectoral or territorial specificities in which medium and long-term actions are possible in institutional matters and current and potential NAPs focus. regulations that allow to increase the capacity of adaptation and resilience of Uruguay in the face of climate change and reduce the risk. Finally The second methodological premise refers to the fact that Uruguay is presenting the relevance of working on adaptation in Uruguay seeking highly affected by climate change and variability and for this contribute to the Global Adaptation Goal. 28+ ECLP (2020_2050) + DAY COSTAS + DAY cities + PNRCC  + PCRM + NAP.E Plan  Plan  + NAP Agro + NAP Salud National Climate + National Plan Response the Region + MVDEO GIRED the Resilient Metropolitan CC 2009 2010 2012 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2025 + SNRCC + Ministry of Decree 238/09 + SINAE + DCC/MVOTMA + PNCC + NDC Ambiente Law 18,621 3 Art 479 Law Decree 310/17 Law 19,889 N DE HYOGO N DE CANCÚN O PARIS / ODS.1 19.355 +++ DPDRLAeNeIeryNgtcG .lSrA a4IeIRmCN9tEo7CeA D n0LEt6Pa6.c 2 / i2ó00n2 200 CIÓ CIÓ RD Decree 065/2020 C C E A A U RCO OF RCO OF DAI / AC A A N M M E S 2005 2010 2015 Figure 04: Relevant milestones in adaptation 294.3.
