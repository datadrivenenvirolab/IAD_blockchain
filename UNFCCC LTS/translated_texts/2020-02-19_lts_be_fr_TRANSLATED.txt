The central objective of this agreement is to limit the increase in global temperature well below 2°C maximum the 1 the agreement presented a Nationally Determined Contribution by 2025/2030. In outraged long-term development with low greenhouse gas emissions. In preparation for the EU's long-term strategy to be presented to the UNFCCC in 2020 European Commission published in November 2018 its long-term strategic vision entitled “A clean planet for all” modern goal 1 detailed and in-depth analysis climate can be achieved by 2050. At the European Council of 12 and 13 December 2019 European heads of government endorsed the goal of a climate-neutral Europe by 2050 as soon as possible in 2020 15 of the Governance Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2018/1999) also requires that each Member State member draws up and submits a long-term strategy to the European Commission before the 1st January 2020. Through this long-term strategy Paris and the European regulation on governance businesses. 2. Belgian context and approach Belgium is a federal state in which decision-making power is shared between a state federal French and German-speaking). In terms of climate policy important in areas such as the rational use of energy renewable energy sources urban and rural planning responsible for much of the fiscal policy.

The federal level wishes to cooperate with the regional entities and support them in their transition towards a climate-neutral society. To this end of vision containing a number of strategic projects and concrete levers that can be deployed to support the transition from the federal level. The policy summary (item 4) provides an overview of the main common elements of the policies regional skills. 3. Public consultations Given the above approach that each region has developed its own long term strategy public consultations. Several stakeholder and public consultations on climate and energy policy have already been organized in recent years interfederal energy pact and the Belgian national energy-climate plan) and at regional level (in framework of regional policy strategies and plans). What's more technical studies and explorations on long-term greenhouse gas reduction scenarios have been carried out (both at Belgian and regional level). For reasons of efficiency chose to base its strategy on study work and stakeholder input existing also indicated in its strategy that this is not to be considered as an end point. Each region agrees to develop routes for the coming months/years to continue the discussion on regional strategies with the public substantiate them and elaborate them in more detail if necessary. The federal level also wishes to cooperate and support the different levels of power elements identified. The attached regional strategies contain more detailed information on how existing study work and stakeholder contributions have been incorporated and on the planned future routes: (cid:120) Walloon Region: see chapters 1.4 and 1.5 (cid:120) Flemish Region: see the introduction (cid:120) Brussels-Capital Region: see chapter 3.3 4. Summary of Policies 4.1 General level of ambition The regions' long-term strategies foresee the following aggregate emission reductions by 2050 : 2 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:6) (cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:3) (cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:14)(cid:12)(cid:15)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:13) (cid:9)(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:7)(cid:2)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:7)(cid:24)(cid:7)(cid:7) (cid:4)(cid:25) (cid:8)(cid:26)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:120) The Walloon long-term strategy aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 by one reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 95% compared to 1990 measures relating to carbon capture and use and negative emissions (see also chapters 2 and 2.1 of the Walloon strategy); (cid:120) The Flemish long-term strategy aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from sectors that are not covered by the ETS (the so-called non-ETS sectors) by 85% by 2050 by compared to 2005 concerns sectors covered by the ETS by the EU for these sectors with a decreasing emission quota (see also chapter 2.1 of the Flemish strategy); (cid:120) The long-term strategy of Brussels-Capital sets the objective of getting closer to the European objective of carbon neutrality by 2050 (see also chapter 4.1 of the strategy of Brussels-Capital). The federal level does not have its own reduction target Belgian greenhouse gas emissions are covered by regional emissions. In addition to the ambitions to reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions regions are also striving - to varying degrees - to limit indirect emissions and their carbon footprint. The attached regional strategies provide more detailed information (see for example point 4.2 of the Walloon strategy of the strategy of the Brussels-Capital Region). 4.2 Expected emission levels by sector In accordance with the requirements of the Governance Regulation information on expected emission levels by sector in 2050. The table below presents these expected emission levels at the Belgian level. However, it is important to take into account in this regard the following observations: (cid:120) The nature of expected emission levels by sector differs by region and sometimes even across sectors within the same region. For example contains ‘indicative expected contributions’ by sector Wallonia refers to the results of the "Wallonia Low Carbon" study sectors have been taken into account in an 80% reduction scenario. The table below below therefore does not in any way contain strict sectoral objectives at Belgian level rather serves to illustrate the expected emission levels by sector at the Belgian level on the basis of the three regional strategies. The nature and source (including underlying assumptions) underlying) regional figures are specified in the attached regional strategies; (cid:120) The figures for 2030 in the table below are based on the WAM scenarios regional as elaborated in the Belgian PNEC 2; (cid:120) The Flemish strategy does not contain a quantified estimation of emission levels expected in 2050 for Flemish industry covered by the ETS system.

The table above shows that regional strategies from 85% to 87% by 2050 compared to 2005. 4.3 Main axes by sector Each regional strategy addresses the key changes and breakthroughs4 needed in each sector to achieve the planned emission reductions. Each region was able to integrate its own accents and priorities. However, we note the recurrence of a certain number of elements 3 = 52 2 2 of the electricity sector excluding ETS which is not distinguished in table 1 4 In the Walloon strategy uses the term 'bouwstenen' ‘strategic development’ of each sector. 4 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:6) (cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:3) (cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:14)(cid:12)(cid:15)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:13) (cid:9)(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:7)(cid:2)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:7)(cid:24)(cid:7)(cid:7) (cid:4)(cid:25) (cid:28)(cid:26)(cid:4)(cid:8)centrals. These common elements are briefly summarized below5. Next which the federal level could support the regions in their transition are briefly described. Electricity sector Each region recognizes that electricity production must be totally neutral change by 20506. This is why renewable region. Strategies differ somewhat on the role of biomass in the electricity mix: in Walloon and Flemish strategies still a role to play (given the cascade principle) the use of biofuels is considered inappropriate in an urban context considering the impact on air quality. Each region also foresees that electrification - combined with a supply of climate-neutral electricity - will contribute significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gases greenhouse in other sectors buildings (eg heat pumps) and industry. At the same time renewable energy (and energy production in general) is insufficient to fully cover the expected future demand. Each region therefore assigns a role in its long-term strategy important to the import of climate-neutral electricity (and other energy sources). The strategies of the Flemish and Walloon Regions also indicate the need for a reform of the current energy system flexible batteries) and long periods (e.g. Power-to-X). The federal level can support energy on demand management in the European electricity network and the possible construction of the infrastructures necessary to importing carbon neutral energy sources. With these levers ensure a reliable energy supply notably facilitate electrification in other sectors. Besides consultation with the regions - A long-term vision in terms of electricity supply; - Transport infrastructure for green hydrogen and synthetic fuels; - A long-term framework for the integration of intermittent sources by all actors; - Support for an active role for citizens. 5 For a complete overview 6 The Walloon and Brussels strategies refer to an energy mix entirely based on sources of renewable energy fossil emissions in the electricity mix by 2050. 5 (cid: 1) (cid: 2) (cid: 2) (cid: 3) (cid: 4) (cid: 5) (cid: 6) (cid: 7) (cid: 8) (cid: 6) (cid: 8) (cid: 7) (cid: 8) (cid: 7) (cid: 3) (cid: 9) (cid: 10) (cid: 11) (cid: 12) (cid: 3) (cid: 13) (cid: 14) (cid: 14) (cid: 12) (cid: 15) (cid: 12) (cid: 3) (cid: 16) (cid: 17) (cid: 13) (cid: 9) (cid: 3) (cid: 18) (cid: 19) (cid: 3) (cid: 4) (cid: 4) (cid: 6) (cid: 7) (cid: 8) (cid: 6) (cid: 8) (cid: 7) (cid: 8) (cid: 7) (cid: 3) (cid: 20) (cid: 8) (cid: 7) (cid: 8) (cid: 7) (cid: 2) (cid: 21) (cid: 7) (cid: 22) (cid: 23) (cid: 7) (cid: 24) (cid: 7) (cid: 7) (cid: 4) (cid: 25) (cid: 29) (cid: 26) (cid: 4) (cid: 8) Industrie The Walloon and Flemish7 strategies both recognize that industry remains a source significant amount of greenhouse gases today industry towards climate-friendly production systems). Flanders emphasizes the prevention of carbon leakage through effective measures so that emissions are actually reduced In this context scale and new innovative industrial models. Both strategies identify the levers following common areas: In the industrial sectors themselves energy efficiency. An important point of attention in this respect is the maximum valuation of the waste heat renewable and climate-neutral energy carriers and raw materials will further reduce emissions. To this end direct as well as other climate-neutral energy carriers other synthetic fuels. Biofuels will also have a role to play for industrial processes for which electrification or other energy carriers without carbon are not an option. However biomass as a raw material is preferable to its combustion as a fuel. At last emissions In a broader context mentions the importance of a transition to a circular economy are designed and reducing the consumption of raw materials should also contribute significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gases in the industrial sector than in other sectors (see also point 4.5 below). The federal level can contribute standardization of products and taxation focusing on longer life disassembly and less material intensity of the products. Transport The three regions aim to reduce emissions from the transport sector to zero by 2050 the transport of people than of goods8. To this end emphasis on the following common elements: 7 The Brussels long-term strategy does not devote a specific chapter to the industry sector due to its very limited share in the greenhouse gas emissions of Brussels-Capital. She devotes however a chapter on the reduction of fluorinated gases and refers in general terms to the “initiatives developing carbon-free production models 8 The Walloon strategy speaks of complete decarbonization transport and the Brussels strategy also considers that it is possible to largely decarbonise 6 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:6) (cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:3) (cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:14)(cid:12)(cid:15)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:13) (cid:9)(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:7)(cid:2)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:7)(cid:24)(cid:7)(cid:7) (cid:4)(cid:25) (cid:23)(cid:26)(cid:4)(cid:8) Each strategy focuses primarily on managing/rationalizing the demand for transport circular economy with shorter local value chains haulage. Besides key to achieving the climate ambitions set air quality terms passenger transport modal split bike) shared modes of transport (public transport and shared vehicles). To this end emphasize a quality offer of alternative modes promotion of combined mobility9. The concept of Mobility-as-a-Service is also recognized as an important lever to achieve the objective of combined mobility and to increase the rate vehicle occupancy (which results in a reduction in the number of kilometers traveled per vehicle). Regarding the transport of goods both aim to shift from road to rail and waterways. At last transition to zero-emission vehicles and energy carriers. About the passenger transport emission-free vehicles (battery or hydrogen-powered)10. For the transport of goods also recognize that the challenge is greater and will require new developments technologies. Besides electrification and hydrogen biofuels and synthetic fuels for heavy goods transport. The strategy of Brussels-Capital mentions the plans aiming to ban the traffic of diesel cars from 2030 from 2035 At last greenhouse gases from international aviation and shipping climate-friendly alternative fuels. The federal level will ensure sufficient interconnections with neighboring countries to allow an increase in the share of the rail in the transport of people and goods. Also it can support expertise in taxation and product standardization alternative transport and towards zero-emission vehicles. transport by 2050 and that the electricity used for transport is of renewable origin. 9 This means that a single journey is made with several modes of transport most suitable mode of transport for each part of the trip and can easily switch between modes. 10 The Walloon strategy indicates that the long-term priority is electrification The energy efficiency of electric vehicles is 2 to 3 times greater than that of thermal propulsion vehicles. The Flemish strategy indicates that batteries and hydrogen fuel cells are the only alternative existing zero-emission. 11 The Walloon strategy speaks of complete decarbonisation. The Flemish strategy speaks of a complete passage zero-emission vehicles. 7 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:6) (cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:3) (cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:14)(cid:12)(cid:15)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:13) (cid:9)(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:7)(cid:2)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:7)(cid:24)(cid:7)(cid:7) (cid:4)(cid:25) (cid:22)(cid:26)(cid:4)(cid:8) Buildings Each of the strategies gives a central place to the significant improvement of the efficiency energy efficiency of the building stock by 2050. To this end ambitious plans for new constructions and the accelerated and significant improvement of the energy performance of the existing building stock by 2050 (mainly through renovations thorough were included in accordance with the regional renovation strategies: (cid:120) Walloon strategy: average objective equivalent to primary energy consumption12 (cid:1095)85 kWh/m2/year for the residential building stock; (cid:120) Flemish strategy: average target equivalent to primary energy consumption13 (cid:1095)100 kWh/m2/year for the residential building stock building ; (cid:120) Brussels strategy: average objective equivalent to primary energy consumption14 (cid:1095)(cid:1005)(cid:1004)(cid:1004) kWh/m2/year for the entire building stock; (cid:120) Regarding the tertiary sector in energy or carbon by 2050 in terms of heating cooling and lighting.

La stratégie wallonne Behavioral change can play an important role in moving towards a more rational energy consumption. Thanks to these tax skills and deepening of the building stock and a greening of the energy mix. The federal level will ensure also that its own building stock is completely energy-neutral and climate by 2040. Waste Although the waste sector is not the subject of a separate chapter of the regional strategies theme is addressed in the parts dealing with other sectors (mainly under the heading ‘industry’ in the Walloon and Flemish strategies in the Brussels strategy). In their strategies circular economy as part of efforts to achieve its climate ambitions (alongside other goals such as result reduction will allow the almost total elimination of greenhouse gas emissions. Agriculture Although the Walloon and Flemish strategies focus on the specific characteristics of their respective agricultural sectors common (1) the levers within the agricultural system: the two strategies target adaptations and improvements within the farming system leading to reduced greenhouse gas emissions greenhouse: the focus is on smart farming and precision farming (for minimize raw material and energy input and maximize yield) aimed at increasing nitrogen efficiency (e.g. better manure management) techniques to reduce enteric emissions from livestock (e.g. genetic selection and rations suitable food). Both strategies also focus heavily on energy efficiency and greening the energy mix to significantly reduce emissions energy15 from the agricultural sector. 2) the link with LULUCF and biomass: in addition the agricultural sector can make an important contribution as a producer of biomass and biofuels (not only through the direct production of energy crops valuing secondary flows such as the fermentation of animal manure to extract the biomethane) and by carbon sequestration in agricultural land (see also section separate below). 15 This aspect is especially relevant for the Flemish strategy considerable in the Flemish greenhouse horticulture sector. In the Walloon agricultural sector energy consumption is already relatively low due to the limited presence of greenhouse horticulture. 9 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:6) (cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:3) (cid:13)(cid:14)(cid:14)(cid:12)(cid:15)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:17)(cid:13) (cid:9)(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:8)(cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:7)(cid:2)(cid:21)(cid:7)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:7)(cid:24)(cid:7)(cid:7) (cid:4)(cid:25) (cid:5)(cid:26)(cid:4)(cid:8)3) les leviers au sein du système alimentaire: enfin within the wider food system in order to mobilize the reduction potential. In this context maximum food residues and other side streams consumption towards more local and seasonal products and a healthier diet. The strategy of Brussels-Capital only reserves a limited place for the agricultural sector because of its very low share of greenhouse gas emissions in this region. In this domain more climate change mitigation (e.g. less food transport) offers many advantages (greening UTCATF16 At last soils and biomass. These include the extension of green spaces (forests parks agriculture promoting carbon sequestration in agricultural land. In this regard information is available in the regional strategies in the annexes chapter 3.6.1. of the strategy of the Flemish Region and chapters 2.1.1. and 3.5. of the strategy of Wallonia. Each strategy also addresses potential synergies with adapting to change climatic. For example drought or flood expected heat waves (particularly in urban areas) and adequate management of our forests can increase their resilience to climate change. 4.4Main thrusts of the adaptation policy Belgium is already suffering the consequences of climate change with the increase in average global temperature. The country must therefore organize itself to adapt to the expected or already real consequences and to manage the associated risks.

Through Strategies consultations d'experts climate change. 4.5 Cross-cutting points of attention Each entity also addresses a number of relevant transversal points of attention for the long-term strategy. This chapter presents common points of attention for a successful transition. A socially just transition The transition to be made by Belgium constitutes a challenge for society as a whole. Both the regions and the federal level stress the importance of a socially just transition in which no one is left behind. To this end in favor of broad citizen participation appropriate to new occupations and support for low-income groups and other vulnerable target groups most exposed to the impact of this transition. Efforts will be particularly deployed to combat energy poverty. A secure and sufficient supply of sustainable and affordable energy The Flemish and Walloon strategies both recognize the need for a supply safe and sufficient sustainable and affordable energy for Belgian citizens and businesses by 2050. The success of this challenge is crucial so that the transition can be done in a social way safeguarding the competitiveness of our companies. To this end also covered in section 4.3 sectors) flexible and decentralized energy (including energy storage and demand side management). The three regions also recognize that Belgium will continue to be dependent on energy imports (climate neutral). For the realization of regional strategies therefore counts on a secure and sufficient supply of sustainable and affordable energy in coming from abroad. 11 (cid: 1) (cid: 2) (cid: 2) (cid: 3) (cid: 4) (cid: 5) (cid: 6) (cid: 7) (cid: 8) (cid: 6) (cid: 8) (cid: 7) (cid: 8) (cid: 7) (cid: 3) (cid: 9) (cid: 10) (cid: 11) (cid: 12) (cid: 3) (cid: 13) (cid: 14) (cid: 14) (cid: 12) (cid: 15) (cid: 12) (cid: 3) (cid: 16) (cid: 17) (cid: 13) (cid: 9) (cid: 3) (cid: 18) (cid: 19) (cid: 3) (cid: 4) (cid: 4) (cid: 6) (cid: 7) (cid: 8) (cid: 6) (cid: 8) (cid: 7) (cid: 8) (cid: 7) (cid: 3) (cid: 20) (cid: 8) (cid: 7) (cid: 8) (cid: 7) (cid: 2) (cid: 21) (cid: 7) (cid: 22) (cid: 23) (cid: 7) (cid: 24) (cid: 7) (cid: 7) (cid: 4) (cid: 25) (cid: 4) (cid: 4) (cid: 26) (cid: 4) (cid: 8) Innovation et R&D Each of the strategies stresses the importance of innovation and R&D. Each entity recognizes the need for technological breakthroughs and innovations to achieve significant reductions emissions in hard-to-decarbonise sectors outraged sharing systems support for the development of innovations to move towards a more circular economy. Investments and financing The regional strategies pay particular attention to the needs in terms of funding. In effect concerned and can therefore only be achieved with sufficient funding. The strategies Brussels and Flanders already include an initial estimate of financing needs expected (based on existing studies) to identify these needs more precisely. To meet funding needs specific. The attached regional strategies provide more information on this: (cid:120) Walloon Region: chapter 5. (cid:120) Flemish Region: chapter 5.4. (cid:120) Brussels-Capital Region: chapter 7.3 Circular economy At last climate ambitions lead to a reduction in the demand for primary raw materials and basic products in the profit from high-value end products and new services (e.g. repair services) reduction in transport needs recovery of secondary flows (both energy and raw materials) and elimination almost total phase-out of emissions in the waste sector. Regional strategies therefore attaches great importance to the application of the principles of the circular economy in the different sectors. In addition to reducing direct emissions additional benefits Belgium imports of (scarce) materials. 12 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:6)

different processes and applications in all sectors of society. Too single-handedly solve the problem: sustained efforts from all sectors are necessary to achieve the targeted reductions. In many cases emissions within existing systems has its limits and we will focus on systemic changes. Success cannot be at the rendezvous decades look in the same direction. This is why the Flemish Government has undertaken to put put in place an ambitious and realistic climate strategy. We can in this way Flanders mobilize more resources innovative. On the other hand potential at a later stage. A long-term strategy must be both flexible and make bold choices. The future is unpredictable. Flanders' long-term strategy will therefore be regularly evaluated in order to be able to adapt to future developments politico-social. On another side systemic changes. So we no longer have time to wait for some breakthroughs technological essential in a climate-neutral world (the so-called no-regrets options). The citizens energetic the stated ambitions. The role of the authority is to create a clear framework within which the actors can initiate the transition. This framework will provide the right incentives and ensure cost-effectiveness climate-friendly investments and efforts. Investments incompatible with a climate-neutral world will be discouraged in due course. By this strategy clear ambition for 2050 and examines necessary to achieve this objective. It also examines the prerequisites important to complete to make the transition achievable and affordable. A STRATEGY FOR DIRECT AND INDIRECT EMISSIONS The atmosphere knows no national borders and when it comes to the greenhouse effect no matter where the emissions are precisely emitted. This situation has several consequences: ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// page 4 of 47 Flemish climate strategy for 2050 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:14) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:17) (cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21) (cid:24)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:25)(cid:24)(cid:21) (cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:2)(cid:26)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:29)(cid:21) (cid:21)(cid:18)(cid:30) (cid:22)(cid:31)(cid:22)(cid:27)• d'une part Flemish territorial issues significantly our carbon footprint (i.e. emissions beyond our borders that are linked to Flemish consumption)1. About two-thirds of the carbon footprint of the Flemish consumption are in fact issued outside our borders2. Although this long-term strategy focuses primarily on direct Flemish issues (particularly because it is the interpretation of European obligations and the approach prescribed at European level) the measures and components that reduce the carbon footprint of Flanders; •  on the other hand reduction of emissions from Flanders by the mere fact of the relocation of certain activities to other regions. In effect against climate change (on the contrary additional and/or less stringent environmental standards in other regions on the Flemish economy; • as one of the most prosperous regions in the world and as a home port strong research institutions and innovative companies the assets to position ourselves as a leader in the development of new technologies and new production processes with no impact on the weather where we can maintain business competitiveness. We can thus as an innovative leader climate change territorial. A STRATEGY BASED ON EXISTING INITIATIVES AND STAKEHOLDER CONTRIBUTIONS For this long-term strategy strategy fits into the European context. In 2011 Roadmap towards a competitive low-carbon economy by 2050 (COM (2011) 112) 2050 Commission has published an updated proposal for a long-term strategy entitled ‘One Planet clean for all’ (COM (2018) 773). This proposal – and above all the in-depth analysis that accompanies it – explores avenues through which the EU can achieve net zero emissions by 2050. These analytical explorations at the European level already offer some knowledge on which the Flemish climate strategy could be based. Secondly which identify the options by which we can drastically reduce our emissions of 1 For a correct calculation of our carbon footprint 2 VITO (2017) ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// page 5 of 47 Flemish climate strategy for 2050 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:14) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:17) (cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21) (cid:24)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:25)(cid:24)(cid:21) (cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:2)(cid:26)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:29)(cid:21) (cid:21)(cid:18)(cid:30) (cid:33)(cid:31)(cid:22)(cid:27)gaz à effet de serre.

This existing study work also offers a number of knowledge that has contributed to the development of this Flemish climate strategy; Thirdly Flemish such as the global vision note "Vision 2050 Flanders " stakeholders have also endorsed – and the 2017 Interfederal Energy Pact that the Flemish government hosted in 2018. More recently was approved on December 9, 2019 by the Flemish Government. quote government at the end of September 2019 long-term Flemish climate ambitions (e.g. a reduction of at least 80% at horizon 2050 with the ambition to move towards total climate neutrality). These outlines have been adopted as the starting point for this long-term strategy. We can Flemish climate policy and its round tables resulted from it the Spatial Policy Plan for Flanders as a preamble and in reaction to the PFEC studies exploring the possibilities of further reductions in Belgium (and also in Flanders). The above clearly demonstrates the existence of a whole panoply of studies and contributions of stakeholders on which this long-term strategy could be based. We propose below is an overview of the main elements resulting from these studies and contributions from parties stakeholders that have been taken over for this Flemish long-term strategy: • based on the ambitions drawn from the government agreement of October 2019 long-term targets an 85%4 reduction by 2050 total climate neutrality. As explained later non-Flemish ETS sectors compared to 2005; our ETS sectors must comply to the European emission ceiling. • The EU Governance Regulation requires Member States to resume in their long-term strategy the greenhouse gas emissions/reductions expected by sector by 2050. In addition to the clarity that this brings to the different sectors on the effort expected of them enough to keep the end goal achievable. In its opinion “Veel vuur voor energy and climate visions » however cautions against an overly dirigiste approach with strict sectoral targets and states that the sectoral objectives should only give an indication of the efforts 3 http://stroomversnelling.vlaanderen/ 4 The government agreement speaks of “80% at least”.

These two elements were taken into account when drafting this strategy to long term. Sectoral explorations have not only taken into account emissions territorial the material and carbon footprint of Flanders. Furthermore in global production chains (eg. given to the risk of offshoring of emissions (carbon leakage) and the importance of combine competitiveness and climate policy; • multiple reviews series of key measures to achieve a climate-friendly society effective land use planning technological of renewable energy production.

Although the recommended routes may differ depending on the source several elements reappear on a recurring basis and can therefore be considered as essential building blocks for achieving our ambitions in horizon 2050. They have been included in the sectoral explorations of chapter 3 of the this strategy and in Chapter 4 with regard to adapting to change climatic.

Besides that the expected/targeted emission reductions by sector by 2050 be established6. On the other hand recovery of residual heat from industrial installations for heating makes it possible to achieve reductions in the construction sector and shorter chains in the sectors agricultural and industrial can lead to a decrease in the demand for mobility and therefore reductions in the transport sector. Similarly can have an impact (both positive and negative) on emissions in other sectors while collaborations between sectors or transversal actions create precisely great opportunities for the climate transition. At last new reduction potential in certain sectors while developments disappointing may hinder the realization of the contribution sought. For this reason below gives an indicative breakdown based on the knowledge available at the time current rather than strict objectives and serves mainly to clarify the scope of the issue and its implications. The indicative contribution for industry as set out in the table below does not concern that the part not covered by the European Union Emissions Trading System (SEQE-UE) conversion to climate-friendly production systems is not set at the level of Flanders since an absolute emission ceiling has already been set via the EU ETS. Thanks to the already planned annual reinforcement of this ceiling (electricity + ETS industry) must reduce 85% compared to 2005. In line with the recently adopted EU target to be climate neutral by 2050 1 – also largely covered by the EU ETS – zero emissions by 2050. 6 Cf. article 15 ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// page 13 of 47 Flemish climate strategy for 2050 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:14) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:17) (cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21) (cid:24)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:25)(cid:24)(cid:21) (cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:2)(cid:26)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:29)(cid:21) (cid:21)(cid:18)(cid:30) (cid:18)(cid:32)(cid:31)(cid:22)(cid:27)Pour tous les secteurs hors SEQE policies/projections for 2030 as they appear in the Flemish Energy- Weather Table 1.

In other sectors expect a shift from fossil fuels to green electricity and fuels climate-neutral7 such as biomass of synthesis. Although significant benefits can still be achieved in terms of energy efficiency this extensive electrification will lead to an increase in the demand for electricity compared to until today. We will therefore ensure that our electricity system produces enough carbon-free electricity to support other sectors in their decarbonization through a transition to electrification. In addition to carbon-free electricity and climate-neutral fuels produced from renewable sources will naturally also have an important role to play in the energy landscape of tomorrow. All over Europe represent 50% of final energy consumption. Projections to 2050 indicate that this energy vector will remain at least as important. The thermal energy will therefore have to make a significant contribution to achieving energy and climate goals. In addition to the electrification of heating and cooling (e.g. heat pumps) maximum the present residual heat potential. Climate-neutral fuels meet the excess heat demand. The role of heat and cold produced from from renewable sources will also be further discussed under industry sectors construction and agriculture. 7 These Are Solid State Power Sources no net impact on the climate: biomass ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// page 15 of 47 Flemish climate strategy for 2050 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:14) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:17) (cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21) (cid:24)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:25)(cid:24)(cid:21) (cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:2)(cid:26)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:29)(cid:21) (cid:21)(cid:18)(cid:30) (cid:18)(cid:33)(cid:31)(cid:22)(cid:27)3.1.2 Éléments constitutifs Maximum use of local and renewable energy sources in 2050 renewable: wind energy respect outraged The planning policy facilitates the transition to renewable energy as much as possible. In addition to electricity are energy. Towards a decentralized and flexible electricity system Energy sources such as wind and sun have the disadvantage of not being able to meet our energy needs on a continuous basis due to their variable production. The increase in these sources in the electricity mix therefore entails a major challenge in terms of security of supply. We therefore bet centralized offering much more flexibility consumption to the availability of renewable sources. In the future energy market will be adapted in such a way as to sufficiently reflect the responsibilities of all actors in the Marlet. The concept of local energy communities will provide a facilitating framework for this. Seasonal energy storage and flexible generation facilities During long cold periods flexible security of supply. For those moments when few energy sources renewables (both domestic and foreign) are able to supply electricity develop other flexible seasonal storage applications and measures and make them accessible. Conversely renewable can be converted to gas or liquid fuel (Power-to-X) Import of electricity and climate-neutral fuels Densely populated and marked by a significant presence of high-intensity industries energy 90% of the energy.

Flanders will develop the strategies necessary to continue working towards affordable energy sources guaranteed supply and competitive. 3.2 INDUSTRY 3.2.1  Ambition Flemish energy-intensive industry is the driving force of the economy of Flanders and is a substantial source of added value and jobs. Similarly products and materials required that enable reductions in other sectors (eg. for renewable energy parks and efficient, zero-emission vehicles and homes etc.) and will continue to play this role in the future as well. in parallel still today a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions and a conversion towards more climate-friendly production systems will be necessary. Also do we have the ambition to support our Flemish industry of climate-friendly production while maintaining and strengthening the major role it plays in the economy of Flanders. Indeed, it would be of little use to carry out the reductions targeted by offshoring production if this leads to a net increase global emissions (e.g. increased emissions for freight transport). Instead and place only focus on our small share of global emissions contribute to the fight against global climate change. For our industry outside the ETS – which is not covered by the ETS emission ceiling – greenhouse gas emissions to 1 eq. Achieving this ambition requires a reversal of the trend that new efficiency improvements thrust. In this regard based on the use of fossil fuels as primary energy sources and materials raw. By mobilizing resources for the development of new technologies and new, innovative and climate-neutral production processes industrial transition. In consultation with the sectors concerned for the export of our technological solutions that contribute to meeting the climate challenge. By this lever positive to the global transition to a climate-neutral society the simple reduction of our territorial emissions its industry. 3.2.2 Components The formulas that have allowed us to reduce emissions over the past thirty years are not enough not make the transition to a low-emission industry.

Within the industrial sector make the conversion to a low-emission industry. In Flanders following axes: Ongoing commitment to efficiency improvements In the first place energy and process improvements. Through a targeted industrial energy efficiency policy in Flanders energy-intensive will receive the impetus needed to invest in measures energy saving. In addition to new short-term reductions energy supply and independence while also strengthening the competitiveness. By 2050 no longer be used within industry will be allocated to the heating of buildings via networks heat. The circular economy as a basic framework Extensive use of the circular economy can make a very significant contribution to our climate ambitions. A study conducted by Material Economics estimates the potential of reduction for European industry to 56% by 2050. Recycling of plastics (instead of cremation) reductions would be more cost effective and provide additional benefits in terms of energy consumption reduction on the supply side. We are therefore committed to a fully circular economy by 2050. We by this we mean that the products are manufactured with a reduced input of raw materials minimum is extended as much as possible (through sustainable design and repairs) and that at the end of life The natural cycle of the circular economy generates goods and services from materials organics inside a closed circuit. By increasing the use of sustainable biomass in industry to the creation of new local value chains. By encouraging their use in applications for longer life also an important carbon storage.

We therefore rely on the proximity of companies that manufacture sustainable products life for reuse and recycling. In this way manufacturers have access to a local pool of reusable and recyclable raw materials. By 2050 is almost no longer practiced. Waste collectors and processors have become suppliers of new raw materials who advise their customers in order to use the flows of materials as efficiently as possible. Only the non-transformable residues resulting from these recycling processes are still eligible for incineration or landfill. Incineration therefore only takes place in facilities ensuring high-quality recovery of the energy released. Conversion to renewable and climate-friendly fuels and raw materials neutral Right now and natural gas. In the future the industry will partly switch to climate-neutral fuels. To the extent that this makes sense from an economic point of view also lead to a drastic reduction in emissions. We can use sustainable biomass as a source of carbon molecules in the sector of chemistry. In doing so high added value. This valorization of the biomass must be favored over its combustion for energy purposes. Electrolysis can turn water into sustainable hydrogen using electricity. This molecule can be used as raw material in chemistry nitrogen or CO2 for the production of raw materials such as ammonia and methanol.

We see an increase the number of cars on Flemish roads with a very low occupancy rate (1 on average per car). Result: high energy consumption and direct emissions high (because practically empty cars are circulating) carbon and materials related to car production especially in big cities transport. We are therefore betting on a shift towards combined and shared mobility. By combined mobility transport and the most durable. Shared mobility means that vehicles are no longer used by just one person. It can take several forms: in addition to conventional transport hence the sharing of vehicles (several successive drivers use the same vehicle) and journeys (several passengers share a vehicle In order to achieve an optimally functioning mobility system the realization of an integrated multimodal transport system in such a way that travelers and the carrier can easily combine the different modes of transport and choose time and for each trip transport) the most suitable.

We are, however, aiming for a full transition to zero-emission vehicles by 2050 eu in view of the rapid developments in zero-emission propulsion systems and the growing research conducted in this area greening of rail transport and inland navigation is necessary because these fashions will retain their enduring character. Regarding rail transport that we will use energy-efficient electric trains everywhere.

In this regard type of building intermediaries. The systematic exploitation of the potential of the change of ownership is a excellent opportunity to encourage the owner to give more weight to the works of energy renovation in its overall renovation project. A neighborhood-level approach generates economies of scale and efficiency gains. If the renovation offers insufficient potential and/or proves to be too costly demolition and reconstruction of housing without heritage value energy-intensive buildings with buildings that meet strict energy standards. In such cases persist undesirable situations at this level. New non-residential constructions will also be subject to BEN requirements from 2021 (p. ex. existing sanitary Energy costs in non-residential buildings are usually only one very limited fraction of the total operating costs so that the improvement of the energy performance of the building does not constitute owners/managers. Gold increased for customers and workers. It is therefore crucial to put more emphasis on the positive efforts to improve energy performance to achieve energy savings in non-residential buildings. Spatial aspects and more efficient use of the building stock In addition to a better insulated envelope and more efficient heating installations emphasis on a series of spatial aspects – such as flexibility orientation – to further limit the energy needs of our building stock. We we thus grant as much as possible the buildings and their users so as not to extend the building stock unnecessarily create adaptive and flexible buildings. That means adapt more easily to different phases of life or that people move to different more compact and less energy-consuming dwellings when they no longer need their dwelling more spacious (eg. companies use their floor space as efficiently as possible (thanks to flexible working methods) or that buildings are used more efficiently and shared (for example school hours).

Biomass policy In the various sectors, we are implementing a policy in terms of biomass grafted onto the waterfall principle. We develop well-constructed tools that encourage people to make choices regarding the destination and reallocation of biomass, always based on climate and carbon storage considerations. The longer the life of the products from of biomass is long frequent and quality the use of biomass for long-term applications that can be subject to a quality recycling. We also encourage the use of biomass for the production of materials that will allow us to make savings on materials with high intensity carbon like steel and concrete (= substitution effect). Biomass harvesting always remains within sustainable ecological limits. In the context of a changing climate the ecosystem that produces the biomass take into account the effect on soil carbon stock. 4 TOWARDS A CLIMATE-PROOF FLANDERS While we want emissions in order to limit the impact of climate change as much as possible also manage the effects already perceptible and measurable to date and the future effects of the climate change. The starting point is the robustness of the environment. To do this of the main effects of climate change in Flanders. 4.1 MAIN EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN FLANDERS Greenhouse gas emissions cause climate change. In Flanders the beginning of the surveys in the 19th century of 2 the 70's faster than annual precipitation And mean sea level at the coast is now 13cm higher than it was in the early 1950s. ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// page 34 of 47 Flemish climate strategy for 2050 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:14) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:17) (cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21) (cid:24)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:25)(cid:24)(cid:21) (cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:2)(cid:26)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:29)(cid:21) (cid:21)(cid:18)(cid:30) (cid:32)(cid:22)(cid:31)(cid:22)(cid:27)En outre Flanders. Based on the most recent data annual average in Flanders continues to rise with heat. Total annual precipitation is estimated to increase wetter and drier summers. Not just averages the intensity of extreme weather events can change. A decrease in the amount of precipitation in summer and an increase in evaporation during the summer months increase the risk of extreme drought (as in 1976 and 2018) by one times every 50 years in the current climate to once every four to five years in 2100. This can lead to a decrease in low water flows damage to agriculture and jeopardize the supply of drinking water. The extent to which the climate change outlined above will actually pursue and its speed depend closely on the success of a global policy of reduction greenhouse gas emissions and the transition to a climate-neutral society. But to offset the potential effects and impact on humans at least mitigate them evolutionary adaptation. 4.2 TOWARDS A CUSTOMPROOF ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY WEATHER As it is possible that Europe climate change due to increased emissions in other continents Flandre must prepare for adaptation. In order to prepare Flanders for the expected effects of climate change described above the next legislature. In this regard, we rely on a global and integrated approach in all sectors policies. The adaptation plan will be based on the following pillars. 4.2.1 Preserve and expand unpaved open space As we described above long periods of drought arm against this risk Flanders and increase water infiltration and the retention capacity of the Flemish landscape and thus play a role of climatic buffer: in periods of intense precipitation soil and recharge underground water reserves prolonged dry spells. It is therefore absolutely necessary to reduce the additional spatial footprint to create a climate-proof space. That is why we make sure that the increase in yield of current land use is more attractive than spatial development. We also bet on a reduction of the stonework for infiltration (also in current land use) providing more leeway for river and stream valleys ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// page 35 of 47 Flemish climate strategy for 2050 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:14) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:17) (cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21) (cid:24)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:25)(cid:24)(cid:21) (cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:2)(cid:26)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:29)(cid:21) (cid:21)(cid:18)(cid:30) (cid:32)(cid:33)(cid:31)(cid:22)(cid:27) libérant de l'espace pour les bassins-tampons resilience of water and soil systems.

Specific coastal ecosystems such as slikkes and salt marshes and dunes take on a major importance in the protection against flooding by the sea. However ecosystems are currently caught in a vice between the increasing erosion on the sea side part (‘coastal constriction’). In consultation with the coastal municipalities and taking into account other aspects such as the importance of tourism and the socio-economic impact giving these ecosystems the latitude they need to adapt and self-regulate relative to sea level rise. 4.2.2 A space adapt to climate change Adaptation of our space to climate change The strategic vision of the Spatial Policy Plan for Flanders sets out some objectives important strategic issues such as limiting the net additional spatial footprint 2025 (today riprap by 2050 and at least a 1/5 reduction in riprap in space open. The open space will thus be able to continue to provide society with the raw materials resilience and necessary ecosystem services such as climate regulation. It requires multifunctional and solid open space areas among others We are giving greater leeway to river and stream valleys and make restoration management possible at the valley level. Besides water levels underground more stable can also again induce the active formation of peatlands and thus the increase in soil carbon concentrations. We reduce unwanted activity in these areas of valley. Appropriate spatial planning can offset shocks such as floods and storms. periods of drought or heat.

The impact that will also this transition on global warming depends on the efforts of all the countries same for the most part European and global level. 5.1 INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT The transition will be supported to a large extent by innovation and development technological. We already have many technologies today that allow us to reduce our energy consumption neutral and limit to be able to achieve our ambitions for 2050 advancements in technologies that are currently still in the R&D or testing and conditions conducive to the deployment of these technologies on a large scale. In this regard necessary to actively support new but promising technologies and innovations in their development until they reach sufficient maturity to able to play their role without further support. - The electricity sector recorded in terms of renewable energy production efficiency and considerable price reductions for wind and solar energy. the next challenge lies in the breakthrough of technologies and innovations to integrate these large-scale intermittent energy sources in our energy system demand management and efficient long-term energy storage play a role important to play. - In industrial sectors innovative technologies that will be further developed especially produce large quantities of climate-neutral hydrogen which can then used as fuel or raw material in industry. These innovations will require a lot of climate-neutral energy and will therefore be a mainstay important on which we will rely.

Backed by the presence of strong knowledge institutions innovative companies leader in the development of new technologies and innovative practices contributing to our climate ambitions. The public authorities provide their support by focusing on on an ambitious research and innovation policy. Flanders, however, is not alone in supporting technological research and advances innovative to contribute to the climate challenge. Our neighboring countries international organizations are also committed to it. Flanders therefore advocates very close cooperation at bilateral levels 5.2 A COHERENT POLICY FRAMEWORK CREATING THE RIGHT INCENTIVES AND ATTENTIVE TO COMPETITIVENESS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE To make the transition a success i.e. that encourages citizens and businesses to make climate-friendly choices and discourages high-emission production methods and consumption patterns. Several means are possible: establishment of standards sufficient and affordable supply of climate-friendly alternatives. Similarly legal and/or fiscal obstacles to the development of new products and services likely to play a role in the transition to a low-carbon society will be deleted. If needed adapting the product standards in force to facilitate this process. Besides rely on partnerships with “ambassadors” who actively relay these messages and set up networks to guide groups of citizens and businesses towards climate-friendly choice. The main challenge lies in the energy transition by which the demand for energy which day alternative.

This can lead to a loss of competitiveness for the sectors Flemish companies in competition with foreign companies which are not subject to a policy climate change and/or at a similar carbon cost. This is the case energy-intensive Flanders and for the Flemish agricultural sector. This is why we take into account the competitiveness of these sectors. As long as other regions do not impose efforts similar to their industry and/or agriculture against the risk of carbon leakage. The transition to a society with low greenhouse gas emissions also has a important social dimension. Lower income categories and vulnerable groups cannot always afford to switch to more climate-friendly alternatives (eg. heat pumps lower incomes and vulnerable groups in the transition to more climate-friendly (eg. full support). By supporting specific weaker target groups in the transition the quality of life of these target groups (e.g. by investing in better housing better insulated quality do not have a private car and losers at the industry level.

Increased electrification requires significant investments in new climate-neutral production capacity electricity and in the interconnections with our neighboring countries. To achieve a transport of people free of emissions cycling infrastructure and charging stations in order to provide sufficient and reliable to combustion engine private cars. Rail should also be invested in and waterways in order to further green our freight transport and create connections fast and comfortable rail between EU cities as an attractive alternative to air transport. The building sector will significantly deepen and accelerate renovations from current levels colossal. Significant reductions in Flemish industry while preserving activity industry can only be achieved through large-scale investment in the extensive renovation of existing facilities and construction of new facilities of high-tech production with low greenhouse gas emissions. At last also requires the development of an infrastructure for transporting residual flows (including the CO2) and waste heat so that they can be recovered and recovered as much as possible within and between different sectors. In this context opportunities offered by natural investment cycles. Estimated investment needs Various studies have made estimates of the cost of investment for the sectors concerned. The results of these studies are not always comparable due to the fact that they are based on different assumptions (including geographical coverage – Flanders / Belgium baseline scenario and political scenario ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// page 43 of 47 Flemish climate strategy for 2050 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:14) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:17) (cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21) (cid:24)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:25)(cid:24)(cid:21) (cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:2)(cid:26)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:29)(cid:21) (cid:21)(cid:18)(cid:30) (cid:22)(cid:32)(cid:31)(cid:22)(cid:27)The estimates give an idea of the order, however the size of the investments required.

Besides Flanders considers it important that all EU funding is consistent with the medium- and long-term climate and energy objectives. This assumes that only projects that do not create blockages and do not have a negative effect on our ability to achieve objectives in the long term can still be financed in the future by European resources. The existing funding programs such as the Common Agricultural Policy and the program ERDF13 Flanders will contribute more to the achievement of climate objectives. Besides authorities and stakeholders will make maximum use of funding sources European (such as LIFE innovation etc.) for projects contributing to the transition towards a climate-friendly Flanders neutral.

Achieving a circular economy can contribute significantly to the reduction of direct Flemish (territorial) emissions p. ex. by reducing the share of primary raw materials in industrial products limiting the number of vehicle-kilometres (with an emphasis on shared mobility and combined) reducing food losses extremely difficult the circular economy contributes – at least as significantly – to reducing our carbon and material footprint and therefore global greenhouse gas emissions and can create local economic opportunities and jobs. ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// page 47 of 47 Flemish climate strategy for 2050 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:14) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:17) (cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21) (cid:24)(cid:23)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:25)(cid:24)(cid:21) (cid:24)(cid:21)(cid:2)(cid:26)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:28)(cid:21)(cid:29)(cid:21) (cid:21)(cid:18)(cid:30) (cid:22)(cid:27)(cid:31)(cid:22)(cid:27) LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR WALLONIA (SLT 2050) “TOWARDS A CLIMATE-RELATED WALLONIA NEUTRAL IN 2050 » DOCUMENT APPROVED BY THE GOVERNMENT WALLON 5 DECEMBER 2019 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:14) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:17) (cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:24)(cid:18)(cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:2)(cid:25)(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:21)(cid:28)(cid:21) (cid:21)(cid:29)(cid:30) (cid:29)(cid:31)(cid:32)(cid:33)Table des matières 1.

The deadlines required by the European Regulation did not make it possible to carry out this consultation with the representatives of the different sectors and stakeholders An extended participatory procedure will be carried out in order to mobilize citizens. The Walloon long-term strategy for 2050 is based on several structural elements the study “Towards a low-carbon Wallonia in 2050”1 carried out in 2011. This study identified pathways to a low-carbon economy and analyzed the implications of reduction targets 80% to 95% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 compared to 1990. Then February 2014 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the short term tracking tools. Only the 95% reduction target by 2050 can contribute to stabilizing temperatures at +1.5°C compared to pre-industrial times. According to the expert committee of the available global budget results in a cumulative emissions budget of 516 Mt CO2 over the period 2018-2050 for Wallonia. This objective is confirmed by the Policy Statement regional 2019-2024 which aims for carbon neutrality in 2050 thanks to the 95% reduction provided for by the Decree The reduction target in 2050 compared to 1990 implies reaching annual emissions emissions of 2.8 MtCO2e (target of -95%) in 2050. From 1990 to 2017 annual were 1.4%/year whereas they should be 2 2 higher between what has been achieved and what remains to be achieved. It should also be noted that the reductions observed between 1990 and 2017 can be explained by various factors therefore not allow a trend to be defined until 2050. In addition stable since 2014 Consequently non-ETS sector by 35% compared to 2005 in 2030) and in the long term (reduction of gas emissions greenhouse gases by 80 to 95% in 2050) will require the implementation of policies particularly ambitious. The energy sector is a central element of this strategy and will be completely decarbonized thanks to improved energy efficiency 1 Climact (2011) Climate cited in the text as “Wallonia-low Carbon”.

This objective change is allied with the need to continue to provide citizens and businesses with secure energy sustainable and affordable Regarding energy efficiency resources are central and will require the implementation of multiple renovation projects. The production of electricity and heat will be based on a balanced mix of available technologies and import of electricity. A balanced vision of the energy system will go through a electrification of certain uses but also by the development of renewable sources for the direct heat generation also recovery of waste heat. Sector coupling will contribute to ensuring the balance and security of the energy system by transition. The total decarbonization of the energy system is based on three pillars which are: decentralization of electricity production end-sector consumption. The integration of the Belgian electricity system into the system European electricity will be strengthened. Energy storage will also be an essential element. On the side of the building emissions long-term objective is that all the buildings will reach the level of performance A on average in 2050. At the same time ensure the balance of the energy supply carbon in 2050. At the industrial level Walloon industrial sector has a long-term vision of its own activities. Many elements emerge indisputably: beyond the improvement of energy efficiency and shift towards renewable energies increasing carbon capture options (CCS / CCU) Switch) and sectoral integration (Sector coupling)). The ETS system will have to play a major role in the transition and ensure a level-playing field at European level in order to guarantee the competitiveness of businesses. Wallonia will continue the efforts begun to ensure the structural deployment circular economy in Wallonia added and employment. Transport is the only area where both CO emissions and energy consumption are 2 growing since 1990. This development is linked to the increase in road traffic and a relative stagnation or even decline in public transport modes. By 2050 completely decarbonized and better management of demand) and the transition to electrical energy sustainable biogas. For the transport of goods waterway will result in less congestion. A share of non-biosourced fuels is however reserved in 2050 for air and sea transport recycled or synthetic fuels from CO (e-fuels). The modal shift 2 adapted will make it possible to reduce the modal share of the automobile Public transport is one of the most important drivers to guarantee the decarbonisation of the sector. Needs that cannot be satisfied by public transport will then rely on shared vehicles whether or not they are autonomous. Transport will represent a social or even societal challenge to avoid the cleavage between the citizens of the cities where the supply of public transport should increase to replace personal cars and Towards a climate-neutral Wallonia 5 Version approved by the GW on 5/12/2019 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:14) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:17) (cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:24)(cid:18)(cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:2)(cid:25)(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:21)(cid:28)(cid:21) (cid:21)(cid:29)(cid:30) (cid:32)(cid:31)(cid:32)(cid:33)citizens of rural areas for whom moving will become restrictive even for journeys waste when carpooling and telecommuting have met a first part of the needs. This is a major challenge that absolutely needs to be addressed. Agriculture will always result in greenhouse gas emissions other than CO 2 can be reduced by 2050 through efficient and sustainable production methods. According to the “low-carbon Wallonia” study Innovation will play an increasingly important role, particularly with intelligent/smart agriculture farming net zero emissions will require increasing amounts of biomass relative to the current consumption that could further diversify current agricultural activity. At last carbon in forest biomass and agricultural and forest soils around 3% of the Region's annual emissions. This absorption could be slightly reinforced potential for increasing the well remains limited given the occupation of the territory. CCS/CCU should therefore be used to offset residual emissions. The transformation of the Walloon economy will have to be part of a fair and equitable transition in terms of jobs and access to energy. Both local authorities and citizens will have a central role to play in the development of a low-carbon society. All these transformations will therefore be based on changes in behavior businesses. Local authorities will be involved because governance operates at the scale of the agglomeration or living areas and their role in mobilizing and inciting the actors of their territory. The Strategy is also based on an evolution of the development of the Walloon territory built on four objectives: the fight against urban sprawl and the rational use of territories and resources mobility. Research policies and measures will aim to improve the sustainability of the goods produced and to integrate them into a virtuous logic circular economy progressive circular materials use standards efficiency is essential development and adoption of disruptive technologies with the aim of reducing and eventually eliminate residual emissions. In terms of adaptation important and drier and hotter summers very heavy rainfall as well as an increase in the number of days of summer heat waves. The main risks identified relate to flooding sanitary facilities during heat waves climatic conditions and pests) and finally the vulnerability of energy systems (peaks of consumption related to air conditioning water management preservation of biodiversity and improving the resilience of ecosystems and agrosystems and finally developing a resilient energy system to sufficient interconnections and varied flexibility solutions. Synergies and trade-offs will be needed between mitigation and adaptation measures.

Study identifies pathways to a low-carbon economy and analyzes the implications of “decarbonization” objectives, i.e. an 80% to 95% reduction greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2050 compared to 19906. The results of this study are important bases of the SLT 2050. February 19, 2014 targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the short term term in particular the development of emission “budgets” for 5-year periods and the establishment of a Committee of Experts. The latter submits opinions on the proposed issue budgets and on the policies that make it possible to respect them7. The objectives set by this decree are as follows: • A 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 by 2020; • An 80 to 95% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 by 2050. The Regional Policy Declaration of Wallonia 2019-2024 (DPR) recalls that the urgency climate change and environmental degradation are such that society as a whole is called upon to fundamentally change their behavior. Wallonia is part of the necessary evolution and desirable towards a low-carbon society. It aims for carbon neutrality by 2050 at the latest. intermediate step of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% compared to 1990 by 2030. To achieve this climate target of 55% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 will launch a broad participatory process PACE (Air Climate Energy Plan) for the medium and long term.

Long-term strategic objectives The long-term Walloon strategy is part of the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The Agreement of Paris commits the Parties to contain global warming well below 2°C and to pursue the action to limit it to 1 Wallonia “Art. 4. This decree aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by: 1° 30 per cent of CO2 equivalents compared to the quantity of the reference year by 2020; 2° 80 to 95 percent CO2 equivalents of the base year quantity by 2050. The government sets reach for 2050 according to international or European obligations. Otherwise target percentage is 95 percent. » In its latest special report on “global warming of 1.5°C” updated its estimate of available carbon budgets globally. Relative to estimates in the 5th IPCC report sources of uncertainty. The opinion of the Committee of Experts allows further reflection to refine this objective. The Committee proposes to base its estimate on the global cumulative emissions budget allowing to have a 66% chance of staying below 2°C (1170 GtCO2 as of 2018) and that allowing to have 50% chance of staying under 1 be deemed more appropriate to aim for higher percentages in terms of the chance of remaining under the temperature thresholds defined in the Paris Agreement. Note that these carbon budget values concern all anthropogenic CO2 emissions but not the other GHGs (the effect of the latter on the temperature is however taken into account based on scenarios included in the work of the IPCC). On this basis temperatures at +1.5°C compared to pre-industrial times of 516 Mt CO2 over the period 2018-2050 for Wallonia8. In his DPR of 95% provided for by the Decree supplemented by carbon capture measures with CCU and negative emissions (BECCS). This climate objective is combined with the need to continue to provide citizens and businesses with a safe energy contribute according to their specificities. The energy sector is central and will be completely of carbon. The “Wallonia Low Carbon” study enables Wallonia to build a Long-Term Strategy based on a "back casting" type approach: the study explores various trajectories compatible with reduction target from 80% to 95% by 2050. Different levers are mentioned: change of behviour electricity 100% from renewable sources The “low-carbon Wallonia” approach has been updated on the basis of various expert judgments and other more recent studies. 8http://awac.be/images/Pierre/Chgt_climatique/pol_wallonne/2019%2002%2022%20- % 20Avis% 20no5_PWEC.pdf Towards a climate-neutral Wallonia 9 Version approved by the GW on 5/12/2019 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:14) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:17) (cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:24)(cid:18)(cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:2)(cid:25)(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:21)(cid:28)(cid:21) (cid:21)(cid:29)(cid:30) (cid:33)(cid:31)(cid:32)(cid:33)2.1 Réduction totale des émissions de Gaz à effet de serre et enhancement of absorptions by sinks 2.1.1.

Reinforcement of absorptions Several research projects are underway to ensure the maintenance and enhancement of the carbon sink forest This research has not yet resulted in specific recommendations.

The region will ensure that the intensity of biomass harvesting is compatible with maintaining and enhancing uptakes by forest ecosystems particularly with regard to wood energy in the context of renewable energies. A thought will be initiated to define the methods for verifying this condition. CCS/CCU should therefore be used to compensate for residual emissions.

That being possible scenarios for a low carbon transition of the Region according to an objective of 80% indicates that the building sector has a very high potential contribution to enable the Region to reduce its emissions (Figure 2). 2.2. The deployment of renewable energies The long-term Walloon strategy is based on a target of 100% renewable energy on the horizon 2050. Any remaining thermal power plants will have to be associated with a capture of carbon. Given the low potential of the Walloon Region in the various energy sources renewable of electricity. Any potential increase in the intensity of forest biomass harvesting must also remain compatible with the long-term maintenance and reinforcement of the carbon (see point 2.1.1). The production of electricity and heat must exploit all technological possibilities available energy as a whole will go through the electrification of certain uses but also through the valorization of renewable sources for the direct production of heat. In effect electrification is commonly accepted as a way forward for both the transport sector that the heat supply heat or cold from renewable sources.

The whole will be based on a global mechanism of guarantees of origin compatible from one sector/vector to another. What's more be carried out in parallel so as to avoid making excessive new investments for meet peak consumption in winter given the seasonal difference in energy needs heat. 2.3. Energy efficiency first Energy efficiency is the key to a cheap transition The energy efficiency objective is aimed at a significant reduction in consumption energy end. Energy efficiency sustainably reduces the amount of energy needed while improving long term the standard of living of the citizens. The use of all the energy efficiency levers at across demand sectors will reduce final consumption by 50 TWh by 205011 compared to final consumption of 120 TWh in 2017 or 140 TWh in 2005. This reduction supported by changes in behavior and technological advances compensate for any increase in demand for electricity (high growth scenario). What's more electrification from renewable sources reduces energy consumption primary. Energy efficiency is an attractive lever induced. The investment costs which can sometimes be significant are compensated individual indirect in terms of comfort and quality of life, for example in the case of buildings renovated. But above all drastically the investment needs in the energy production sector potentially local employment and therefore budgetary income and induces significant savings health care budgets. The attractiveness of these measures is contrasted by the difficulty of their implementation. Numerous blockages exist and therefore require the establishment of support mechanisms. The main behavioral change consists in favoring a logic of consumption minimum which can be done at a lower cost but requires a profound change of reference The implementation of energy efficiency measures is central to the rational use of resources and requires the implementation of multiple renovation projects. At last of the building will make it easier to heat it and reduce energy bills. 11 Low Carbon Wallonia Towards a climate-neutral Wallonia 13 Version approved by the GW on 5/12/2019 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:14) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:17) (cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:24)(cid:18)(cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:2)(cid:25)(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:21)(cid:28)(cid:21) (cid:21)(cid:29)(cid:30) (cid:29)(cid:34)(cid:31)(cid:32)(cid:33)3.

Future vision The 2050 vision for the energy sector is based on total decarbonization being entirely based on renewable energies. Any thermal power plants remaining must be associated with carbon capture. This climate objective is combined with the need to continue to provide citizens and businesses with secure energy affordable. All sectors are impacted by this transition and contribute to it according to their specificities. The total decarbonization of the energy system is based on three pillars which are: decentralization electricity production end sectors when appropriate and there is no more efficient solution. These three trends provide solutions but also constitute major challenges. They should allow the integration of large shares of variable renewable energy into the network while guaranteeing security of energy supply for citizens and businesses at low prices affordable/competitive. In particular, this will require participation and accountability (empowerment) of the consumer-actor. It will be important to promote synergies between the renewable local production and consumption in order to strengthen the system in parallel with the implementation of flexibility measures12. The integration of the Belgian electricity system into the European electricity system will be reinforced. the electricity production sector has a strong European dimension and it is important to maximize the strengths and synergies of Member States in order to pool efforts redundancies and to guarantee a minimum societal cost. A coherent strategy must combine the bet in place and the vision and implementation at European level13. 3.1.3. Guidelines safe energy Even if it is an essential element of the decarbonization of our economy energy is also of strategic importance which requires ensuring a secure energy supply 12 Cf.

Safe because network adaptation measures when needed flexibility and storage will have been implemented. Sustainable thanks to a renewable energy mix in which biomass will play a measured role. Affordable in order to guarantee access to energy for all citizens and the competitiveness of businesses and thus contribute to guaranteeing the fairness and fair transition A renewable mix The deployment of renewable energies for the production of electricity will be reinforced whether through incentives when they are still needed even by regulatory acts. This deployment will have to be carefully planned in consultation with the Federal State to be compatible with a temporary increase in the production of natural gas power plants Renewable energies for the production and recovery of heat will be deployed structured way. In effect heat generation air conditioner. All these consumptions must be of renewable origin whether they are pumps heat to supply cities. In a concrete way individuals to favor the installation of high-performance heat pumps (including in terms of concerning refrigerants) geothermal. For apartment buildings or using waste heat should be a priority. The use of biomass resources for energy production will be supported and supervision reinforced in order to preserve the sustainability of the biomass. The impact of global warming on our forest resources and water availability will be taken into consideration (see chapter 7 “A Resilient Wallonia”). The use of biomass will be done in respect of the context environmental sector. To do this, a strategy for mobilizing biomass as well as a strategy for bio-based economic development will have been put in place at the level of the Region and in coordination with neighboring regions. A decentralized system The establishment of a decentralized energy production system is a key element of the energy transition involving the consumer. He will have to participate in the implementation of flexibility of energy demand to facilitate the integration of new energy sources. The promotion and establishment of citizen or renewable energy communities constitutes an opportunity to allow direct involvement of the citizen and therefore acceptance of the upcoming transition. The same goes for self-consumption mechanisms. which will allow access to energy production from renewable sources for residents of apartment buildings A flexible energy system Current flexibility needs are mainly met by thermal power plants flexible. Their objective is to smooth the electricity demand curve by reducing both the peaks seasonal than daily consumption. By 2050 type of power plants will be taken to ensure continuous development of new centralized storage tools and decentralized units as well as load-moving services in industry and at home in order to ensure a better match between supply and demand.

These same meters will also provide better knowledge of consumption and will be the gateway to new services aimed both at decrease in consumption than its displacement. The development of smart grids is coupled with “smartization” and data management. There is no need to set goals about them tend their development: • Maximizing the accommodation capacity of infrastructures (for production tools and flexible tools) and synchronicity by aiming to optimize the collective well-being of the electrical system as a whole; • The remuneration of the networks based on performance indicators); A system that relies on digitization Digitization brings technical solutions to manage the integration of growing shares of renewable energy in the network and to include producer companies and citizens in the market. It nevertheless represents a considerable cost, in particular because of the infrastructure necessary to enable real-time data management. What's more data has already given rise to cybersecurity issues. At last data centers must also be taken into account. Reasoned electrification thanks to sector coupling and power-to-X Thanks to the deployment of competitive renewable electricity marked by electrification in many sectors such as heat And this fuels. This electrification will make it possible to recover surplus variable renewable electricity. This electrification will be based on sector coupling between the energy sector and the other building sectors gas and heat/air conditioning. In effect interconnected in order to allow the injection of an increasing share of renewable electricity into the network and its optimal valuation. This leads to the need to make the links between the production electricity either in the building (see chapter 3.2 The building) and through sectoral integration with transport and industry. The Power-to-X the balance and security of the energy system, in particular through the production of green hydrogen (cf. Lower). The future of networks The deployment of the energy transition will be based on the capitalization of infrastructures 14 “Definitions: Coupling of end-use sectors involves the electrification of the energy demand associated with the strengthening the interaction between energy supply and end use.

On the side of the electrical network less centralized or even autonomous and the other towards the possible implementation of a transport network on a European scale. The possible appearance of gigantic renewable production capacities offshore or on more remote European islands in the North where the wind conditions are better ones will indeed require hydrogen will play a significant role. (see below) Integrated management at European level will be necessary in order to allow better harmonization and optimization of the electricity market. With a reduction in the consumption of natural gas (in particular a reduction in the consumption residential sector for heat production) reassessed with regard to the development of biogas A concrete vision of the future must be developed in order to maintain an interesting and sustainable over time. Storage solutions Storage solutions needed for different time horizons will have to be deployed balanced way. First of all strategic reserves of electricity or buffers necessary for seasonal fluctuations in electricity production and consumption. By 2050 will coexist strategies will factor into the most important capabilities. It will be necessary to capitalize on the pumped storage capacities which constitute an option mature and easily planned. Storage capacities at the geological level remain possible and probably more easily reconciled with land use requirements. Batteries offer interesting potential in the secondary reserve and intraday, but this potential is very limited between seasons. It should also be noted that the development of the park electric car could also offer an interesting storage opportunity through of “vehicle-to-grid”. This principle makes it possible to use the batteries of electric cars as a relay of the electrical network. Two-way exchanges make it possible to use the car to store electricity or to restore this electricity as needed. This principle adapts to consumer demand electricity and therefore guarantee in partnership with electricians citizen could also find a winning solution. It will be possible to load your vehicle when the price of electricity is lowest (by definition at off-peak hours) to restore it when the price is higher. Heat storage (geothermal or other technologies) is often interesting in terms of particularly in the context of heat electrification. Hydrogen will play a role in this landscape as it is a storage and transport vector interesting for large renewable production capacities. Hydrogen The development of green hydrogen (therefore from renewable sources) will be supported and supervised.

The interest of hydrogen is to allow the storage of electricity over time, which opens up direct electrification prospects for entire sectors of the economy. However, care should be taken to use it with a minimum of transformations. Regarding transportation be widely used in the road sector (via fuel cells or thermally). All alternative using carbon should be limited to sectors that cannot be directly electrified which will effectively direct the effort. Typically synthetic (gaseous or liquid) will have to decrease after 2030 to become in 2050 only a substitute for heavy fuel oil and kerosene. Heavy industry should be eligible for investment for rapid conversion to complete decarbonization of combustion processes. Other sectors could also benefit from this shift towards green hydrogen: the ammonia industry compounds with high added value. This vision will remain complementary to retraining techniques du CO. 2 Towards a climate-neutral Wallonia 19 Version approved by the GW on 5/12/2019 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:14) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:17) (cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:24)(cid:18)(cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:2)(cid:25)(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:21)(cid:28)(cid:21) (cid:21)(cid:29)(cid:30) (cid:29)(cid:33)(cid:31)(cid:32)(cid:33)3.2.

The distributions of energy consumption and GHG emissions by sector are given in Figure 4 final consumption Figure 4. Sectoral distribution of energy consumption -- Provisional energy balance of Wallonia 2017 3.2.2. Vision of the future The study of possible scenarios for a low carbon transition in the Region indicates that the sector of building has a very high potential contribution to enable the Region to reduce its emissions. The “Wallonia Bas Carbone” study envisages a 90% to 100% reduction in emissions from building sector (-80% scenario). Nevertheless the strict new standards applied to construction or heavy renovation will not be enough to tangibly improve the performance of the sector by 2050. If we want to improve the energy performance of the sector the whole of the existing stock since the vast majority of them will still be present in 50 years”15. Most building components have a long lifespan. The components that have the most impact on energy consumption will only be renovated once by 2050. The investments must therefore be made in the right sequence different interventions realize their potential. Similarly in the future will have to directly reach the most demanding energy standards which will have to be reached in 2050. They must be 'future proof'. In view of these elements in achieving energy and climate goals. In effect energy efficiency by reducing consumption. It contributes to the achievement of objectives 15 Meyer S. and Marshal K.

This is why Wallonia has adopted a long-term renovation strategy (2050) consultation of stakeholders taking into account the characteristics of the building stock existing and specificities of the Region (cid:216) For the residential sector: aim in 2050 towards the PEB A label (Espec ≤ 85kWh/m²an) by average for the entire housing stock. (cid:216) For the tertiary sector: move towards an energy-neutral tertiary building stock in 2050 (zero energy) for heating The priorities proposed in the strategy correspond to the most cost-effective measures deep renovation of the least efficient housing (the insulation of the envelope the roofs however, be done by ensuring that any renovation project is part of a global reflection and consistent with the objectives of the Region and that it does not lead to the unavailability of accommodation. A phasing of the renovation rate to be achieved in order to target the 2050 objective is proposed in the strategy and declined in periods of 5 years. This phasing makes it possible to check whether Wallonia is in the right trajectory for the achievement of its objectives. Not all the buildings covered by the strategy will be able to achieve the objective formulated on average for the entire park and other more global avenues will have to be examined in the future. the expansion of the stock of new high-performance buildings is one of the elements that will contribute to improving the fleet and the overall objective. In this regard urban renewal policies which aim in particular to combat global warming climate change and “to optimize local production/resources and energy consumption”. New construction to overall goals. Around 15,000 new homes are expected each year add to the current stock of order 1 must also take into account emissions related to the construction of buildings. The phasing of the renovation takes into account the need to distribute the investments and to plan in prioritize investments with the greatest potential impact. Although the phasing of the renovation measures is determined on a case-by-case basis (in a roadmap renovation specific to each building) step-by-step deep energy renovation primarily targets the renovation of roofs then the envelope and finally the renovation of the systems and the installation of production sources of renewable energy. Beyond the fact that it will allow the reduction of GHG emissions from buildings and ultimately the use increased to renewable energy sources will generate significant co-benefits such as the creation and relocation of jobs comfort and indoor air quality of the park to meet future needs . 3.2.3.

By "deep renovation" we mean all work based on a reflection of the building and its use and an integrated approach implementing the solutions the most suitable and effective architectural and technical solutions to reduce significantly (from 75% to 100%) the energy consumption. This global reflection integrates times of sanitation targets and targets for reducing energy consumption environmental impacts of the building's life cycle16. Deep energy renovation in one go allows most renovation work to be included (sanitation work can be combined with the energy renovation budget. To achieve the average objective for the stock (PEB A label on average in 2050 for housing energy neutral for tertiary buildings) superior performance to compensate for those for which it will not be possible achieve a high level of energy performance (for technical reasons or heritage). It is therefore necessary to identify able to contribute to the general objective. For this purpose the long-term energy performance objective that it must achieve achieve and the renovation steps required to achieve this objective. This long-term objective and the renovation roadmap will be components of the building passport presented below. Among the strengthening measures part of the renovation strategy. These tools reflect the desire of the sector recurring during consultations coherent with the long-term objectives of Wallonia and guaranteeing supervision of the works of renovation. These tools are: • The roadmap: integrated into the Housing Audit renovation priorities to follow in order to achieve (primary con = 85Kwh / month) • The building passport: an interactive and evolving tool designed to support the building throughout throughout his life. It will centralize all the information related to the buildings and distributed according to various administrative aspects (localization stability studies certificat PEB • The one-stop shop: The one-stop shop will take over all the support services for energy/housing households. On the one hand, he can guide the household in the type of energy renovation to be carried out ensure that these are in line with the energy passport of the building support households in identifying entrepreneurs who will be able to carry out the works 16 Energy Performance of Buildings Directive: Major renovation is defined here as the work renovation of the envelope or systems the cost of which is at least 25% of the value of the building or aimed at renovating more than 25% of the building envelope.

Evolution Walloon industrial and economic development observed in recent years has led to the displacement of a economy essentially dominated by solid and liquid fuels towards an economy electrified. The trend towards electrification could strengthen due to the digitalization of the economy on the one hand and the growing share of data centers in the Walloon industrial landscape. 18 The use of the new IPCC guidelines (2006) leads to a reallocation of certain emissions: combustion directly linked to process emissions (lime kilns by example) are now accounted for in processes.

Vision for the future: Walloon industry is essential to the transition19 The 2050 Sector Roadmaps published in April 2018 showed that each industrial sector Walloon has a long-term vision of its own activities. This vision is essential for make existing activities sustainable by strengthening the economic attractiveness of Wallonia on new promising and essential segments in the sustainable economic transition. These consultations also highlighted the need for technological breakthroughs to ensure the transition. This aspect is difficult to predict by 2050 and underlines the need to periodically update the long-term strategy. Beyond the conventional purely sectoral approach new economic challenges in a changing world. A striking example of this situation, which requires constant reassessment, is the appearance in the industrial field of data centers in the Walloon Region future energy needs are often far removed from more traditional sectors such as extraction or processing. The future will go through a growing electrification of business sectors and a growing use carbon capture options (CCS/CCU). According to the “low carbon Wallonia” study (scenario -80%) major role in the transition and ensure at European level a “level playing field” or “rules of common games” in order to guarantee the competitiveness of companies Here are changes that could occur on this system by 2050. 3.3.3.

Fossil fuels will have been replaced by renewable energies and/or by a recourse increased by electricity instead of renewable hydrogen. Direct electrification has significant potential. The proportion will probably increase with the use of new technologies such as “Power-to- X” where hydrogen obtained via renewable energy sources can take a place growing. Replacing coal with biomass and biogas in industrial sectors still dependent on solid fuels (process industries for which no electrical solution would be possible) will be put in place. Ideally these resources must come from local channels and be fully integrated into the reflection industrial global. One of the other fundamental issues for the industry is heat management in the industrial process or in the use of heat as a recoverable resource. As such the development of industrial heating networks and the use of renewable fuels or bio-based products require increasing attention now economically sustainable such solutions. Support for companies in their process of transition to low-energy production systems carbon emissions and the development of new sectors with high added value will be based on the implementation of long-term strategies correlating aid systems with energy ambitions and climatic. These strategies will be integrated into a framework of action including a global reflection taking into account the entire economic chain (inputs each sector. They will be based on appropriate and optimal investment support tools by capitalizing on both public and private funding sources and opportunities. Those support mechanisms will allow industries to achieve their objectives but also to guarantee a favorable climate for their possible transformation towards a better integrated circular economy.

At- of the emitting sectors: - CO emissions related to combustion; 2 - CO emissions related to uses (for example the steam reforming of methane); 2 - CO emissions related to non-energy processes (typically 2 the cement industry). A circular economy Wallonia will develop a strategy for the development of the circular economy in order to ensure the structural deployment develop projects with added value and employment. New business models maximizing the value of raw materials in the economy and making an essential contribution to the overall objective of reducing the consumption of materials first should be preferred waste/residue streams. In this context energy of biological and non-biological materials must be able to be evaluated as a last resort of valuation.

Transport (Mobilité et Fret) 3.4.1. State of play Transport is the only area where both CO emissions and energy consumption are 2 growing since 2008. This development is linked to the increase in road traffic in Wallonia (+57% since 1990) and a relative stagnation or even decline in the use of other methods of public transport (whether transporting people or goods). Transport accounts for around 25% of Walloon energy consumption and carbon emissions. CO. If we remove the sectors covered by the ETS 2 Alone transport of passengers or transport of goods which represent respectively 60% and 40% of the total. However, it is important to emphasize the importance of transit traffic in Wallonia for merchandise Air freight transport represents a higher share than air transport of passengers. Various notable factors should be mentioned at the level of the vehicle fleet: - Despite a certain drop in the kilometers traveled per vehicle over time automotive continued to grow substantially at the same pace as the growth of the population. Only significant event for a few years fleet linked to a significant increase in the gasoline fleet and a very modest increase in alternative fuels - A fairly significant increase in light utility vehicles, which constitute 86% of the utility fleet following the introduction of the kilometer charge for passenger vehicles more than 3 3.4.2. Vision 2050 A fully decarbonized sector A l’horizon 2050 start with a reduction in mobility needs resulting from an evolution of the layout of the territory. This better management of demand will effectively lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of health. It will allow scenarios involving a substantial modal shift towards public transport and modes of active travel will allow cities to be relieved of congestion. The same for the transport of merchandise decrease in congestion. A growing share of shared and autonomous transport is clearly possible at this time horizon. Fuels, whatever their nature (electricity synthesis) will be of renewable origin. The objective of neutrality by 2050 requires a almost total decarbonization of the transport sector sustainable biofuels and biogas. However, a share of non-biosourced fuels is reserved in 2050 for air and maritime transport synthetic fuels derived from CO (e-fuels). 2 On the side of passenger transport A significant part of the modal shift could be achieved by using active modes to which infrastructures will have been developed throughout the Walloon territory and to public transport Towards a climate-neutral Wallonia 31 Version approved by the GW on 5/12/2019 (cid: 1) (cid: 2) (cid: 2) (cid: 3) (cid: 4) (cid: 5) (cid: 6) (cid: 7) (cid: 8) (cid: 9) (cid: 10) (cid: 11) (cid: 12) (cid: 7) (cid: 5) (cid: 3) (cid: 13) (cid: 7) (cid: 9) (cid: 14) (cid: 15) (cid: 16) (cid: 9) (cid: 17) (cid: 5) (cid: 11) (cid: 10) (cid: 12) (cid: 8) (cid: 17) (cid: 3) (cid: 18) (cid: 3) (cid: 19) (cid: 20) (cid: 3) (cid: 21) (cid: 22) (cid: 23) (cid: 21) (cid: 18) (cid: 23) (cid: 18) (cid: 21) (cid: 18) (cid: 21) (cid: 3) (cid: 24) (cid: 18) (cid: 21) (cid: 18) (cid: 21) (cid: 2) (cid: 25) (cid: 21) (cid: 26) (cid: 27) (cid: 21) (cid: 28) (cid: 21) (cid: 21) (cid: 29) (cid: 30) (cid: 34) (cid: 29) (cid: 31) (cid: 32) (cid: 33) commun. With module report reduce the modal share of the automobile as the sole mode of transport. This situation will be facilitated by the democratization of light electrified vehicles (bicycles Public transport is one of the most important drivers to ensure decarbonisation of the sector. Needs that cannot be met by public transport will rely on then on shared vehicles necessarily necessary in the urban environment thanks to different sharing concepts public transport system and its integration into "mobility as a service" (MAAS). Shared autonomous electric cars will enable on-demand mobility in areas less accessible and would allow people to transfer to the transit system at mobility nodes or to meet specific needs in urban areas. Electrification is approximately two to three times more efficient than thermal solutions in terms of fuel saving for vehicles. This option is a priority in the long term for passenger vehicles (100% of sales of new passenger vehicles will be electric at from 2040 in 2030 10% for private plug-in hybrid cars in new vehicle sales. Some efforts must also be deployed in terms of vehicle efficiency thermal vehicles by direct hybridization. Particular attention should be paid to the management of electricity demand in this fuel carryover and battery recyclability applied to transportation. Similarly social cohesion. In fact, it must be avoided that relating to mobility in an urban environment underserved rural areas proximity. In this context studied common). On the freight side In the transport of goods promote local production shortening of supply chains through more localized integrated production will allow a clear evolution in the environmental footprint of transport. It is the same of the latest segments in online sales that seems to be a definite threat to the impact they will have at the city level. The fight against breaks in load must be a priority by resorting mainly to transport goods by rail and river. For heavy road transport (through increased sector integration with hydrogen) and transport river and sea In the case of the transport of goods railways. Road freight transport would become the exception short and medium through zero-emission trucks. Goods destined for the city could then be consolidated in a distribution center located on the outskirts of the city and distributed with electric vans and cargo bikes.

Potential for electrification in the aviation sector exists significant breakthrough and offer interesting potential for local logistics with real electrification opportunity. Similarly started to appear in recent years and also make it possible to imagine an electrification term In the maritime sector extremely long and complicated in sea freight. Short-haul air travel will have been completely replaced by train travel or by bus (high speed). in 2050 long distance flights. Maritime transport could become electric for short distances and will use alternative fuels for long distances. Points d’attention In the transport sector will probably be the most important. The proportion of battery-powered vehicles will nevertheless have to probably be put into perspective by taking into account the risks of security of supply and network integrity. In effect consequent on the demand for electricity. The pure electric model for transport has never been designed to replace thermal vehicles for long journeys. It is indeed more particularly suitable for standard travel needs (less than 40km daily) and ideally combines with self-consumption models. For river and maritime transport here key for a rapid transformation in this sector. A social or even societal challenge How to avoid the divide between citizens of cities where the public transport offer should increase to replace personal cars and citizens in rural areas for whom traveling will become restrictive even for residual journeys when carpooling and teleworking will have met a first part of the needs? This is a major challenge that absolutely needs to be addressed. 3.4.3. Guidelines Three axes will form the guidelines: Axis 1: Rationalize mobility needs (Avoid); Axis 2: Encourage modal transfers (Shift); Axis 3: Improve vehicle performance (Improve).

It will involve stabilizing our trips in terms of passenger-km individual shared. To succeed modes of travel active modes22 motorized individuals. Improvements in energy efficiency and decarbonization will affect all modes of transport. As for the energy sector of the system (via MaaS or ITS). This digitization will enable intelligent traffic management and increasingly automated mobility in all modes occupancy rates. The slowdown imposed by shared multimodality will be offset by a reduced congestion which will improve the speed of other trips. Regional infrastructure and land use planning will need to be improved to take advantage of take full advantage of the increased use of public transport. Transitions in the transport sector will require an accelerated deployment of relevant infrastructure energy sources with smart charging or refueling stations enabling services homogeneous cross-borders. Future investments will have to focus on the least polluting modes by favoring synergies between transport networks. The development of high-speed rail links seems to be a real alternative to aviation for short and medium distance passenger travel within the EU. Eventually reduce the modal share of the private car from 83% in 2017 to 60% in 2030. An objective reduction to 40% in 2050 seems realistic The development of efficient and attractive public transport and the generalization of collective or shared mobility solutions will make it possible to strengthen the relative shares in soft mobility; increase from 13% to 50% of the relative share of public transport and from 1% to 10% of the relative share of bicycle trips by 2050 with an occupancy rate cars passing from 1 Improving the complementarity of modes of transport, in particular intermodal connection points by increasing their number relay by improving the accessibility of the gateways to Wallonia will also contribute to this reinforcement. In terms of regulation and governance including in a growing and dominant way the questions of mobility in general by including specific actions on the transport of goods is necessary. This approach should allow the 21The Anglo-Saxons call this Mobility As A Service (MAAS) and the Swiss call it combined mobility. 22That is to say walking and traditional cycling.

According to the Wallonia low carbon study (-80% scenario) conceivable. Innovation will play an increasingly important role. Intelligent agriculture/smart farming (Use of digital technologies in the agricultural sector) agriculture) will produce more with less input and less effort by linking practices farms to the personalized needs of crops and livestock.

A net-zero emissions economy will require increasing amounts of biomass per compared to current consumption (Clean Planet for All27 predicts an increase in consumption of bioenergy by about 80% by 2050 compared to today). The new demand for woody biomass could further diversify current agricultural activity. This will offer new opportunities for recultivation of marginal lands.

The share of animal protein in the consumer's diet would be in line with WHO recommendations advocating a diversified diet. Better co-ordination between producers and consumers using digital platforms will have made it possible to reduce food waste and loss. The use of packaging and transport in the food production has also been drastically reduced. CAP instruments will be used more for climate purposes. The eco-schemes of new common agricultural policy (CAP) must be put in place by the States for the farmers who engage in environmentally beneficial practices. They will contribute to stimulate carbon sequestration in the soil and better fight against drought and floods consequences of climate change. Investment subsidies within the framework of CAP rural development programs will fund the use of environmentally friendly techniques climate and air quality. CAP agri-environmental measures will be strengthened to support biodiversity and less intensive land use. Agricultural research remains important and can provide answers to the challenges.

Since then as well as for adaptation to climate change social justice. This reflection should be part of a dialogue with the stakeholders and the citizens. The global labor movement defines 'just transition' as 'a strategy of outreach to protect people whose employment compromise due to climate policies” but it is also “to support workers and communities affected by the negative effects of climate change and training to ensure decent and good quality jobs. »37 Both dimensions will be therefore taken into account in the deployment of the strategy. This ambition will be based on a reflection on the transformations of economic sectors and their impact on employment and training in a changing economy. In order to guarantee the justice of this transition ensured access to energy for all by continuing the fight against fuel poverty and by giving everyone access to healthy and energy-efficient housing technologies allowing active integration into an energy market giving the citizen a central place. One of the pillars of this transition being to ensure that opportunities will be accessible in a way equal and that the resulting benefits will be distributed equitably approach it from a gender perspective integral to the transformation of the economy. What's more substantial co-benefits prospects and improving collaboration in the company38. This integration will be based on a strengthening of the presence of women in STEM sectors39 from the choice of studies. 4.2.

Several other organizations also offer tools for carrying out this type of assessment. Communication campaigns at this level will be continued of behavior 4.3. The central role of local authorities Local authorities also have a central role to play in the development of a society decarbonized. By joining initiatives such as the Covenant of Mayors in Europe and the POLLEC program in Wallonia Action Plan for Sustainable Energy and Climate (SEACP). This constitutes a direction to be taken for achieve decarbonization goals. Governance operates at the scale of the agglomeration or living areas. Sustainability is mainstreamed across all areas of local policy and local authorities transparently examine whether the political decisions taken are coherent with this view. The local authorities unite the actors of their territory around this common project. This vision is co-constructed and shared with the actors of the territory. The municipalities rely for this on highly developed participatory decision-making processes that stimulate and strengthen democracy (e.g. committee steering of the PAEDC Local actors also have a role in mobilizing and encouraging actors in their territory (information and awareness network of actors…). Local authorities thus support the most important initiatives and innovations. carriers in their territories (short supply circuits suburban renewable.

Citizens and behavioral changes are key The entire Long Term Strategy describes a real transformation of society.

Sobriety well-being n taking raw materials in a reasoned and sustainable way is possible. The transition is therefore partly based on the transition from an economy of consumption of goods to an economy of shared services. The role of citizens will be central in the implementation of the transition behaviors which combined with technological solutions greenhouse gas emissions drastically.

The effectiveness of the measures will depend on the strategic approach adopted when implementing them. The social-community marketing approaches offer the greatest potential for fostering responsible behaviors. 4. 5. Land use planning The very structure of the territory influences GHG emissions on a regional scale. Wallonia is characterized by strong suburbanization combined with very little recycling of the built stock. Those structural characteristics of the territory today require the formulation of responses adapted to different environments (urban Territorial Development) been able to demonstrate that appreciable gains in GHG emissions are possible in the field of emissions related to mobility and consumption of residential buildings these cannot be interpreted without a reflection of a territorial nature. 4.4.1. Walloon context and existing tools The Walloon land use planning management tool is the Land Use Planning Code territorial. This came into force on June 1, 2017 and sets four regional targets for territorial development and land use planning: • The fight against urban sprawl and the rational use of territories and resources according to which urbanization must be organized and structured in such a way as to limit the consumption of the soil and valorization of the other resources of the territory in a reasoned way; • Socio-economic development and territorial attractiveness, particularly in relying on the dynamics of metropolises and existing economic networks resources of the territory: communication and fluid and energy transport networks nature conservation sites universities and science parks primary • Qualitative management of the living environment recognizing the landscape as a component essential to the living environment of the inhabitants; • The control of mobility according to which it is advisable to reduce the effects of mobility needs by serving urbanized areas by means of transport other than the car individually at bearable costs but also by rationalizing the transport of goods. in parallel Walloon on July 12, 2018 in order to specify the Walloon strategy by 2050 in terms of land use planning. This plan has identified 6 axes prospective finalities namely: 1. A metropolisation that irrigates Wallonia throughout its creative network; 2. Development of interregional and cross-border links; 41 https://www.seai.ie/publications/Changing-Energy-Behaviour.-What-Works..pdf Many resources are available to support this work.

A welcoming Wallonia Each of these purposes integrates the climate challenge in a variable way depending on the theme. 4.4.2. Guidelines Make structuring communication and transport networks a lever for wealth creation and sustainable development This first guideline aims on the one hand to enhance the communication and transport and on the other hand to strengthen the connection points of these networks. In this context of a new railway backbone and the restoration of certain cross-border links. Those additions must be carried out in parallel with the maintenance and improvement of the existing network). At the level of river transport will strengthen both the north-south links between Antwerp and Paris and the east-west links between the Meuse and the Scheldt. The measures that will make it possible to strengthen the connection points aim to optimize and enhance the port infrastructure while strengthening the rail platforms located on the corridors freight railways. Meeting current and future needs for accessible housing adapted to changes sociodemographic With a view to structuring the Walloon territory around existing buildings building on “well” located land and reusing buildings within these areas. In number terms new housing in the hearts of towns and villages and towards a rate of 75% in 2050 and on the other hand to provide reconstruction of artificial land and 350,000 new homes without artificialization on the horizon of 2050. in parallel achieve these goals improvement of the living environment and meet the health criteria energy imposed on housing in the Walloon regions; to support eco-district projects and facilitate access to property in areas with high land pressure. Include the Walloon economy in the knowledge society and in the local economy (re)form on its territory job-generating processing chains The first course of action is to strengthen the anchoring of the knowledge economy and innovative activities on the territory by making land available for the economy knowledge in the immediate vicinity of universities and maintaining a level of availability land in science parks. Next promotes the local economy while reducing emissions associated with handling and transportation of these resources.

Anticipating economic needs from a perspective of sustainable development and management sparing of the soil Anticipating the needs for spaces intended for economic activity can be achieved in particular by setting up available 200 ha net per year while favoring the redevelopment of wasteland and the operations of « revamping ». In order to meet the needs of businesses in a sustainable and soil-saving way a location of the activities of the tertiary sector according to the other modes of transport and locating shops preferentially in city centres. In terms of numbers new areas of activity must be done on wasteland or already dedicated by tools plans by 2030 and 100% by 2050. Strengthen the attractiveness of urbanized spaces First of all 3,795 ha identified the horizon of 2050.

It is also preferable to exploit the resources of the territory in a reasoned way by refocusing housing in the heart of towns and villages and encouraging the use of materials durable or recyclable. Reduce the vulnerability of the territory and its inhabitants to natural and technological risks and to exposure to anthropogenic nuisances As detailed in Chapter 8 “A resilient Wallonia” climatic conditions are a generally warmer climate (between 1.3°C and 2.8°C in 2050) hot and drier with, in particular, longer and more frequent heat waves more intense rain events in winter a lesser extent.

Finance Public authorities have the following tools: • tax measures and financial incentives (premiums • Emission allowance market • the price signal on use: excise duties The importance of fossil fuels in our economy makes it impossible to ban total and even partial of the latter. Carbon pricing therefore appears as a tool relevant. It encourages economic players to change their behavior and adapt their choices investment in activities compatible with the objective of decarbonizing our economy. In addition to the emission reductions it enables many opportunities: it can thus help to create jobs tax shift to help reduce air pollution. Reorient the choices of investments and tax benefits: Belgium distributes 2 WWF42. The end of fossil fuel subsidies frees up significant resources. This is just one example among many others: • The advantages for company cars amount to almost 3 european commission43. • Imports of energy products amount to 15 billion per year • Between early 2014 and late 2016 KBC and Belfius in the form of loans euros per year44 Increase current public investments: Since 1970 in 2015. One of the lowest levels in the EU. (NB. Euro zone: around 3% of GDP; France and the Netherlands 4% of GDP; Germany As the University of Namur points out compensate for capital depreciation as a percentage of GDP. Belgium's public under-investment therefore leads to a deterioration public assets good long-term operation. We must therefore raise the bar and quickly aim for a level sufficient public investment to stabilize the net stock of public capital as a percentage of GDP. It is mainly public investments and in particular the construction sector that have a beneficial macroeconomic effect. The Bureau du Plan45 recently carried out a simulation of this what would be the impact of a structural increase in public investment in Belgium from 0 du PIB employment would be greatly enhanced.

Mobilization of European funds: It is possible to use European financial instruments both within the framework of its budget and outside of it (EFSI) and various public-private partnerships with industry. EFSI collaboration with the EIBs is now renamed InvestEU, a term under which we will actually find 14 European financial instruments which the Commission hopes will raise 650 billion euros by 2027 (the year marking the end of the multiannual budgetary programming of the EU). Given the fact that Belgium represents just over 3% of European GDP (after the Brexit) private and public. Climate Finance Pact: The Climate Finance Pact is based on the idea that it is necessary and to release 1,000 billion euros per year to finance the energy transition and that this amount can be found by redirecting the existing financial instruments. After all years (increase in the ECB's balance sheet in less than 3 years). It should be possible today to finance the transition through monetary creation and debt. The pact is based in particular on a bank in the climate which would provide Member States with zero-rate loans to finance the transition. The capital of the Climate Bank would be used to guarantee and raise funds funds is typically from 5 to 20. These funds would finance projects with an effect additional multiplier on private banks which is roughly 3. These projects create activity for companies and therefore VAT receipts tax that relates to the state. The financing mechanism is therefore based on several levels. Decline in the import of energy products energy: Imports of energy products amount to 15 billion per year. Today in Wallonia more than 40% of housing was built before 1945 and only 16% after 1990. This necessarily has an impact on the quality of housing and in particular on its performance energy. This obsolescence increases the cost of energy in the household budget. The investigation into the quality of the habitat as other studies show that the fringes of the population having little income occupies the dwellings which are the least well insulated and therefore energy plan.

Identifying the problem According to the Ellen Mac Arthur Foundation46 energy system will only allow us to eliminate 55% of our greenhouse gas emissions tight. The remaining 45% is due to the production of miscellaneous goods. Resource extraction and processing is responsible for 50% of greenhouse gas emissions greenhouse and 1/3 of atmospheric pollutant emissions example resources due to its use). Our economy is based on the quantities produced and consumed; profits and growth are measured by the “Gross Domestic Product”. Our economic growth is based on the consumption of natural resources whose cost intrinsic is not taken into account; resource depletion is not factored into our economy. Our natural resource capital decreases and environmental debt is deferred on future generations. 6.2. The goal In order to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 90 to 100% economic system as well as our view of available resources and quantitative growth du PIB. It is necessary of the goods produced if possible to review the way in which they are produced if necessary and directing production towards goods that minimize energy and energy impacts. environmental. Take the example of agriculture food is produced (for example electrolysis with renewable electricity rather than by reforming natural gas) and finally our diet ! 6.3. Measures 6.3.1.

Reflection and research for 2050 will focus on understanding the “Societal determinants” and “Pressure” aspects and how to direct the economy towards a systemic approach rather than towards quantities produced. 6.3.2. Review the way goods are produced It will not be enough to replace non-renewable energy sources with energy sources renewable. We must get out of the “extract-use-throw away” logic circular primary energy48. Producing goods and services with less and less energy of water and land use will be sought. All research and development of new products must integrate the efficient recycling of product Product design will make maximum use of recycled products and limit the consumption of new resources fossils Any synergy in the use of resources and by-products for production tools will be wanted. 6.3.3. Review the type of goods produced We will limit ourselves to the production of energy goods. Renewable electricity can be used to decarbonize energy use in industry buildings and largely transport. The thermal use of electricity for energy efficient buildings will be optimized by the latest technologies (heat pumps …) and synergies between uses (for example heating and cooling needs). Electricity can replace fossil fuels in industrial processes temperatures higher than what is possible with natural gas, for example. Researches will apply to this use. However green (by electrolysis of renewable electricity (methane reforming with CO2 capture) will be developed as well as the replacement of hydrogen fuels for industrial processes and ammonia production. The case of transport is much more complex.

Similarly should make it possible to identify the potential in exploitable endogenous resources (energy and raw materials whether recycled or not) and implement value chains integrated and competitive. 6.3.5. Regulatory innovations Among the necessary measures circulars and their efficiency is essential. This reflection must integrate all aspects of the cycle from from the design to the processing of materials at the end of the cycle, mainly with regard to the monitoring of hazardous substances (mainly during the pre-treatment phases). Extended product life will be included in regulations for producers. In this context hazardous materials is essential in order to develop recycling channels. Strengthening the framework for industrial and circular symbiosis is essential symbiosis in the products/waste themselves but also at the energy level (whether it is be it the development of RES or the recovery of resource heat). Speaking of fatal CO2 as a resource in order to optimize the short channels of CO2 recovery (the CO2 from decarbonation mineral that seems to have greater potential). In this context of carbon capture in industrial processes must be evaluated in order to avoid a lock-in effect (the CCS must remain the last opportunity). 6.3.6.

L'adaptation au changement climatique : une Wallonie résiliente Climate change is now a global certainty and is becoming increasingly more visible. The successive reports of the IPCC warn and recall the responsibilities humans related to this phenomenon. All parts of the globe are likely to be affected. There is not a field or a sector of activity that will not feel the effects, hence the need for a necessary adaptation. The study of the Walloon Region on adaptation to climate change 49 drew up an exhaustive assessment - characterization themes: agriculture biodiversity and the forest. An extended consultation of experts made it possible to identify the first measures to be implemented in order to adapt the Walloon region to climate change. 7.1. Climate projections The climate projections constructed during the study make it possible to trace the major walloon climate trends then used to assess the impacts of climate change on the territory. A warmer climate There is a clear trend of generalized rise in average temperatures: Between +1 and 2 Maximum temperatures increase faster than minimum temperatures. An increase in the seasonality of precipitation More significant winter precipitation is expected (up to + 20% in 2100 compared to 1961-1990) and more marked regional differences with increased precipitation more important in the Condroz Famenne and Ardennes regions. Conversely dry (with a decrease of up to -25% in 2100 compared to 1961-1990) and also warmer with peaks of up to +6°C in August. About spring and fall but the evolution of precipitation more uncertain. Towards more episodes of intense rain in winter and more frequent summer heat waves In addition to the trends trend towards an increase in the number of annual days of very heavy precipitation (up to +40% increase by 2100). The projected increase is much larger and constant for winter from 2050 summer. On this horizon the increase would even go up to +28 days in 2100. 7.2. The risks The risk of flooding The Walloon territory is particularly sensitive to the risk of flooding which can cause considerable damage to buildings and infrastructure: the 262 municipalities of the Walloon Region have all experienced at least one flood event on their territory either by overflow of watercourses or by runoff. Wallonia's vulnerability to this risk 49 ECORES-TEC 2011-Walloon Region-Study adaptation to climate change Towards a climate-neutral Wallonia 54 Version approved by the GW on 5/12/2019 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:14) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:17) (cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:24)(cid:18)(cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:2)(cid:25)(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:21)(cid:28)(cid:21) (cid:21)(cid:29)(cid:30) (cid:32)(cid:22)(cid:31)(cid:32)(cid:33)est in large part due to l'imperméabilisation croissante des sols overflows indirect effects on which it will be necessary to act in view of the projected increase in risk. The flood risk is expected to increase with climate change due to strong probability of increased precipitation volume and intensity of winter rains. He special attention should therefore be paid to this risk given the damage and costs very important that it is likely to generate. Adaptation deserves to be thought about here over the long term term, particularly in terms of urban planning (limitation of the sprawl soil sealing The risk of soil erosion Soil losses have increased in recent decades in the Walloon region. This finding is explained especially by the increase in the erosivity of the rains which is linked to the increase in the quantity average annual rainfall Some soils such as those of the Limoneuse region (practices intensive farming) have also seen their organic carbon content greatly reduced. From Yield decreases have also been observed due to heavy rains and droughts. Projected increases in the frequency and intensity of winter precipitation will accentuate the phenomenon of water erosion and therefore the very vulnerability of the agricultural sector in particular. Of same reducing plant cover. Row crops and bare soils will be particularly vulnerable. Given the potential seriousness of this risk (eroded soil is often lost soil for ever) necessarily spontaneously. Risks of greater low water levels and increased pollution of waterways Models project a gradual decrease in summer precipitation volumes that combined with a rise in temperature during this same period. This may result in a decrease the quantity of water in the rivers and therefore a risk of greater low water levels. The basin of the Meuse is particularly vulnerable to this development. Analysis of historical series on this basin (AMICE project) shows that the months of August water stress situations over the past century. Projections point to a very sharp decrease significant flow of the Meuse between July and October (less than 50m³/s on average in August september and october external pressures on water resources due to high temperatures (e.g. needs of the sector energy). The increase in these risks could eventually lead to disruptions or even interruptions navigation droughts of 2003). The quality of the water will also be impacted: indeed volumes of water bodies. Risks related to summer heat - The health risk related to (cid:224) summer heat and the (cid:146)amplification of the (cid:146)urban heat island The increase in minimum and maximum temperatures and the increase in the number of wave days summer heat events will have the direct effect of increasing the risk of mortality in summer in particular among people at risk such as the elderly (cardiovascular problems and respiratory) and more particularly in cities. Furthermore be more numerous due to the expected aging of the population indirectly an additional vulnerability.

The increase in heat waves should have direct consequences on Walloon cities by an amplification effect of the urban heat island phenomenon. The intensity of the heat island depends on both seasons and weather conditions but it also depends on the ratio between mineral surfaces and green spaces local geographical conditions. Risks related to the degradation of ecosystems and agrosystems - A risk of declining biodiversity Wallonia is particularly affected by the fragmentation of habitats, which constitutes a major threat to species movement. This fragmentation of habitats is mainly due to the increase in urbanization over the past 20 years important north of the Sambre and Meuse furrow (Godin et al. 2007) but also to agricultural practices and non-adapted forestry (TBE 2010). This fragmentation will pose a serious threat in the translation of species distribution areas expected by climate change greater than the warming will be significant (inability for certain species to migrate in the event of rapid rise in temperature). The environments particularly affected will be the open environments already particularly degraded (example of the limestone lawns in the region of Calestienne whose the total area of habitat has decreased by 87%) and some habitats could even be brought to disappear (peat environments in particular). Improve the connectivity of natural habitats and increasing their surface gives more opportunities for species to perform a shift. However, this adaptation will not happen spontaneously and requires therefore very close support and enhancement of the services provided by the biodiversity to other sectors (biodiversity loss cannot be measured only in terms of intrinsic value but also in terms of services rendered). - A risk of poor adaptation of certain forests and crops to climate change Just like for biodiversity too rapid heating. Beech and spruce in the Walloon forest wind stability). Recent studies have shown that beech is particularly susceptible to the increase in frequency and intensity of summer heat waves and spring drought50 . Some plant crops could also be affected (water-intensive crops such as corn) or temperature sensitive (Raygrass). Adaptations both in the forest sector and on certain crops will have to be considered from a perspective of adaptation to the future climate because they will not happen spontaneously. - A risk of increased sensitivity of agro-systems to invasions and climatic hazards (fires forests in particular) Certain stands and crops could be more sensitive to increased climatic hazards (extreme rain 50 http://biodiversite.wallonie.be/servlet/Repository/changements-climatiques-brochure-recommandations- 2017.pdf?ID=38830&saveFile=true Towards a climate-neutral Wallonia 56 Version approved by the GW on 5/12/2019 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:14) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:17) (cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:24)(cid:18)(cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:2)(cid:25)(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:21)(cid:28)(cid:21) (cid:21)(cid:29)(cid:30) (cid:32)(cid:27)(cid:31)(cid:32)(cid:33)create increased yield variability for farmers and operators. The impacts socio-economic should not be underestimated. Risks to the energy system and links with the issue of mitigation51 Changes to the electricity production system in the short term (moving from a centralized system strongly based on nuclear and fossil energies to a decentralized system ultimately dominated by renewable energies) mainly driven by climate change very large-scale adaptation both in terms of infrastructure (dimensioning and management of transport networks especially electric. These changes will have to be made taking into account the impacts at work and not just the issue of mitigation. Besides the changes network majors energy (including electricity) for cooling and air conditioning purposes during warm months. A maladaptation to this impact is likely to increase the vulnerability of the sector. A l’horizon 2050 climate change to the energy system as it could be at that time. Conversely relevant to take into account these impacts to make the choices of technologies that we will put implemented in the transition of the energy system different forms of renewable energy The risks to the energy system are of several orders global in order to avoid maladaptations and to allow a complete vision of the possible synergies and the necessary trade-offs with the mitigation policy. First of all energy for the production of heat but it could above all lead to an increase in the consumption linked to air conditioning, thus causing consumption peaks. Water availability is an essential element for energy production is also necessary for the production of drinking water. Periods of drought are likely to cause problems of water availability for the cooling of thermal power stations. Cooling water shortages for power plants thermal and nuclear reactors in Wallonia arise planned for the closure of the last reactor at Tihange. Some technologies put forward to fight against global warming CCS can cause problems because it reduces the efficiency of thermal power plants and increases their water needs. Reduced water availability may therefore limit the feasibility of CCS. Security of supply can be affected during heat waves, especially if they coincide with periods of drought and therefore reduced water availability for the cooling of thermal power stations. Heat waves can also impact electricity transmission infrastructure by reducing the transmission capacity of power lines. Weather-dependent renewable energy sources impacted by climate change: wind power solar photovoltaic tends to decrease when the temperature exceeds 25° C yield can nevertheless be compensated by the increase in sunshine during these 51 Sources on the adaptation of the energy system: 1.

Les augmentations of temperatures agricultural production and forest resources which are potentially very much in demand for the supply of biomass for energy production. 7.3. Guiding lines 7.3.1. Strengthen and adapt the management of water and its impacts to the new situation climatic And Wallonia both a lack of water (especially in summer) and occasional excesses (floods). The decrease in resource (potentially accompanied by a degradation of its quality) challenges the development of the territory (power plant cooling) precipitation moist). The threat of excess water is a particular concern for land use planning town planning and construction (e.g. floods S’adapter extreme events; this obviously requires a cross-sectoral vision to manage the conflicts of use taken here aggravate problems elsewhere. We must therefore continue to fight against the risk of flooding and the erosion of agricultural land on the one hand and anticipate the risks linked to the reduction in the availability of the resource while ensuring its quality. 7.3.2. Adapt to the heat in the city and in public spaces If temperatures are expected to rise throughout the year during heat waves disturbing. Rising temperatures in summer have a direct and indirect impact on health and more broadly, comfort and well-being; it is also a source of additional demand energy (cooling technical measures (adaptation of the structures and functioning of the habitat) of changes in lifestyles ; it resonates with the search for a more economical and sustainable vision of territory planning. It encourages us to rethink the city with an urban planning that makes more room great in water and plants Wallonia (Haine furrow located in the furrow and the Brussels Region); The expected increase in summer heat waves calls for interrelated measures aimed not only at strengthening the health management of heat waves and the effects indirect effects of warming but also the improvement of living comfort in buildings and space public as well as the mitigation of the urban heat island effect. In this regard resilience to urban heat islands that require keeping space for vegetation and to maintain unsealed areas. 7.3.3. Strengthen the preservation of biodiversity and improve the resilience of ecosystems and agrosystems If the climate change observed until today is not the main cause of erosion of the biodiversity its impact increases considerably. In addition to the importance and wide variety of services "ecosystemic" that it makes we will be able to tap into the resources to adapt to the changing climate Towards a climate-neutral Wallonia 58 Version approved by the GW on 5/12/2019 (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9) (cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:14) (cid:15)(cid:16)(cid:9)(cid:17)(cid:5)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:17) (cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:3)(cid:24)(cid:18)(cid:21) (cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:2)(cid:25)(cid:21)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:21)(cid:28)(cid:21) (cid:21)(cid:29)(cid:30) (cid:32)(cid:25)(cid:31)(cid:32)(cid:33)areas such as agriculture and forestry or health for example. It is therefore urgent to preserve it to maintain our adaptability. More sustainable forestry closer to the natural functioning of the forest ecosystem promotes natural adaptation and increases resilience to change. In the livestock sector the adaptation of permanent grasslands and fodder crops appears to be more of a priority climate change on heat stress in grasslands and water stress in maize seems important and adaptation cannot be done annually. There is also a strong emphasis (agriculture management of the emergence of exotic and invasive species (supporting and supporting monitoring systems existing A number of sectors (forest the possible increase in climatic hazards such as forest fires due to the increased fragility of certain species or stands, but also to assess the impacts of this type of event on economic activities possibly to adapt the compensation mechanisms accordingly. 7.3.4. Adapting an energy system in transition Generally renewable energy combined with sufficient interconnections and varied flexibility solutions. The risks induced by the impacts of climate change on the energy system can be managed by different types of technical and ad hoc actions or by setting up a mechanism and structural risk impact studies. On the side of technical and specific adaptation measures supply during heat waves with operating limits at higher temperatures in transmission lines strict efficiency standards for air conditioning equipment that will reduce consumption peak sufficient back-up capacities and a transfer to less electricity-generating technologies water consumers such as photovoltaics. Air conditioning demand can also be reduced by improving the design of insulation level buildings windows and thanks to air conditioning technologies that do not consume electricity absorption systems that recover heat. What's more adaptation measures.
