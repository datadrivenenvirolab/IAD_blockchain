Executive Summary The objectives of a long-term ambition of Morocco Morocco has set ambitious climate targets for 2030 as part of its Contribution determined at the national level of Morocco (NDC) updated Morocco wishes to continue to lead the way in climate ambition within the framework of the Paris current and projected particular to the overall goal of climate neutrality. To do this long-term greenhouse gases (GHGs) (LT-LEDS) under Article 4.19 of the Paris Agreement. For this purpose 2050” was launched establishing the main orientations of the Moroccan economy and society between 2020 and 2050 in carbon. This process is part of the reflection that was carried out by the Special Commission on Morocco Development Model in response to the COVID-19 pandemic equitable This first LT-LEDS also aims to stimulate reflections leading to the development of new green value chains ensuring its decarbonization and proactive positioning for export in this sense of its commercial partners and in particular of the "Green Deal" of the European Union and the new African Union Continental Free Trade Area (ZLECAF). The development of the LT-LEDS will allow Morocco beyond the short-term objectives displayed in its NDC potential economic, social and environmental benefits of a decarbonized mode of growth consolidate its international strategic positioning and its competitiveness and attractiveness towards investors and international financial markets. In summary undeniable at national and local level all stakeholders with a view to: • Realize the ambition of "Morocco champion of competitive and green energy" and territories sustainable and resilient aspects of Morocco's new development model by 2035; • Align Morocco's economic and social recovery plan and its associated investments with the low carbon principles • Give a strong political signal and medium and long-term visibility to public investors and private sector and national and international financial institutions; • Ensure synergies between sectoral strategies that have different medium-term objectives and long term; • Strengthen the country's economic competitiveness and the creation of new green and decent jobs through economic growth; • Develop the degree of integration of mitigation and resilience in sector strategies and development programs at national and territorial level present; and • Unleash the potential of a decentralized and participatory energy transition of regions and cities territorial and social.6 Long-Term Low Carbon Strategy In this perspective following: 1. Accelerate the strong development of renewable energies with a view to carbon-free electricity from an indicative target of 80% by 2050; 2. Increase the electrification of uses in industry sectors assess the development potential of green hydrogen to decarbonize industry and freight road; 3. Generalize energy efficiency and efficiency in the use of natural resources in all sectors equipment; 4. Stimulate the circular economy 5. Develop sustainable and resilient agriculture and forest ecosystems and carbon sinks; 6. Implement transport and logistics plans promoting multi-modality and massive investment in the development of new transport infrastructure; and 7. Promote a new generation of sober and “smart” cities system of digital transition technologies in all socio-economic sectors. For it and to follow a systemic approach from different "nexus" crucial in the management of the climate challenge in Morocco: land use planning agriculture LT-LEDS development process With the support of the international alliance NDC Partnership for Climate Action (CAEP) Ministry of the Environment of the Government of Morocco in the process of developing this document for its first LT-LEDS. This document will be supplemented by modeling work on development trajectories and emissions during 2021/22 and by a necessary analysis of sector dynamics to assess the Morocco's ability to converge to climate neutrality during this century. The development of the 2050 Low Carbon Strategy was based on consultations then in group (1) latest work on reducing GHG emissions applied to key sectors of the economy Moroccan. The sectors consulted are those identified in the NDC: energy transport dedicated to key players in local authorities and seawater desalination sectors waste and the national banking and financial sector. The desired objective and strategic orientations for 2050 and to take into account the imperative conditions of successful implementation of LT-LEDS: good governance and “strong leadership” national and territorial development plans territorial The methodological approach followed has capitalized on the significant efforts made by Morocco in major reforms and advances in areas of economic and social development adaptation to climate change and within the framework of the ambitious national program of renewable energies Sustainable Development (SNDD) climate change climatic Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) completed and those in progress (1) Six sector expert workshops took place during September-October 2020 a robust strategy for 2050 development in the energy sectors housing As mentioned before quantification in order to arrive at a long-term GHG emissions trajectory for Morocco the overall objective of the Paris Agreement Workstreams for the quantification of LT-LEDS will include among others: • Analyze the potential of Morocco in renewable energies by exploring a scenario of total decarbonization of the electricity mix by 2050; • Analyze and quantify the share and role of self-production of electricity biomass and marine renewable energies; • Develop scenarios and quantified decarbonization objectives for the major branches and industrial sectors • Develop scenarios and quantified targets for the total decarbonization of the electricity supply the national seawater desalination program • Combine demographic and spatial planning perspectives privileged habitat and transport adapted to different regional conditions; • Assess the impact of agricultural development on GHG emissions the preservation of biodiversity and future climate change; • Assess the potential for reducing losses and waste throughout the supply chain Agriculture • Analyze the scenario and quantified objectives of waste management based on an approach circular economy and its carbon (reduction/ avoidance) and socioeconomic impacts; • Build scenarios to assess the carbon impacts (sinks/emissions) of the sector forest-wood industry by 2050 takes into account the major functionalities of the forest; and • Consider sectoral decarbonization scenarios within the framework of the New Model of Development adopted by Morocco and its socio-economic benefits, particularly in terms of job creation and training and retraining needs. Key success factors To successfully implement the orientations described in this strategy institutional framework for the transition to long-term low-carbon development will have to adapt to future developments in key energy sectors habitat competences of the local authorities established within the framework of the strategic project of the " Advanced regionalization » Municipalities and cities of Morocco. It will require a reconfiguration of design processes systemic structured and regulated integration of long-term low-carbon development in several related policies As such public policies related to climate change and low-carbon development own regional climate ambition citizens awareness and mobilization of private actors and citizens appropriate to the aspirations of the populations and local specificities and climate vulnerabilities intrinsic decision making and consensus building. Furthermore and the opportunities presented by climate finance and sustainable finance national transition to low-carbon and climate-resilient investments.8 Long-Term Low-Carbon Strategy Too recent years in terms of integrating the environmental dimension good governance (ESG) and financial risk management related to climate change and the environment to develop a roadmap for aligning the financial sector with the ambition of the LT-LEDS including long-term expectations and short-term actions. This would include the promotion of the articulation and coordination of regulations and actions between the bank central of credits and similar organisations. It should also be specified that in order to succeed in the energy and societal transition and to materialize effectively all the opportunities it offers around many promising themes industrial integration and innovation are key to avoiding technological dependence but also to create a dynamic development of a green industrial ecosystem in Morocco. Morocco 2050 9 2.  Introduction 2.1. General context Facing the extreme effects of the global climate crisis have committed themselves under the Paris Agreement ambitious measures to keep global temperature rise below 2°C and in fine 1 multilateral process aims to increase and accelerate climate action and ambitions and applies to all countries and all GHG emissions. This is a historic agreement international cooperation in the fight against climate change and shows the way to be continued. As such 26 Furthermore has been established that to limit global warming to 1 far-reaching and unprecedented reach would be needed in all aspects of society. This report states that limiting global warming to 1 rapid and far-reaching in the areas of land use of the building (CO2) from anthropogenic sources are expected to be reduced by approximately 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 means that the remaining emissions should be offset by removing CO2 from the atmosphere through carbon sinks. On the other hand industrial systems of food production to drastically reduce our GHG emissions and preserve our biodiversity and our natural ecosystems. Finally the special report of the IPCC cryosphere” put the ocean and the cryosphere at the heart of the global climate system and highlighted the urgency of resolute action sustainable and unprecedented effects of the ocean and the cryosphere. The report shows the benefits of a ambitious and effective adaptation in the service of sustainable development and exponential cost and risk of late action. The Kingdom of Morocco is recognized as a global leader in terms of adaptation and mitigation of climate change thanks to an ambitious objective (NDC 2030) in view of its development. According to the 2021 Climate Performance Index (CCCP) fourth place out of 58 countries assessed According to the results of the Fourth National Communication (QCN) anthropogenic GHG emissions from Morocco eq in 2018 Emissions of gases other than CO2 accounted for 27,308 of GHG emitted by Morocco. (2) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.10 Long Term Low Carbon Strategy Emissions intensity per unit of GDP fell from 116 in 2018 carbon Evolution of the intensity of GHG emissions per GDP Average annual growth rate = -2 Morocco's performance is driven by its commitment to renewable energy. The country has significantly increased the share of renewable energy over the past ten years developing new skills. With the connection of the largest solar power plant in the world at the time of its commissioning and several new wind farms to the electricity grid is on track to achieve its target of 52% installed renewable energy capacity by 2030. The strong commitment of the Kingdom of Morocco in the transition towards sustainable development materialized through the establishment in 2014 environment and sustainable development during the Council of Ministers June 25, 2017. Based on the four fundamental pillars of sustainable development royal and a societal project and was developed with the aim of accelerating the transition to an economy green and inclusive by 2030. This vision revolves around seven priority development issues which have been broken down into 31 strategic axes and 137 objectives: 1. Consolidate the governance of sustainable development; 2. Successful transition to a green economy; 3. Improve the management and development of natural resources and strengthen the conservation of biodiversity; 4. Accelerate the implementation of the national policy to combat climate change; 5. Pay special attention to sensitive areas (Oasis 6. Promote human development and reduce social and territorial inequalities; and 7. Promote a culture of sustainable development. Since then artwork with ministerial departments and the Administrative Exemplary Pact (PEA) monitoring the implementation of the SNDD. The operationalization of the various action plans of the SNDD has thus strongly contributed to accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its 17 Goals of Sustainable Development The Kingdom of Morocco also organized COP 22 global feat of articulation governments territorial and civil society lead to resilient development The Moroccan presidency has set itself the priority of transforming intentions into commitments through support for the implementation of NDCs. Thereby worldwide “NDC partnership (3)” co-chaired to improve the design of the NDCs of the countries of the South accelerate access to financing and strengthen their institutional and technical capacities in regarding climate change. In addition to the initiatives concerning the key themes of the Agenda for Action (forests commerce international initiatives were announced and institutionalized by Morocco during its presidency of COP 22: •  L’initiative « Triple A » more than 33 countries in Africa funding and capacity building programs; •  L’initiative « Triple S » Morocco resilience and improve the incomes of the populations concerned; •  L’initiative « Water for Africa » of Development (ADB) water; • The “Blue Belt” initiative coastal communities • The international “Sustainable Oases” initiative protection and strengthening of the climate resilience of oasis ecosystems; and •  L’initiative « Arganiers Durable » held in Agadir in December 2019. On the other hand strong climate solidarity with African countries African action in favor of a continental co-emergence including some thirty heads of state. This first summit of Heads of State of the COP 22 major climate commissions to help in the concrete development of projects: commissions of the Congo Basin Morocco has set itself ambitious climate objectives for 2030. As such acquired and consolidate its global climate leadership by having an LT-LEDS as stipulated in the paragraph 19 of article 4 of the Paris Agreement of its economy and society in a "carbon neutral" world. For this purpose coherence of public policies and the alignment of short-term decisions with the objectives of long term. The objective of this process is to arrive at an integrated strategy stakeholders between 2020 and 2050 to achieve a 2050 decarbonization target that is aligned with the Paris Agreement. The other purpose of the LT-LEDS is short-term objectives displayed in the NDCs and dedicate its climate leadership at the by joining international efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The development of LT-LEDS would also offer Morocco several major opportunities to: • Co-construction of a common and shared course of systemic transformation of the development of Morocco and inclusion in a long-term trajectory of a sober economy in carbon; (3) https://ndcpartnership.org/ 12 Long Term Low Carbon Strategy • Acceleration of the alignment of Morocco's development with the requirements of the two agendas united nations while guaranteeing the Kingdom's energy security; • Exploration of the potential repercussions of a decarbonized mode of growth on the plans economic (GDP (green jobs • Improving the economic and social attractiveness of territories developing resilient and low-carbon infrastructure; • Proactive positioning in a rapidly changing international and regional environment and bearer of opportunities to improve the commercial and export position of Morocco: “Green EU deal ”and the possibility of an adjustment at EU borders of the carbon content of imports and continental issues in Africa…; and • Strengthening of the country's international competitiveness foreigners and access to new sources of climate finance and the development of international partnerships. 2.2. Method for developing the LT-LEDS Morocco 2050 With the support of the international alliance NDC Partnership for Climate Action (CAEP) of the Environment of the Government of Morocco in the process of drafting this document at the title of its first LT-LEDS. This document will be supplemented by modeling work on development trajectories and emissions during 2021/22 and by a necessary analysis of sector dynamics to assess the Morocco's ability to converge to carbon neutrality during this century. To lead this strategic project of co-designing the low-carbon development strategy by 2050 participatory and inclusive of all stakeholders: Ministerial Departments public companies civil society associations and research and innovation institutes the efforts made by Morocco socioeconomic against climate change and sustainable development. The objective is to succeed in the appropriation by the stakeholders of the LT-LEDS by 2050 on the basis of an adapted participatory approach and to take into account the imperative conditions of successful implementation of the long-term low-carbon development strategy: good governance and “strong leadership” key role of the private sector and local authorities continuous improvement. For this purpose • A launch conference bringing together the institutions involved in energy aspects of this work; • More than twenty remote interviews with a series of key players in the public and private sector and national experts sectors (energy • Realization of an international benchmark relating to methodological and technological approaches for the development of LT-LEDS; • Six sectoral workshops (Energy with more than 200 participants representing public sector categories national long-term sectoral orientations robust by 2050; Morocco 2050 13 • A wrap-up conference with relevant stakeholders to gather feedback on the 2050 vision; • Organization of thematic workshops dedicated to local authorities waste and finance. 2.3. Morocco's long-term climate ambition Morocco has set ambitious climate targets for 2030 as part of its Contribution determined at the national level of Morocco (NDC). As such path to climate ambition under the Paris Agreement and commensurate with their socio-economic and physical capacities the climate emergency highlighted by the latest IPCC reports climate neutrality. This process is part of the reflection carried out by the Special Commission for the Model of Development of Morocco to the COVID-19 pandemic equitable This first LT-LEDS also aims to stimulate thinking leading to the development new green value chains ensuring its decarbonization and proactive positioning for export in this sense of its commercial partners and in particular of the "Green Deal" of the European Union and the African Union Continental Free Trade Area (ZLECAF). In this perspective following: 1. Accelerate the strong development of renewable energies with a view to carbon-free electricity from an indicative target of 80% by 2050; 2. Increase the electrification of uses in industry sectors assess the development potential of green hydrogen to decarbonize industry and freight road; 3. Generalize energy efficiency and efficiency in the use of natural resources in all sectors equipment; 4. Stimulate the circular economy and the reduction and recovery of waste; 5. Develop sustainable and resilient agriculture and forest ecosystems and carbon sinks; 6. Implement transport and logistics plans promoting multi-modality and investment integrating new transport infrastructures; and 7. Promote a new generation of sober and “smart” cities including through integration system of digital transition technologies in all socio-economic sectors. Eventually • Contribute to low-carbon growth transition costs; • Improve the climate resilience capacity of the development model and the associated costs Management ; • Strengthen the capacity to mobilize funding for measures taken in the area of climate change; • Increase the country's competitiveness in the face of a transition to inclusive and sober green growth national and global carbon emissions; and • Strengthen dialogue 3. Local context and framing of the Vision 3.1. Moroccan political and socio-economic framework During the last two decades their rhythm and their nature demographic transition and urbanization have accelerated per capita of the population has increased significantly interior gradually opened up. The country has consolidated its position as an attractive regional destination for foreign direct investment and an indisputable pole of security and stability recognized by the entire international community. This development is the result of advances notables an intense socio-economic catch-up and a policy of openness and sustainable transformation. The Kingdom Commitment strengthened by the adoption of a new Constitution healthy environment and sustainable development for all citizens recognizes the new generation of human rights and promotes dialogue between the living forces of the Nation and participatory democracy. The new Constitution establishes the foundations of the great State reform represented by advanced regionalization. During this period compared to 3% during the 1990s) and per capita income has almost doubled thanks to ambitious sectoral policies implemented motorway and airport network, etc.) and the policy of supporting the purchasing power of citizens. These efforts have led to a reduction in the poverty rate and the virtual generalization of education. primary access to drinking water and electricity and the opening up of more than three million inhabitants in rural environment. This has accelerated its economic, social and environmental development. well-being for citizens macroeconomic Capitalizing on its strengths and achievements of dynamic development that ensures strong growth chances and solidarity centered on the citizen. Despite these advances l’inclusion industries that have enabled the growth of a limited number of sectors (automotive phosphates…) run out of steam and productivity growth remains limited. The growth of the Moroccan economy is still dependent on an agriculture that is vulnerable to effects of climate change. The Moroccan economy is also marked by a tertiarization the services developed representing 51 for the non-refining processing industry. These services are mostly low value added. The accumulation of physical capital as an engine of growth is weighed down by a low return investment (ICOR (4) high around 8 points) and net exports contribute little to the GDP growth Department of Studies and Financial Forecasts (DEPF) September 2019 economy and development: Strategies for the structural diversification of the economy (4) Incremental Capital Output Ratio.Maroc 2050 15 Moroccan” economic complexity The competitiveness of the national company remains insufficient. Most companies operate in sectors with low added value the share of industry and the digital economy does not exceed 10% of total companies. In outraged This slowdown in growth is burdened on the one hand by a strong energy dependence on the Morocco abroad from 91 which currently cover 20% of electrical energy needs energy of 76 impact on the trade balance deficit and the competitiveness of the company. On the other hand water currently estimated at around 650 m3/inhabitant/year water demand expressed for the different categories of use by 2050 should reach 18 irrigation. Gaps between water supply and demand are estimated at around 4 billion m3 and will increase with the expected effects of climate change. The fragility of the model is thus aggravated by climate-related issues which raise questions of the preservation of non-substitutable resources climate change (water stress the development of renewable and substitutable resources. In addition to endogenous weaknesses economic and technological medium and long-term impact on the national economy and society. These long transitions term provide new opportunities to increase growth and economic resilience and social address through new public policies based on technological breakthroughs financial and change of approach in our conception of a common national vision and shared long-term development model. Thereby durable decent To address these weaknesses and achieve the desired ambition as part of an integrated approach assumed and likely to create support the Special Commission for the New Development Model (CSMD) a precise and objective diagnosis of the current situation structural to be corrected tracer Development which should allow Morocco to reach the rank of advanced countries. Furthermore by the COVID-19 pandemic by HM King Mohammed VI: 1. The first is of a social nature: the need to strengthen social safety nets at an strong enough for all Moroccans to have health insurance a pension plan and a family allowance depending on the number of children and the size of each family; 2. The second axis relates to the economic revival which is essential because of the disturbances which have affected a number of sectors such as tourism and air transport. As such mobilized to revive the economy; and (5) http://depf.finances.gov.ma/etudes-et-publications/16 Long-Term Low Carbon Strategy 3. The third priority of the Kingdom concerns the exemplarity of the State through the reform of the public sector and the structural financial deficit of public establishments and enterprises (EEP). The objective is to achieve better financial efficiency within the latter. In the same wake Industrial Recovery Plan 2021-2023 confirm the Kingdom's industrial position and conquer new markets and territories industrialists using public procurement as a catalyst. The second project concerns improving Morocco's competitiveness become the most competitive global base for Europe. At last aims to position the Kingdom as a low-carbon and circular industrial base and to put part of the renewable energies of the Kingdom in the service of an industrial anchorage. The development context thus presented highlights the potential opportunities and Challenges of aligning Morocco's future development model with the two global agendas of the United Nations to which Morocco subscribes Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. As such constitutes an appropriate approach to appropriately articulate the efforts of all the stakeholders with a view to: • Accelerate the implementation of the National Sustainable Development Strategy and the achievement of ODD of the Agenda 2030 other way of development; • Align Morocco's economic and social recovery plan and its associated investments with the low carbon principles • Give a strong political signal and medium and long-term visibility to public investors and private sector and national and international financial institutions; • Ensure synergies between sectoral strategies that have different medium-term objectives term and long term; • Strengthen the country's economic competitiveness and the creation of new green and decent jobs through economic growth; • Develop the degree of integration of mitigation and resilience in sector strategies and development programs at national and territorial level present; • Unleash the potential of a decentralized and participatory energy transition of regions and cities territorial and social; • Specify the commitments of local authorities and the breakdown of mitigation objectives and resilience at territorial and local level cities and metropolises; and • Identify the impacts on the strategy for mobilizing public and private funding with a view to securing the necessary resources. Furthermore towards the relocation of global value chains at the regional level and close to the basins consumption and the emergence of new tariff barriers induced by the integration of climate requirements in free trade agreements european deal to attract new foreign direct investment exports but also challenges to overcome. In effect benchmark for national products with 65% of Moroccan exports. This reinforces the importance and relevance of developing a Low Carbon Development Strategy in the Long Term with a view to ensuring a systemic approach to decarbonizing our economy and its export offer and at the same time ensure strong local industrial integration through the creation of new green industrial ecosystems range of the industrial ecosystem and positioning of Morocco as a “Best Value Country”. Morocco 2050 17 The challenge is to adapt these sectors to changes in international markets and to the needs of major clients and international contractors. 3.2. New development model for Morocco by 2035 Ambition of the Morocco of tomorrow by 2035 The Special Commission on the Development Model (CSMD) presented on May 25, 2021 general report of the New Development Model of Morocco (NMD) to His Majesty the King Mohammad VI. Thereby a multidimensional approach and operated a rigorous framework for its work. She has in particular explored the new issues and changes brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic strategic areas such as health industrial and tourist development. Based on the strengths and millennial history of the Kingdom (NMD) of Morocco proposes as a common ambition that of a prosperous Morocco skills This ambition for Morocco is defined as follows: “In 2035 where everyone is fully capable of taking charge of their future and unleashing their potential live in dignity in an open society value significant progress nationally takes care of the great challenges that challenge the world. » Morocco's NMD supports its ambition with its determination to take up five bold bets for the future who most attractive in the region and on the continent. The five bets for the future are: i) Become a digital nation mobilized; ii) Become a regional higher education hub iii) Become the regional champion of low carbon energy; iv) Acquiring Financial Pole status Regional reference; v) Make Made in Morocco a marker of quality durability transformational and built on the competitive advantages of the Kingdom and on its potential areas of the future carry within them a convergence of interests between the Kingdom and its main 18 Long-Term Low Carbon Strategy external partners and can thus contribute to strengthening cooperation and partnerships cross-functional support for multiple challenges underlying the New Development Model. It is proposed that this ambition be translated into targeted development goals quite within reach top of the various world rankings of Nations by 2035 devote more of his vocation as a model in his region and well beyond. Among these objectives doubling of gross domestic product per capita by 2035 base at the end of the primary cycle by more than 90% of pupils inhabitants to reach WHO standards the extension of the participation rate of women to 45% of citizens towards the administration and public services by more than 80% renewables in total energy consumption at 40% energy-intensive industries to 0 purified water up to 15% of total water consumption. To achieve its ambition and fundamental objectives transformation strategies promoted by the NMD repository. First of all added and low productivity competitive economy must generate more growth and quality jobs to intensify the creation of value and ensure the integration of the active population Human capital must be strengthened to give all citizens the ability to take charge their future and its integration into the knowledge and immaterial economy axis requires essential reforms and higher and vocational education. The third axis of transformation seeks the participation of all populations participation and equal access to economic opportunities through openness and acceptance of the diversity of Moroccan society. Social Norms discrimination and lack of capacities and skills place for a dynamic of inclusion through growth strengthening of social ties. The territories centrally designed policies of carrying public policies. This will be the decisive lever to guarantee equitable access to public services tributaries of national identity and guaranteeing the dignity of all Moroccans and in all walks of life closer to needs and potential. To accelerate change its skills and methods and to make maximum use of the digital lever in view of its rapid transformational potential. Paris of “Morocco champion of competitive and green energy” The ambition of Morocco's NMD is to make energy a lever of attractiveness and development with a view to triggering a real competitiveness shock low-carbon production methods. Such an approach will energy of the country (in volumes and in prices) and to establish it as a world player in sustainability and in the field of renewable energies power generation equipment. Taking into account the elements of the diagnosis and the proposed ambition have been identified with a view to accelerating Morocco’s energy transition process and enable it to best meet its needs in terms of economic competitiveness and sustainability:Morocco 2050 19 1. Establish a new institutional architecture around a strong regulator credible for the entire sector: this new organization must accompany the increase decentralized generation and new entrants and must regulate the role of the actors traditional in a logic of liberalization and efficiency. Such liberalization must be accompanied by incentives and sanctions by a strong regulator to fully activate the role of the regulator in the critical phases of the value chain of energy (production / supply – transport – distribution / marketing). At last regionalization of distribution is an opportunity to modify the incentives of distribution companies distribution by gradually lifting the monopoly on medium voltage and authorizing the generation development. 2. Implement a transparent pricing policy clear separation of the role of the players: the objectives of the energy pricing policy must be clearly stated and must promote transparency (access to information from the regulator) dynamism (by accompanying market changes) the most competitive prices possible). To support such a policy complete the reforms aimed at deepening the electricity and gas market competes with sources of generation (electricity) and sources of supply (gas) and clearly unbundling public service activities (transmission and distribution) and those of the merchant (production and marketing). The separation of production roles distribution could also be accompanied by a strengthening of actors at the level regional securing the electricity supply. 3. Restructure ONEE to enable it to carry out its strategic function of modernizing the network of electricity transmission and support for the reform of the sector: the restructuring and the establishment of ONEE's strategic and financial autonomy is essential for more transparency on the real cost of energy real cost for the State producers on a fair and comparable benchmark. 4. D evelop decentralized production competitive in the territories: decentralized production will make it possible to reinforce the reliability resilience forms of production using technologies that optimize yields capitalizing on existing infrastructure. The installation of smart grids or installations self-production of renewable energy sources in industry residential will make it possible to control the energy consumption of the self-producer and to inject part of the surplus in a regulated and adaptable market. A global vision of energy efficiency must be articulated around precise objectives accompanied by monitoring and evaluation mechanisms ensuring the achievement of these same objectives. Voluntary adoption of technologies such as smart grids and the IoT will go in the direction of production and smart consumption. Energy efficiency also involves the integration of energy and eco-climate considerations in land use planning territory. The implementation of any public policy and sectoral strategy must respond to the imperatives of the energy transition the most advanced legislation in energy-intensive areas such as transport industry. 5. Uncap access to natural gas for industry and for the development of the country: Morocco should use natural gas for the production of electricity in addition to the units of production from solar or wind energy to generate heat. The development of the national gas market requires an explicit choice in favor of management by price and not by volume cap a separation between transmission and distribution activities and the establishment of a company single buyer price competition.20 Long Term Low Carbon Strategy 6. Establish Morocco as a regional platform in energy exchanges local content: it is crucial to increase the exchange capacity of the interconnections with Europe and strengthen Morocco's position as the main electricity exchange point between Africa and southern Europe. A connection of the Moroccan network to the countries of West Africa would be great strategic significance and would place development and prosperity geopolitical discussions in the region area of renewable energy development. The positioning of Morocco as a hub energy should be accompanied by genuine territorialized industrial integration. Thereby is crucial to ensure technological appropriation and to allow the emergence of expertise and local content (storage techniques Long-term replacement of fossil fuels and the rise of carbon-free electricity. Synthetic ammonia also represents an equally promising opportunity due to the alleviation that the local production of green ammonia could induce on the country's dependence for the production of phosphorus-based fertilizers. This means investing more in research and development and innovation activities and to deploy pilot projects on the base of partnerships with experienced players based on the R&D base developed by the OCP. Marine renewables also have real decarbonization potential of the economy, thus taking advantage of its seafront. Resilient and sustainable territories The NMD is the bearer of a new vision on the role of the territories public policies with the State and place of their successful implementation. This vision consecrates central place of territories as a source of creation of material and immaterial wealth the emergence of participatory democracy and the anchoring of the principles of the sustainability of resources and their resilience to the effects of climate change. The Covid-19 crisis has strongly revealed territorial inequalities in terms of access to services grassroots public and wealth creation. It also revealed the need to address these challenges through renewed and specific approaches. From this statement the imperative to boost the capacity of territories and strengthen their resilience in a sustainable way. This approach requires rethinking the operating mechanisms at the territorial level Commission advocates a renewal of territorial governance State-Region complementarity the development of space and living spaces and the preservation of natural resources. To promote the emergence of prosperous territories the following five strategic choices: • Bring about a prosperous and dynamic “Morocco of the Regions”; • Ensure an innovative reorganization of the territorial levels and promote their coordination; • Promote integrated territorial development connectivity and mobility; • Preserve natural resources and strengthen the resilience of territories to climate change; • Preserve scarce water resources for us In this perspective, it is necessary: i. accelerate decentralization and deconcentration with effective transfers of powers and ensure that the Regions fully fulfill their functions and prerogatives; ii. to revisit the administrative organization of the territories and mobilize their synergies to improve the quality of service to citizens; Morocco 2050 21 iii. simplify the governance of urban development and adopt a housing policy particularly for the social housing component socio-economic inclusion and a better living environment proximity quality digital connectivity; iv. strengthen the protection of natural resources and biodiversity; v. and to reform the water sector in favor of uses that reflect the scarcity of this resource. 3.3. State of play of climate action in Morocco The Kingdom of Morocco is part of the international effort to operationalize the Agreement of Paris and the acceleration of the Climate Action Agenda while capitalizing on the momentum and mobilization of key actors different levels. Morocco submitted GHG emissions by 2030 actions covering seven (07) economic sectors. The updated NDC in numbers The reduction of 45 of 61 Shares with an envelope of 38 Non-conditional objectives Conditional objectives 18 Overall rate and not Overall rate and conditional emission reduction conditional emission reduction baseline GHG emissions in 2030. GHG emissions. 34 27 Actions.  Actions. 17 USD billion. USD.22 billion Long Term Low Carbon Strategy Morocco's 2030 NDC is one of the few to be deemed compatible with the global objective to limit the increase in global temperature to 1.5°C by the independent organization Climate Action Tracker (6). Morocco's NDC is characterized by its transparency by clearly identifying a list of projects achievement of the national goal. The implementation of the projects listed in Morocco's NDC should be based on an innovative and optimal financial arrangement between the State international climate finance instruments the effective use of the opportunities offered by the new legislative framework for Public Partnerships Private (PPP). in addition coordination and development framework for a medium- and long-term climate policy to respond proactively and ambitiously to the challenges posed by change climate and the Moroccan context. The PCN is based on the following five pillars: • establish stronger climate governance; • Building resilience to climate risks • Accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy; • Include the territories in the climate dynamics; • Strengthen human capacities To mitigate these climate vulnerabilities National Strategy for Adaptation (PNSA) according to a highly concerted approach. He assigned himself three major objectives: to adequately and urgently strengthen the resilience of the population and territories; increase national high-level political support for adaptation; mobilize support technical and financial support at the international level for adaptation. This process is structured according to five main axes: • Governance of the PNSA; • Climate knowledge and information; • Evaluation • Resilience of vulnerable resources and ecosystems; and • Resilience of productive sectors. Too territorial Morocco aims to mobilize public or private financing of domestic and international origin And this adaptation of NDC Morocco. The estimated cost to implement adaptation component programs Morocco updated fishing and aquaculture vulnerable The Councils of the Regions of Morocco will have implementation of projects included in the NDC of Morocco and on the other hand plans for adaptation and resilience to changes based on the identification of their vulnerabilities climatic. Already integrate several adaptation and climate resilience infrastructure projects into their Regional Development. The other actors of territorial development of Morocco and in particular the metropolises intermediaries and the rural world are also concerned by the integration of the climate in their municipal action plans and urban center development plans investments in infrastructure related to water resource management areas energy and adaptation and resilience. (6) https://climateactiontracker.org/ Morocco 2050 23 This will also require an additional effort on the part of the territorial administration in in terms of financial engineering and technical assembly of projects in order to be able to mobilize funding needed offered by the PPP in particular those with the Green Climate Fund. To support and guarantee the successful implementation of its strategies and objectives has put in place new institutional arrangements for governance and capacity building technical and financial capacities making its ambitions feasible and realistic • The institutionalization of the national commission for sustainable development of Government with two committees: “Committee for monitoring and steering the implementation of the national strategy for sustainable development” and the “committee for monitoring and supporting sustainable development goals”; • The institutionalization of the National Commission on Climate Change and Diversity Biological. This commission is attached to the government authority responsible for the environment and constitutes a consultation and coordination body to ensure the monitoring of the implementation of the commitments provided for in international conventions and their protocols relating to climate change and biological diversity two sub-commissions: the “Biological Diversity” sub-commission and a sub-commission "Climatic changes" ; • Implementation of the institutional scheme of the National GHG Inventory System (SNIGES). the agreed institutional scheme includes a National Inventory Commission (CNI) National Inventory (UNI) Inventorists and Focal Points. Besides of national climate action is being finalized to implement all of the MRV criteria and transparency framework reports; • The legal subjection of public policies sectoral or regional to the strategic environmental and climate assessment stipulated in the framework of the new law n° 49.17 relating to environmental assessment • Establishment of a roadmap for the alignment of the Moroccan financial and banking sector with the sustainable development. This roadmap revolves around 5 major axes: 1) the extension of risk-based governance to socio-environmental risks sustainable financial instruments and products capacity building in the field of sustainable finance and 5) transparency and market discipline; • Creation in 2016 of the Center of Competence in Climate Change (4C Morocco) platform for building the skills of actors from different sectors. He is organized into 4 colleges (public sector college and local authorities economic and the dissemination of skills in terms of climate change open to its environment national and African; • Launch of a reflection on a draft law on climate change in Morocco with a view to provide a legal and binding basis for climate ambition and commitments international; and • Publication by Bank Al-Maghrib (Central Bank) of the national regulatory directive No. 5/W/2021 relating to the identification device financial risks related to climate change and the environment by financial institutions credit. This directive constitutes a methodological reference framework that deals with the risks physical climate change and also takes into account credit institutions and similar organisations.24 Long-Term Low Carbon Strategy 4. Sector Strategies 4.1. Energy sector 4.1.1. State of play CO2-energy emissions and the mix of the electricity sector in Morocco In Morocco most of the energy transformation sector. The electricity sector alone represents 40% of Morocco's "energy" CO2 emissions conventional thermal power plants (coal 2018. The last decade has been marked by the rise of natural gas and renewables as well as a revival of coal since 2013. Morocco CO2 emissions (combustion Source : Enerdata Emissions from the electricity sector are found in the form of indirect emissions in the sectors where the final consumption of electricity takes place constitutes an essential lever for the decarbonization of other sectors of the Moroccan economy: industry Significant GHG emissions come from the direct use of fossil fuels or other emission sources: Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPUP) and Land Use Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). State of play and reflections on the decarbonization of the sector The international environment appears very promising for Morocco, which has exceptional assets such as its renewable energy potential and a proactive strategy that has already resulted in the success of major projects structuring factors in wind and solar power. The Morocco ambitious and conceivable and even already under consideration. The current target calls for 52% renewable energy in the total installed capacity by 2030. It should be noted that the objectives of Morocco's NDC are in being revised and provide for an enhancement of Morocco's ambitions in this area. The transition to renewables is a project that was initiated and supported at the highest level of the State Moroccan. The strategic framework in the electricity sector is broadly in place and is consistent with very clearly on a decarbonization trajectory based on a ramp-up progressive share of renewable energies. All the stakeholders consulted agree to consider an advanced decarbonization of the electricity sector as the desired long-term objective. The players in the sector are in in addition to very demanding ambitious but realistic quantified objectives for 2040 and 2050 in order to guide their expectations and prepare their own strategies and action plans in a sector where the development of projects takes several years and where the investment horizon may exceed one or two decades or more. Many strategic studies and roadmaps are being prepared: Diagram Production Director of ONEE in 2040 roadmap for the exploitation of marine energies self-production of electrical energy National Energy Efficiency 2030 2050 for the electricity sector and other energy transformation activities. 4.1.2. Sector vision statement A largely carbon-free energy supply mix for 2050 The rapid and continuous decline in the cost of renewable energies and storage validates the orientation taken by Morocco and authorizes the adoption of very ambitious decarbonization strategies focused on the production of green electricity and hydrogen. A share of renewable energies of 70% by 2040 and 80% to 2050 in the electricity mix both in energy and in capacity is possible with the technologies and current cost outlook. Going beyond these rates could lead to significant additional costs, but the situation may change with the technological progress expected in the decades to come. At 2050 the use of conventional thermal power plants (coal reduction and smart grid technologies would become central in managing intermittency and balancing the system. Green hydrogen produced by electrolysis from renewable electricity and its derivatives (ammonia help decarbonize energy sectors and uses that cannot be directly electrified. They are mainly found in heavy transport (ships distance) and certain industrial applications (industrial heat at very high temperatures).26 Long-Term Low-Carbon Strategy A low-carbon energy mix is an essential lever for the decarbonisation of other sectors and source of industrial and commercial opportunities The increase in the share of renewable electricity and the increased electrification of end uses are the main levers for decarbonizing the energy mixes of industrial sectors of the building must not, however, be done to the detriment of Morocco's competitiveness. The transition to a mix carbon-free energy must finally be thought out in such a way as to create economic and important social issues, particularly in terms of employment. On this last point low and medium voltage self-production in the production of electricity would be complementary to the approach based on large industrial solar and wind projects and would make it possible to consolidate the use of renewables and generate skilled local jobs. Morocco's potential in renewable energies and its geographic proximity to European and African markets also make it possible to envisage in the long term of its derivative products. A deeply carbon-free energy mix would thus lead to avoided imports (petroleum products country but also to an improvement in its security of supply. Innovation and R&D would enable Morocco to pursue its industrial development and better integrate into international markets An innovation strategy progressive and adapted industrial sector can enable Morocco to reduce its technological dependence to move upmarket and create a dynamic of industrial development in the sector of energy and associated services and equipment. What's more international markets for carbon-intensive goods is challenged by the transition towards low carbon (and the introduction of carbon taxes at the borders) energy deeply decarbonized by Morocco is a tool to strengthen its competitiveness and its attractiveness for foreign investors. The private sector and the territories play a decisive role in the transformation of the sector energy The transition of the energy sector should rely primarily on the private sector, which alone has the capacity to make the necessary investments for the transformation of the energy system. The State Moroccan can play its role of "conductor" by defining the general orientations and by initiating or facilitating the implementation of strategies defined jointly with all parties stakeholders. Territories also have an essential role to play in the optimization and integration of utility networks (energy – water – waste – mobility – building) companies and the creation of favorable conditions for the development of renewable energies at local level. A dense network of Moroccan experts in the fields of renewable energies smart grids is essential to support companies and in particular small and medium-sized ones businesses (SMEs) and very small businesses (VSEs) in their energy transition. 4.1.3. Questions and queries Uncertainties related to the international environment The success of Morocco's strategy rests in part on developments taking place in internationally, such as the integration and development of the electricity and hydrogen markets carbon taxes at borders For example and global hydrogen markets. The international is therefore a source of uncertainties and risks but also a source of opportunities thanks to the availability of international funding transfers of technology and know-how which must be mobilized and maximized as much as possible thanks to a proactive strategy from Morocco Consideration of climate and environmental risks The energy sector, like many sectors, is partly vulnerable to rise in climate and environmental risks. For example Morocco is deteriorating from year to year due to climate change. It is therefore crucial to reflect on the flexibility and adaptability of the system in the face of these risks in-depth assessment of the impact of climate change on both infrastructure and the maximum renewable energy potential taking into account the different development options Moroccan territory and competition between uses (eg biomass). The need for integrated and decentralized multisectoral governance The success of Morocco's energy transition goes beyond the energy sector alone and requires the implementation of a highly integrated multi-sectoral approach at different geographical levels including all stakeholders: ministries and government agencies private and public civil society. The decentralization of decisions is essential because the majority of actions to be entrepreneurship takes place at a local level. In this respect, it would be useful to define the long-term strategy in the form of concrete projects to be carried out both for centralized production and for self-production. A significant uncertainty arises from the methodology for defining and implementing the 2050 strategy because it must integrate the collective capacity to implement the energy transition and identify possible barriers and obstacles. For example energy efficiency remains to be demonstrated; this therefore implies carrying out many milestones and meetings at national and local levels. Set up a system for monitoring objectives and results The importance of the transition ambition implies the establishment of technology watch systems highly responsive monitoring-evaluation and MRV allowing frequent readjustment of measures and shares. Technical and legal tools for incentives/sanctions will have to be put in place. The Morocco's capacity in terms of MRV will need to be strengthened. It is also necessary to carry out a work of raising awareness, particularly aimed at young people, and setting up a strategy from the outset to neutralization of the negative social and environmental impacts of the transition to ensure its sustainability by supporting and compensating the "losers" of the transition. 4.1.4. From sectoral vision to strategy: proposal for work on energy • Confirm the electricity mix scenarios in terms of energy and power at 2040 and 2050 (respectively 70% and 80%) and explore a scenario of total decarbonization of the electricity mix by 2050. This work requires a detailed analysis of Morocco's potential in renewable energies and its sensitivity to climatic hazards in order to assess their ability to cover domestic electricity demand hydrogen or other (biogas export; • Develop scenarios for the energy transformation sector excluding electricity: refining (petroleum products and biofuels) heating and cooling networks. This analysis must be conducted on the basis of a detailed study of energy demand and technical and economic options for decarbonizing the different uses in industry • Analyze and quantify the share and role of self-production of electricity by voltage level (low average • Establish a technological and R&D roadmap for the energy sector adapted to the Morocco ; and • Identify the main indicators for monitoring and evaluating the decarbonization of the energy sector and set up an adequate MRV information system.28 Long-Term Low Carbon Strategy 4.2. Industry sector 4.2.1. State of play GHG emissions from industry in Morocco In Morocco from the combustion of fossil fuels and 50% of indirect emissions mainly related to uses of electricity. The deep decarbonization of industry therefore largely involves the of the electricity sector. To these "energy" emissions PIUP which represent half of the total GHG emissions of Moroccan industry. These last have been more or less stable since 2010 and tend to increase less rapidly than those of sectors such as building or transport. Direct and indirect CO2 emissions from Morocco GHG emissions from industry (Energy and Processes (combustion Source : Enerdata Among the industrial sectors with high GHG emissions, we can mention cements and phosphates which alone represent more than three-quarters of the total emissions of Moroccan industry. the rest comes from more diffuse sources (construction capital goods LPG (IGCE) (7) and Light Energy Consuming Industries (ILCE) (8). IGCEs are very GHG emitters and the cost of energy is a key factor in their competitiveness. For ILCEs whose processes are less GHG intensive determining their cost competitiveness. (7) Sugar (8) Agri-food industries other miscellaneous industries (source: AMEE).Morocco 2050 29 State of play and reflections on the decarbonization of industry in Morocco The Ministry of Industry has already launched a strategic reflection on the decarbonization of the industry sector as part of the SNDD (Axis 2: Green economy). The main objectives stated at this stage are as follows: (i) improvement of the competitiveness of manufacturers moroccans industrial integration rate and (iv) identification and development of new industrial sectors green. Work to promote sustainable development in many industrial ecosystems is also in progress. Furthermore and digital set up transition to a green economy and ensure its implementation. This decree also organizes the transfer of State supervision of the Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency (AMEE) to this same ministry. The AMEE sees its prerogatives extended to the green economy encompassing energy therefore constitutes an important mission for the AMEE. The Ministry of Energy, Mines and the Environment has planned for its part the transformation of the SIE into a super service company (ESCO) serving the public sector. In this direction energy has been strengthened the mandatory energy audit and the creation of audit bodies; to the definition of the specifications charges from energy service companies (ESCO); and performance monitoring energy requirements of appliances and equipment on import and on the national market. Regarding the standardization component photovoltaic and solar thermal installations have been made compulsory development of the PV quality infrastructure has been launched. Beyond this strategic reflection being prepared which specify or shed light on certain aspects of the energy transition of industry: SNDD route Power-to-X waste recovery energy efficiency the Office for Vocational Training and Work Promotion (OFPPT) Of the industry green growth” which aims to support industrial VSMEs development of carbon-free processes and products and to support the emergence of new sectors competitive green industries and the reduction of industrial pollution. A second program is being finalized to generalize renewable energies in industrial areas. He does not exist sector of Moroccan industry considered as a whole by 2050. We can note however, some sectors and companies (e.g. OCP targets for reducing their GHG emissions. Specifically must pursue GHG reduction targets defined by their parent company at the global level and therefore benefit thereby from transfers of technology and know-how. 4.2.2. Sector vision statement Advanced decarbonization of Moroccan industry is an ambitious project but an objective realistic and shared The advanced decarbonization of the electricity sector and the large-scale deployment of energies renewables provide a favorable environment for the decarbonisation of industrial activities. A deep decarbonization of the electricity mix by 2040 and 2050 up to 70% or 80% respectively is an essential and entirely possible first step. Nevertheless (9) Decree No. 2-19-1085 relating to the powers of the Minister of Industry industrial emissions requires going beyond the greening of the electricity mix and involves use a range of measures including energy efficiency increased electrification of uses source industrial (automation and digitization of processes « machine to machine » and economically viable additional advances or even technological breakthroughs. The decarbonization project of Moroccan industry is today carried by the AMEE. An ambitious low-carbon transition is a source of industrial opportunities and job creation Morocco's successful experiences in the renewable energy sector open up opportunities interesting development opportunities for the “renewable energy” industrial ecosystem and beyond the whole Moroccan industry both for the national market and the export markets on the African continent. The growth of the “clean” energy equipment and services industry (renewable energies gradual increase in local content and a move upmarket for Moroccan companies driven by a domestic demand and public order. A largely carbon-free energy system could also facilitate the establishment of foreign companies looking for a “clean” energy mix and would transform the introduction of carbon taxes at the borders by client countries of the Morocco as a competitive advantage. At last energy efficiency gains makes it possible to consider the possibility of controlling the energy bill for Moroccan industry. Finally, the transition must be organized in such a way as to benefit SMEs and VSEs and to encourage the transfer of informal enterprises to the formal sector. Boosting industrial innovation and introducing green taxation to make the energy transition a success Of the industry The transformation of the industry requires the implementation of an innovation and R&D strategy aimed at introducing clean technologies and good practices at all levels of the process industrial production: raw material This R&D policy must be adapted to the Moroccan context and focused on the pre- industrialization and be as close as possible to the field and the concerns of companies. AT like the German model SMEs or start-ups. The greening of public procurement can play a crucial and exemplary role in supporting the industry by promoting R&D and creating Moroccan demand sustainable (especially for SMEs). The introduction of a tax system favorable to the transition based on the introduction of taxation and incentive tools (eco-taxes targeted…) would allow manufacturers to direct their investments and Moroccan consumers adjust their preferences and their willingness to pay for low-carbon products. An integrated multi-sectoral approach which gives an important place to supporting the businesses and staff training The decarbonization of industry requires identifying and leveraging all the synergies and “material” and “energy” flows within the various industrial ecosystems local within green industrial zones or “circular ecoparks”. This involves analysis and very fine mapping of the interconnections between sectors and between companies to take account of their technical specifications jobs and GHG reduction. Companies and initiators of innovative projects must be accompanied by technical assistance and advice appropriate funding mechanisms. Staff should be trained and made aware of work on energy efficiency carbon balances energy” could be appointed within medium or large industrial companies.Morocco 2050 31 4.2.3. Questions and queries It is important to mobilize manufacturers and win their support for the transition project The ability to effectively mobilize all manufacturers and stakeholders on the aspects fundamentals of the energy transition and a massive reduction in GHG emissions remain to be demonstrate: energy efficiency pooling of efforts in industry (and other sectors) do not live up to expectations and the potential for efficiency energy remains to be implemented. This is due to many factors such as the multiplicity of actors residual subsidies for certain petroleum products (butane) efficiency projects renewable, for example. It is therefore considered necessary to accelerate energy efficiency efforts in industry by building on the success of programs such as MORSEFF (10). The industry transition can only take place if it is clearly oriented by the public authorities and pushed through by a system integrating incentives (taxation already in preparation both internationally (the Green Value Chain credit line and more recently the Green Economy Financial Facility) and at the national level with the AMEE. It may be useful to start with the large manufacturers and best equipped to make the transition small size. Efforts must be focused on the deployment of solutions that promote gains in productivity and control of the energy bill in such a way as to quickly gain the support of contractors. A strong constraint lies in the reluctance of manufacturers to share information and data otherwise essential to the implementation of the transition. There is therefore a need for change mentalities on this point and establish a climate of trust. The techno-economic trajectories for the decarbonization of industry still present uncertainties If decarbonization options and trajectories emerge for electricity sectors and construction through technological breakthroughs and cost reductions industry are less clearly established steel Energy-intensive industries represent a significant share of emissions but also cases particular on a technical level given the fact that most carbon-free processes are still far from being competitive in terms of cost. It is therefore important to establish diagnostics and “decarbonization” roadmaps for each industrial sector and each production process. manufacturing because a global approach remains insufficient and too imprecise. It is also necessary to distinguish the sectors subject to international competition from those which are not. Despite the uncertainties it is nevertheless important to respect the hierarchy of decarbonization solutions which start with energy efficiency uses and finally hydrogen and its derivatives). The opportunities offered by international cooperation in terms of decarbonization (technology Set up a broad stakeholder consultation To ensure its realism and appropriation requires the involvement and commitment of all stakeholders at the national level sectoral. Having a shared vision is necessary but not sufficient. You have to formulate a strategy that meets the needs and expectations of manufacturers, which implies placing them at the center of the programming and planning process (e.g. joint development of objectives to be achieved). He It is also proposed to integrate the vision into the prerogatives of local authorities by giving them significant autonomy in order to best manage the specificities of each region in terms of industrial specialization (10) http://www.morseff.com/fr/# 32 Long Term Low Carbon Strategy 4.2.4. From sectoral vision to strategy: proposals for work on industry • Finely characterize the energy uses of industry by distinguishing between the different sectors IGCE and ILCE and assess the decarbonization potential of each based on technological assumptions. savings on the various possible solutions: energy efficiency fossil fuels process modernization “circular” eco-parks •  On this basis major branches and industrial sectors in close collaboration with companies and ministries concerned who will ultimately have to validate hypotheses and scenarios; • Put in place an indicative roadmap for the decarbonization of industry: scenarios and objectives figures for 2030 electrification of uses • Establish a technological and R&D roadmap for the industry sector adapted to reality industry and innovation-research in Morocco (to be broken down by sub-sector); • Identify and propose the establishment of taxation and incentives favorable to investments companies in the tools and technologies allowing deep decarbonization: eco-taxes CO2 market and price • Assess the opportunities and risks of the energy transition for cost and non-cost competitiveness. morocco cost SWOT analysis (11) particularly in the clean technology sectors (e.g. clean vehicles). Attention special will be given to SMEs and VSEs • Identify the main indicators for monitoring and evaluating the decarbonization of the industry sector and set up an adequate MRV information system. 4.3. Building sector 4.3.1. State of play In Morocco CO2 emissions – mainly in the residential sector – i.e. an apparently limited weight particularly compared to that of the energy sector (40%). However, it must be taken into account that approximately half of the emissions from the energy sector are emissions indirectly induced by the building building therefore represents approximately one third of the emissions importance in low carbon strategies. (11) Strengths The state of play in Morocco The inventory shows that the various issues identified have been properly taken into account. internationally. The main difficulties seem to lie in the implementation at the local level national guidelines. The multi-scale dimension is recognized roadmaps applying from the building to the smart city. Major potential has been identified for new buildings (between 100 and 150,000 housing units per year depending on years). For the new accessibility to services (public and commercial). Standards for equipment and a guide Sustainable City technique have been developed The dimension of the life cycle of the building is increasingly taken into account in the effort to normalization. It requires consideration of the issue of materials which are often not energy intensive and adapted to local conditions. Introduction digital technologies will be increasingly important in urban travel. The need for better exemplary public buildings is noted. At last the building which participates in the Global Alliance for Building and Construction and the NAMA-Habitat facility. The key themes The confrontation of international roadmaps and the inventory of fixtures in Morocco leads to identify four key themes: • The need to adopt a systemic approach through the integration of urban policies for new towns as well as existing ones; • The importance of the multi-scale approach and policy “alignment” organizational and technological • The challenge of social inclusion underlying the implementation of policies because the building and the associated energy consumption constitutes a very large share of household budgets in particular for the most disadvantaged categories; and • The challenges of developing sustainable buildings in terms of industrial activity competitiveness and employment HPE households. 4.3.2. Sector vision statement (12) In the perspective of a sustainable and low-carbon urban planning "central brick" which must integrate both the design elements and the equipment that meet the requirements for resident comfort and energy efficiency: •  Upstream designed to ensure good accessibility to public and commercial services obviously to the different job categories. • Downstream air conditioning) will have to meet High Performance standards as soon as possible Energetic (5). Low-carbon urban development presupposes taking forms of urbanization into account: favoring the densification of existing fabrics during urban renewal operations modulating the density according to the public transport service land urban mix and limiting the creation of monofunctional zones. It is also necessary to promote green frameworks by preserving green spaces sensitive natural areas green (12) The 8 strategic axes of the roadmaps are indicated here by a number in parentheses. 34 Long Term Low Carbon Strategy For new construction (2) possible "with positive energy" stage is undoubtedly that of the application of so-called “passive” solutions of the building and the use of suitable materials climatic conditions of Morocco allow a strong mobilization of renewable energies (8) in particular through solar water heaters and the self-production of photovoltaic electricity. For housing individual through decentralized solutions – possibly with the mobilization of electricity storage. For collective housing district power stations on spaces dedicated to this purpose or for mixed use (commercial roofs parkings). The General Energy Efficiency Regulations apply to residential and tertiary buildings at edify thermal insulation of buildings in order to reduce the heating and air conditioning needs of buildings national energy source and reduce GHG emissions. It fixes the thermal characteristics that must respect each type of building (residential or tertiary) For existing buildings (3) involves the promotion and use of traditional and local techniques and materials (6). Those materials have properties that are particularly conducive to "passive management" of flows energy region. They also allow for the best retrofit options historical architectural heritage. A new generation of urban planning documents forms the basis for all projects planning and regulates the location of the various buildings. It should also be remembered that a Bill relating to town planning documents is being drawn up which incorporates the principles of sustainable development and promotes low-carbon planning, in particular through: the control of urban sprawl through the rationalization of land consumption and the incentive renewal and revitalization of spaces peripheries; preservation of agricultural areas natural ecological; control of travel and accessibility needs; the diversity of functions and quality of spaces. Innovation must play a key role. But while advanced digital technologies are likely to bring an optimization of the transport systems will have to rely above all on “frugal innovations” building design traditional and local techniques and materials should not lead to underestimating the importance of other technological innovations important to always use household appliances and conditioning equipment High Energy Performance (5); then all its place in optimizing uses and limiting consumption (4). The integration of traditional solutions and modern technologies must be thought out in a perspective taking into account the management of the building over its entire lifespan (6) to "deconstruction" (rather than "demolition"). Thus the building can fit into the perspective of a circular economy recycling of the various components. Finally, the sustainable building must ensure the best protection possible of the inhabitants against natural risks (7) extremes (drought heat waves) or disasters (seismic risks Furthermore reinforce in the architectural design the integration of the constraints of hygiene and distancing.Morocco 2050 35 4.3.3. The conditions for success and the levers for action Beyond the elements of vision and action levers specific to the building sector that the success of the low-carbon transition in this sector will also have to be based on several cross-cutting strategic dimensions A shared vision The first condition of a low carbon trajectory for the building lies in the necessary reflection on the future of land use planning in Morocco: the town-country scheme cities and the urban structure will be decisive for the choice of suitable solutions for the building. All initiatives aimed at managing housing issues in an integrated manner accessibility to services can contribute to an intrinsically more restrained development than the currently dominant model. This is undoubtedly the first step to take. The second key issue refers first to the question of the total level of consumption of energy and then to that of the energy mix consumed (share of network electricity local renewable energies fully developed only from an exercise in the construction of quantified strategic scenarios (with or without a model) as part of an overall energy dashboard (like the dashboards of the Deep Decarbonization Pathways project (13)). Such a quantified vision will have to be shared between the various stakeholders. She constitutes undoubtedly the condition for a convergence of expectations and thus a partial lifting of uncertainties in many areas: regulatory dynamics investment of the building The necessary framework Some quantified objectives are available (for example that of 52% of electricity from renewable in 2030). But it is clear that today there is a lack of a quantified vision allowing us to build an image of the Moroccan energy system different time horizons But if these horizons seem distant they are preparing today built infrastructure and the underlying changes needed to achieve a low-carbon future. This vision should be able to rely not only on energy variables projections in terms of urban development (which agglomerations park structure (residential / tertiary household appliances and thermal comfort established The quantitative framework would also make it possible to construct and compare different temporalities: current trends; the medium-term objectives (2030); and the longer-term directions of la LT-LEDS. Thus, a system for continuous monitoring of the transition in the building would be set up. This device must make it possible to observe and measure the evolution of performance both in the construction new than in the renovation of the old in a multi-annual framework (4-5 years). The levers to be mobilized Among the first levers to be mobilized appears the need for extensive preparation of documents town planning which must be adapted both to local conditions and to the objectives pursued at national scale. in parallel Morocco must lead to a permanent adjustment of this regulation according to the performances measured and the difficulties encountered. (13) https://www.iddri.org/en/publications-and-events/decryptage/impact-deep-decarbonization-pathways-project-ddpp-domestic36 Long Term Low Carbon Strategy The question of the energy impacts of major land development projects is today already taken into account in the legislation. It also appears that the design of new towns in island structure (and not linear) would be likely to minimize travel. Likewise the vision of a reasonably dense city with multifunctional neighborhoods should limit it all energy needs (comfort and movement). In these reflections, it is necessary to take into account the fact that today's developments will be a significant part of the park in 2050. Public buildings will be important for their exemplary effects for energy performance and waste management. Likewise the public order ensure the promotion of solutions adapted to low-carbon development. This taking into account internal obstacles specific to the administration or ignorance of these solutions refers to the issue of awareness-training for public officials territorial administrations. Design references and standards adapted to the different scales as well as to the conditions local regions must provide effective support for professionals in the sector architects l’ecodesign life of the building. Obviously the references for the construction must accompany the constant evolution of standards towards more performance. To comply with these standards also strengthen the ex post control mechanisms accompanied by penalties. The development of low-carbon buildings therefore presupposes the training and mobilization of different trades and different categories of businesses. The issue of specific skills is essential for the achievement of objectives in Morocco and possibly for the export of know-how in other African countries. What economic incentives? Given the importance of housing expenditure – including energy – in the budgets of households two dimensions: recurrent energy expenditure for thermal comfort (summer-winter) household appliances; the corresponding investment expenditure buildings For households initial to save recurring consumption of fossil fuels. This therefore assumes that the fundamentals of economic equations are consistent with this process. A solution theory consists of increasing the price of fossil fuels enough to make the balance sheet favorable investment (carbon taxation). It is attractive in its simplicity but unenforceable as is. To be able to manage the consequences on household budgets of the most modest prudent and gradual increase in the cost of fossil fuels and, on the contrary, a reduction in low carbon investment costs. The issue of financing energy control/efficiency and self-production operations of local energy is therefore essential. The public order of a new type The industrial dimension of the production of renewable energy equipment or equipment heating-air conditioning or high energy performance household appliances must not be under- estimated. It can contribute significantly to lowering costs job creation. 4.3.4. From sectoral vision to strategy: proposals for work on the building • For the building sector demographic prospects and prospects for land use planning and housing particularly from the point of view of the organization of large cities small towns and finally rural areas; Morocco 2050 37 • This housing forecast should in particular explore the type of habitat favored in the new towns or districts collective and individual; • The development of the tertiary sector must be studied in parallel in order to assess the needs in dedicated buildings in the different regions; • A typology of building and energy solutions adapted to the different regional conditions in climatic zoning terms must make it possible to characterize typical energy consumption and the associated needs in equipment; • The prospective quantification of energy needs and associated emissions should be based on on : at. the qualitative elements resulting from the orientations of the development policies urbanization and housing; b. the identification of the various solutions adapted to satisfy the comfort needs of the households; and finally vs. detailed quantization consistent with the above two points demand on the main demand segments. 4.4. Transport sector 4.4.1. State of play In Morocco significant since it is the second sector for direct emissions (40%). The associated consumption and emissions stem almost exclusively from those of fossil fuels consumption is high The sector represents a major strategic challenge modal choices its characteristics is that today the fleet of equipment is largely dependent on the solutions conventional. A low-carbon transition will therefore require both better control of request and The state of play in Morocco The diversity of challenges and solutions are well recognized by national mobility roadmaps (Department of Transport) and Sustainable Urban Mobility (Ministry of Interior) mobility studies The “Sustainable Mobility for Morocco” roadmap has its origins in the Paris Process for Mobility and Climate (PPMC). It is part of various national systems such as: the Strategy National Council for Sustainable Development (issues: governance climate change) ; Nationally Determined Contribution 2030 (2018); the law Framework 99-12 relating to the National Charter for the Environment and Sustainable Development; the Moroccan Strategy for Logistics 2018; the Energy Efficiency Strategy and the Strategy energy at 2030; the programming of investments in transport infrastructure; the plan National Adaptation; the Road Safety Strategy 2017-2026; the Industrial Acceleration Plan 2020; advanced regionalization and modernization of the civil service; the pact for exemplary administration. Strategic planning integrating these roadmaps would provide a solid basis for better to manage investments and to improve the effectiveness of policies promotion of intermodality. For now conventional fossil fuel vehicles merchandise. The question of controlling needs and their dynamics is rarely addressed in as such. In this perspective travel needs and optimize transport systems overall system efficiency. The development of new technological solutions – electric vehicles (bicycles automobiles) and beyond hydrogen vehicles – calls for rigorous and articulated programming on different time horizons route: pilot operations on captive fleets recharge/distribution Five strategic issues The confrontation of international roadmaps and the inventory of fixtures in Morocco leads to identify five key themes. The first three refer to the logic "Behaviors - Infrastructures - technology”. The next two relate more to the impacts of low transport strategies carbon household budgets. To promote behaviors and investments that support low-carbon transport conditions seem to have to be retained: 1. The development of urban infrastructure conducive to good accessibility to public services and commercial; 2. Policies for improving performance (intermodality 3. The construction of industrial capacities for the production of the vehicles of the future and their components; 4. Incentive systems combining information-awareness and economic incentives (petrol price policy); and 5. Taking household budgetary constraints into account and implementing measures reducing the investment effort. With regard to urban transport infrastructure in enhanced cooperation between the Ministry of the Interior local. The BHLS and tram deployment strategy is also essential: to be attractive Ferré must ensure the development of TGVs For equipment performance performance of vehicles placed on the market by the regulations. But in the medium term develop an electrification strategy for all types of vehicles: scooters light commercial vehicles in the longer term (2030) the question will arise of the introduction of hydrogen in transport and the trade-off between this use and other possible uses of hydrogen (industry power grid balancing These deployment plans for zero-emission vehicles must be matched by a genuine strategy to the industrial sectors for the production of components and the assembly of vehicles. These sectors should meet domestic needs on export. The transport transition must also make it possible to respond in a more satisfactory and inclusive way needs to dynamic must be sought between policy of increasing the price of fossil fuels (e.g. taxation carbon emissions) and support for investments in new vehicles (scrap bonuses ecological conversion). 4.4.2. Sector vision statement In a low emissions strategy for 2050 due to the importance and dynamics of emissions. The future of the transport system must be designed from a multiscale and multimodal perspective and for different time horizons. This integrated approach is necessary for the design of passenger transport systems in order to promote flexibility in use. Furthermore of goods can have positive and structuring transverse effects on the whole of the economy Delivery. Upstream infrastructure policy is which must be managed in a coordinated manner: urban transport infrastructures and those relating to to intercity transport great attention must be paid to comfort For road transport rely on a monitoring system with observable indicators. Firstly policies requires that the setting of objectives for 2050 consider the current trajectories as well as the targets previously set for 2030. On the other hand established : • For the short term (before 2030) the priority could be to rapidly introduce new standards for the consumption and emissions of vehicles placed on the market, whether new or second hand ; • The medium term (2030-2035) could be dominated by the need to invest massively in the development of new infrastructure; and • Beyond that, the question of the large-scale deployment of zero-emission vehicles will arise. electric To control vehicle consumption to ensure better compliance with the various standards and regulations (axle taxes tires must play an exemplary role constitute a very important niche market for the rise in experience and skills professional An adapted industrial strategy must make it possible to fill the gaps in the national chains of production zero emission vehicles in sequence on: public fleets etc 40 Long Term Low Carbon Strategy 4.4.3. Questions and queries Uncertainties In the current situation the entire legislative framework and regulatory systems regions and local communities. A review of regulations and legislative texts is in progress. ongoing effect new perspectives Uncertainties also stem from the difficulty of articulating an integrated overall scheme for infrastructure multi-scale transport policies should in fact make it possible to reduce disparities and improve social inclusion in all regions. The question of accessibility to services and opening up of rural areas is particularly important with a view to reducing inequality and inclusive development. The review can be conducted as part of the development 2040 Rail Plans and 2040 Road Plan. The conditions for success Among the objectives to be achieved wide accessibility public transport safety be integrated into a quantified vision and flows construction of a long-term strategy difficulty is also that this framework must be able to be revised at regular intervals obtained long term. To do this quantified objectives in an LT-LEDS Dashboard. The conditions for satisfying the various objectives of transport policy are based before all about the buy-in and active participation of the various stakeholders. In the conditions also appears the need to revise the objectives the local collectives safe public transport example in the form of Local Development Companies associating the private sector and a strong power of community control. For freight governance. The management of freight systems must in any case be based on a regulatory framework well defined. The management of new logistics zones and freight must anticipate the reduction in volumes transported due to consolidation and technical optimization. The question of the informal sector transition avoid unfair competition For the deployment of zero-emission vehicles, it will be necessary to define a clear framework allowing to articulate not only the different time horizons problem: development of technical solutions conversion aids 4.4.4. From sectoral vision to strategy: proposals for work on transport • For transport term must go territory and organization of cities; • Forecasting of transport flows must be based on the analysis of four different segments in a quadrant: passenger/goods transport and urban/interurban transport; • For each of the four segments, the infrastructure needs should first be identified starting with rail infrastructure for intercity or public transit for towns ; Morocco 2050 41 • In addition to this infrastructure planning public transport of people and rail transport of goods logistics plan sociological; • Prospects for the electrification of different categories of vehicles (scooters light commercial vehicles) must be quantified for different time horizons by distinguishing a phasing: niche markets • These elements may also be the subject of specific discussions, including on: ◆ the consequences of this rise in power of electric motorization for industry Morocco in terms of development of charging infrastructure vehicles ◆ incentive schemes for the development of low-carbon mobility zero emission vehicles fossil fuels with investment aid for the conversion of vehicles. 4.5. Agriculture sector 4.5.1. State of play Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture in Morocco According to the Moroccan GHG Sectoral Inventory Moroccan amount to 20 44% to farms (83% according to the FAO) ruminants burnt 7% according to FAOSTAT. The sink function of UTCAT is also to be taken into account since the crude carbon well represented by arboriculture was 8 Mt CO2e / year in 2014 according to the SNIGES. Morocco has 9 21 million hectares of rangeland. Agricultural production is dominated by cereals 59% of areas harvested market gardening (fruits and vegetables) and industrial crops (beet and sugar cane). The irrigated areas represent 1 strongly from year to year Livestock farming includes just under 6 million LMU (Large Livestock Unit) of cattle draft animals (donkeys poultry according to the Ministry of Agriculture. Meat and milk production has doubled in 20 years partly by the growth of livestock (poultry in particular) milk and meat productivity. According to the FAO per year fertilizer (nitrogen are estimated at 3%.42 Long-Term Low Carbon Strategy Food availability per person is 3,400 kcal per day are 98 grams per day per person recommended nutritional allowances compared to 2000. Several key food indicators have improved in 20 years (availability food) prevalence of anemia in women). Domestic availability (i.e. supply) is increasing (+20% in 20 years) on the one hand thanks to the increase the productivity of Moroccan agriculture in general (+11% for cereals Red (+60%). Especially grain imports closer to 7 million tons while the country produces 8 million. These are especially the animal feed that has increased (x 3) primarily to feed poultry consumption has doubled. The share of agriculture in GDP remains at 12 with fluctuations in cereal yields subject to rainfall. Agriculture employs 37% of the active population and remains a major labor sector for the country. Half of farms value less than 3 hectares. State of work and reflections on climate change and the agricultural sector in Morocco The Green Generation strategy (2020-2030) succeeded the Green Morocco Plan (2008-2020) as strategic framework of public policy orientations in Morocco; this is based on two foundations ambitions of this strategy are to double the share of agriculture in GDP export earnings between 2018 and 2030 180,000 young farmers strong desire to develop sectors with high added value, particularly for export models of cooperative agriculture and soil conservation techniques water efficiency while promoting the use of renewable energies for irrigation the use of biomass. These plans are also in close interaction with the National Water Saving Program in Irrigation (PNEEI) 2010-2020 then 2020-2027. The national biomass strategy publication pastoralism Other programs are in progress part are the subject of particular attention in the National Strategy for Sustainable Development in horizon 2030 has benefited since 2015 from a NAMA of arganiculture Arganiculture in a Degraded Environment) which allowed the planting of 10,000 ha of argan trees. Regarding the role of the agricultural sector in Moroccan climate policy primarily address the issue of adaptation. Moroccan agriculture will be subject to strong climatic constraints. The control of water resources appears as the essential element critical. It is to be considered in its quantitative dimension in regions of intensive production with heavy use of fertilizers or pesticides. Access to water brings into play mechanisms of competition between irrigation and the proper functioning of natural ecosystems (including forests) expected from the mobilizable potential seawater or the mobilization of alternative resources (wastewater). Irrigated agriculture represents 45% of the added value of agriculture in an average year. The objectives of the different programs aim to improve irrigation improve productivity the use of fertilizers.Morocco 2050 43 The vagaries of food production remain a threat to the food security of the population. Interannual variations which have decreased in recent years strongly. The role of agriculture in reducing CO2 emissions of fossil origin remains to be clarified. Agriculture consumes 1,200 ktoe of energy potential can represent a quarter of this consumption solar pumping. Agriculture can also provide bioenergy Concerning the LUCAT part of agriculture year (in particular thanks to the gross sink of 8 Mt CO2e/year linked to arboriculture) according to SNIGES. In the years to come, however, the question will arise of maintaining this sink function transformations linked to climate change and the degree of saturation of the current well. 4.5.2. Sector vision statement Adapt the Moroccan production system to a food demand that is set to grow in quantity and quality Overall food demand in Morocco is set to increase in the coming decades under the main action of population growth. Furthermore will take an increasing place among the issues to be addressed. Moroccan citizens by health issues both in terms of quality requirements (organic sugars and cereals). These transformations in urban settings. The ongoing urbanization in Morocco is therefore a factor of intensification of this trend It is possible and desirable to direct demand through education policies (labels, etc.). Conversely know who benefits from the positive effects of market developments. To answer social equity and fair remuneration of producers by intermediaries must be considered. In this perspective by domestic demand remuneration of producers. This coupling could go through the regulation and structuring of markets favoring short circuits. Improve the competitiveness of Moroccan producers nationally and internationally The Green Morocco Plan strategy development of high value-added sectors Moroccan agriculture new quality requirements with regulatory value. These programs have borne fruit and should be continued in the future. However agricultural population competitiveness. It is particularly relevant to analyze future climate change in order to characterize the future production or recovery methods to be implemented according to the territories and more broadly the future vocations of arable land. Thereby ecosystems rendered by agricultural areas promote the resilience of fragile populations practicing subsistence farming (livestock farming in the mountains for example). In other words interesting to reward their multiple roles. It should be noted that some participants argue that the revision of the vocation of agricultural land must concern all farms only the most precarious productivist can affect all territories. Such valuation work will require the production and agglomeration of a lot of data. quantitative data to guide and prioritize decision-making all the information necessary for all players and to promote the advantages of the sector.44 Long-Term Low Carbon Strategy Waste and recovery The themes of waste and waste recovery are inevitable when imagining the future of a carbon-free agriculture. The Morocco organic decrease the pressure on it. In the first place or the placing on the market of uncalibrated products Next agricultural products (margins such as composting or methanisation. These latter financially (fertility) or the carbon impact of the sectors. The possibility of PPP (as with the OCP Group Office Cherifien des Phosphates) should be considered to organize these outlets. Carry out an ambitious policy on the issue of water Water resources are inseparable from tillage. However important water sources Numerous optimization and efficiency initiatives have been successfully undertaken on the initiative government (40% of drip irrigation) of water reaching 2 Gm3. However taking into account the crucial subject of the Moroccan groundwater in the recent National Water Plan encourage us to open the debate on the definition of even more ambitious measures by 2050 in the perspective of the sustainable management of this precious resource. For example, it is possible to drastically strengthen the programs already underway to desalinate seawater over the long term. term for food uses (8 existing stations such as Greater Agadir and projects like in Casablanca) Other essential factors of production deteriorated in recent years crucial issues in defining the roadmap towards 2050. 4.5.3. Questions and queries What trajectory should be envisaged for the share of animal protein on the Moroccan plate? The subject of animal protein consumption years following the Green Morocco plan the increase in the share of meat others suggest bending the curve of meat protein consumption today profit from legumes Livestock can be roughly divided into ruminant and monogastric animals. If the GHG emissions from ruminants linked in particular to enteric fermentation rearing monogastrics such as meat poultry also brings its share of constraints dependence on grain imports to feed them. The quantification of these impacts in the perspective of Morocco in 2050 will be a key step in determining the guidelines related to animal husbandry and animal protein consumption in the country. Should production methods be oriented towards more intensive or agroecological practices? Can these two approaches coexist in the current model? These last years sustainability of Moroccan agriculture Many works are underway to build a resilient Moroccan agriculture on water plans international a desire to develop an agricultural model perceived as too conventional by some parties stakeholders in particular, it was suggested during the workshops that the current ambitions concerning the development organic sectors could be revised upwards agricultural land. It was also proposed to reinforce the appellations with notions of terroirs to improve the competitiveness of areas where intensive agriculture is not suitable. Conversely some suggest investing in research to reduce the numbers of less productive for higher yields. The debate is therefore not closed. In the current model evolution intensive and conservation. The second is the prerogative of smallholders whose access to different factors of production is limited In this perspective supported by a solid information system However, the perspective of this cohabitation is not totally shared by all. Some parts stakeholders argue that a systems approach involves bringing together all supply chains value moreover (and vice versa). A change of model would therefore be necessary to imagine the implementation using different production methods. This could not be done without the farmers would be the first to take on the constraints such as work deemed more intensive. Priorities for Moroccan production: Moroccan consumers or export? Moroccan food exports are today mostly considered as essential for the inflow of foreign currency that they induce country's trade. However great national food autonomy. These two sides of the same coin are today compatible with fruits and vegetables interior availability dependent on imports the share of national productions on the Moroccan plate from a perspective of resilience and food security. These diverse visions on the requests to be satisfied as a priority are directly correlated with choices of different production models the creation of the roadmap towards 2050. As part of the development of the export strategy the importance of the argan sector was suggested to build on this success to go even further in the exploitation of this culture. 4.5.4. From sectoral vision to strategy: proposals for work on agriculture • Assess the climate impact of agricultural strategies: Generation Green can be translated into GHG emissions carbon content of agricultural and food products. This assessment should include a report on the use of surfaces social and environmental impacts; • Pursue research with a prospective objective agroclimatic conditions by 2050, making it possible to assess changes in the yields of the main agricultural production water in particular; • Define post-2030 orientations more productive but generating adverse effects (qualitative and quantitative degradation of the water resource soil conservation • Better assess the potential for carbon storage in agriculture with the development of agroforestry and new agronomic practices; • Fully integrate biodiversity issues into agricultural strategies; • Define a food strategy integrating not only food security issues also the notion of “overall health” based on both nutrition and health on notions of the impact of production methods on the environment and quality of life; 46 Long Term Low Carbon Strategy • Assess the potential for reducing losses and waste throughout the supply chain as well as the potential for recycling organic waste associated; and • Set up a communication strategy with professional organizations of the agriculture and the local population to make them aware of the notions of GHGs but also of actions that can be taken at their level to reduce these emissions. 4.6. Forest sector 4.6.1. State of play Greenhouse gas emissions from Morocco's forests According to government sources of natural forests forest area would increase by 38,000 hectares per year on average forests are subject to degradation every year. The Moroccan forest is overexploited both by over-harvesting of fuelwood 3 times the production capacity. According to the National GHG Inventory 8 MtCO2e/an informally. The forest alone therefore stored approximately 2 Mt CO2e in 2014. By adding the 1 Mt CO2e/year of emissions linked to annual crops and the 8 Mt CO2e/year of attributable storage to arboriculture 2014. However, there are annual variations in forest GHG fluxes directly correlated to changes in forest areas. They mainly depend on the degradation of wooded areas and the density of cover by wood-energy uses and silvopastoral. Removals and mortality seem to exceed regeneration capacities of the forest. The issue of the sustainability of the forest carbon sink is thus particularly significant. for the coming years Roundwood production is 7 million m3 per year heating 1 and paper pulp according to the sources at 5 to 11 million tons informal firewood. Sector particularly vulnerable to climate change for climate change mitigation and adaptation.Morocco 2050 47 State of work and reflections on climate change and the forestry sector in Morocco Morocco's forest policy is described in Morocco's Forest Strategy 2020-2030 presented to the King on February 13, 2020. Other documents concern the strategy for sylvo-pastoralism The forest is threatened by the overexploitation of resources (firewood essential sources of income or economy for local rural populations. Limit the access of precarious rural populations to the forest without taking special measures would therefore lead to poverty consequences to farms and imposing on the inhabitants either an energy sobriety suffered more expensive energy sources. The strategies concerned therefore take these aspects into account by insisting in particular on of governance that take the user into account and are located at an appropriate territorial level. It's the principle of the "inhabited forest" which integrates the social issue The 2030 vision is also based on a sustainability strategy that aims not to destroy capital natural but on the contrary to preserve it iconic. Finally, the productive function of the forest is not forgotten the mobilization of productive potential in order to meet Morocco's demand for wood and products from the forest Morocco's forest strategy aims to restore 133,000 ha of forest cover by 2030 and to add a market value of 2 to 5 billion dirhams at an overall valuation of 17 billion dirhams annual attributed to the Moroccan forest. The success rate of past reforestation is estimated at 48% only after two years The strategy. 4.6.2. Sector vision statement A context of increasing pressure on resources and transformation of populations rural The multifunctionality of forest areas makes it a strategic sector coming years an increase in pressure on its resources production factors. Forests support a multiplicity of uses, many of which other sectors lack of ambitious actions foresters imbalance of water cycles essential to the sustainability of Moroccan territories. On the social plan growing globalization and the socio-cultural changes it engenders. Access to new technologies (internet to destabilize the rural social fabric require a comprehensive approach The involvement and education of young people around issues related to wooded areas is therefore a central to creating a sustainable future for the intertwined forest and water sectors. In effect globalization and socio-environmental aspects of the territories. Substitution of uses and efficiency To limit pressure on forest resources are technical: substitution and efficiency. Regarding substitution place convergence of intersectoral policies in a national approach in order to replace 48 Long-Term Low Carbon Strategy extra-forest resources to the productions and services of wooded areas and thus prevent the overexploitation. The mutual impacts between the sectors concerned would then have to be analyzed in order to anticipate the consequences of such choices. The subject of firewood or even butane on a detailed analysis of the carbon balance of each of the fuels in order not to penalize the balance global If substitution helps preserve forest resources efficiency measures in a low climate impact approach maximum before searching for the most relevant fuel. Reduce the need by optimizing the use of the resource is a priority in the definition of a roadmap towards 2050. In this perspective approach to be cultivated in the context of quantified impact monitoring. It should be noted that the government is already moving in this direction steam rooms. It is now essential to define a clear governance around the subject to allow for action. Valorization of ecosystem services and new uses The following levers concern the development of forest areas. This is on the one hand to attribute a financial value to the ecosystem services provided by the forest sectors their role as carbon sinks The protection of forest areas depends on their economic development. That's why he seems appropriate to strengthen the economic links between the forest sector and the sectors that indirectly benefit from the services provided by wooded areas (hydric regulation biodiversity, etc.) in order to financially reward these services. These links can for example be created through PPPs or incentive or disincentive tax policies (such as payments for environmental services). In addition to the valuation of induced externalities high value-added production endemic to forested areas. If forestry projects intensive are already underway aromatic or medicinal. The latter benefit from a potential market in the industry pharmaceutical the country's trade balance by offsetting imports of high-tech products through high value-added exports. What's more could constitute a relevant lever to interest donors in internationally and create a positive ripple effect around the forestry sector. At last benefit local populations while promoting the sustainability of forest carbon stocks. Territorial management of governance and subsidies The multiplicity and diversity of Moroccan forest areas requires differentiated management of the production in a national initiative at each locality knowledge of the forests of each territory. As part of the implementation of a new forest management financing solutions to offer compensation to local beneficiaries of services foresters additional factors should be considered: on the one hand who have the opportunity to invest in future economic activities associated with spaces wooded and will lose part of the benefits generated by the current use of forest resources. In order to finance the various programs that can be envisaged in the long term make more intensive use of international aid which Morocco is certainly not one of the priority countries Conversely, some stakeholders based on sustainable national resources. Preservation Despite severe financial constraints on the forestry sector economy should not overshadow the issues of resilience and sustainability related to the forest. The definition of a roadmap towards 2050 will therefore have to reconcile these ambitions with ecological imperatives linked to the roles of carbon sinks and reservoirs of biodiversity in forests: the preservation and development of native species land and legal security of certain forest areas are among the measures to be perpetuated. Among the action proposals of certain stakeholders • Reforestation of 3 Mha by 2050, of which at least 50% around urban agglomerations (big cities factories and households. By evaluating the rate of absorption in relation to the forecast emissions of these agglomerations over the next 30 years. • The flooding of the national market with imported lumber at a very competitive price on the Next 10 years to deter illegal logging and “confront the timber mafia” to protect the Atlas cedar in a critical situation Quantitative studies and data aggregation To promote the concrete and optimal application of these solutions quantitative studies and scientific contributions in order to correctly anticipate the social and future choices and make informed decisions. Impact diagnostics potentials and ex-post project evaluations are all tools for prioritizing the solutions and focus efforts on priority issues and significant actions. In this perspective are heterogeneous and scattered. It is therefore a question of coordinating intra- and intersectoral actors to pool and aggregate the data needed to model the impacts. These data will be used as support for the R&D work that will be carried out as well as for the actions of raising awareness among the various stakeholders. 4.6.3. Questions and queries What degree of appropriation of forest areas by rural populations? Rural development is one of the pillars of the preservation of forest areas. As such it is essential to involve local populations in participatory management of spaces forests so that they appropriate them. During the workshop local populations was no longer sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural territories level of the sustainability of resources and the quality of life of the inhabitants. In a context industrialization of the exploitation of resources linked in particular to the strong urban development of the Morocco such as community reforestation where long-term contracts can be made with the tribal leaders supported by significant investments would help reduce objections local workforce avoiding conflicts of interest and empowering local actors. The question of the appropriation of forest land is also closely linked to the issue of overgrazing. In effect it is essential to ensure the subsistence of the populations who depend on it. The question must then be asked about substitution mechanisms reconcile ecological and social interests. 50 Long Term Low Carbon Strategy Should we rethink the governance of the sector and what are the priorities in terms of the legal framework? Major projects have been launched around the forest they had set themselves (48% success rate for reforestation programs). In order to improve the results of the work done stakeholders considered. On the other hand legal. However existing. Thereby workshops to fight against the unreasonable exploitation of forest resources by certain entities endanger Moroccan forests in the medium term. These measures would aim to control the demand and to achieve a balance between the users of wooded areas rural or industrial. At last steeped in the reality of the field and to involve them more strongly in the debates 4.6.4. From sectoral vision to strategy: proposals for work on the forest • Establish an indicative long-term roadmap for strengthening the role of forests as carbon sink: ◆ in particular (sinks/emissions) of the forest-wood sector with a systemic vision taking into account all the functions of the forest: produce resources (wood medicinal) ◆ identify the main indicators of a system for monitoring and evaluating the progress made. This system must be responsive allowing frequent readjustment of measures and actions; ◆ deal in these scenarios with the entire timber industry materials) imports and exports. • Dealing with issues of land use competition, particularly with agriculture (competition between reforestation strategies and maintenance of agricultural land fodder provided by the forest through agriculture); • Carry out an impact study of the different scenarios economic biodiversity; • Arbitrate great forest features; • Build a forest strategy 2030-2050 at both national and regional level major forest region or by type of forest ecosystem relevant at each of these levels; • Integrate the role of local populations as potential agents of heritage preservation forest and its biodiversity and the means to remedy it; and • Establish a Research and Development roadmap as well as reinforcement actions capacities adapted to the needs and conditions of the country: ◆ boosting innovation in the various planned actions; ◆ improve and adapt the production system of forest ecosystems to national needs and the imperatives of mitigating GHG emissions and adapting to the effects of climate change global.Morocco 2050 51 4.7. Waste sector 4.7.1. State of play CO2 emissions from Morocco's waste sector According to figures from the Fourth National Communication (QCN) of waste represents 5,086 Morocco. Diffuse methane emissions from managed waste disposal sites represent 1 135 unmanaged waste disposal accounts for 2,196 total GHG emissions from the solid waste sector. Emissions from the water treatment sector used represent 1,755 waste. Breakdown of sector emissions of waste in 2018 in Gg Eq.CO2 State of play of the waste sector in Morocco Since 2008 management of household and similar waste PNDM the environment and the Ministry of the Interior and aimed essentially at: • Ensure the collection and cleaning of household waste to achieve a collection rate of 85% in 2016 and 90% in 2020; • Create landfill and recovery centers for the benefit of all urban centers (100%) in 2020; 52 Long Term Low Carbon Strategy • Rehabilitate or close all existing landfills (100%) by 2020; • Modernize the waste sector by professionalizing the sector; • Develop the “sorting-recycling-recovery” sector 20% recycling rate in 2020; • Generalize master plans for the management of household and similar waste for all Kingdom prefectures and provinces; and • Train and raise awareness of all the actors concerned on the issue of waste. Besides was retained as a mitigation measure allowing a reduction of nearly 4 tonnes of CO2eq by 2030. This reduction potential is the result of the combined actions waste recycling energy as well as TMB coupled with co-incineration in cement kilns. Regarding sewage Wastewater (PNA) was launched in 2005 jointly by the Department of the Environment and the Ministry of the Interior. The objectives of the NAP for 2020 and 2030 are as follows: • Achieve an overall connection rate to the sanitation network in urban areas of 75% by 2016 • Achieve a volume of treated wastewater of 40% in 2016 • Treat wastewater up to the tertiary level and reuse it at 50% in 2020. Since the implementation of the NAP current situation is characterized as follows: • Increase in the rate of connection to the wastewater network to 75% (against 70% in 2005); • Increase in the wastewater treatment rate to 340.47 Mm3 per year, i.e. 45 overall compared to 8% in 2005, of which 23% of the overall volume handled at the tertiary level; • Completion of 140 WWTPs (compared to 21 in 2005) including 55 with tertiary treatment; • 8 4 STEPs in progress; • A biogas energy recovery project (anaerobic treatment) of WWTPs at a rate of 40% to the 2030 horizon. All waste sector projects reduce cumulative emissions avoided between 2020 and 2030 by 35,226 from the baseline for the same period. These projects would also help to mitigate emissions of the year 2030 of 4,194 To accelerate energy and material recovery from waste set up in 2018 achieve a 50% recycling rate and 25% recycling of industrial waste by 2030. The Department of the Environment has also launched work to update the legislative framework relating to waste, in particular Law 28 00 waste at source; establish a selective waste collection system; ensure the promotion of waste recovery techniques and the integration of the principle of extended responsibility of the producer; and environmentally friendly management of hazardous waste. 4.7.2. Sector vision statement In the vision of a development strategy with low greenhouse gas emissions on the horizon 2050 recycling of waste and as one of the most competitive and most carbon-free economies attractions in the region. This vision of the waste sector is based on three strategic axes: • Make the circular economy a citizen project environmental • Create an integrated waste ecosystem existing waste recovery channels and the integration of high-intensity international channels potential; • Link Morocco to the European Green Deal and meet new environmental standards international markets through a decarbonization of the Moroccan economy. The circular economy is a key project for sustainable waste management the horizons of the social and solidarity economy advocated by Morocco projects responding to needs that are not fully covered by companies conventional. It is a source of social innovation and employment opportunities for the most vulnerable. It is a question of mobilizing the regions around meaningful projects, in particular for the local population. Successful transition to a circular economy of the State both to define an economic framework in favor of waste recovery and to create the conditions for the collection of almost all recyclable waste. It also passes by structuring the production sectors in order to integrate the concept of eco-design and promote innovation (ongoing as part of the Green Ecosystem). This transition to a circular economy must be fair and inclusive through statutory integration informal agents across the entire value chain (collection transformation of the perception of the concept of waste by introducing the concepts of economics circular throughout the educational and cultural fields of the Kingdom. 4.7.3. Questions and queries The transition to a circular economy regional potential environmental different regions. Thereby answers to the following key questions and prerequisites: • How to set up a unified governance system circular and green economy which reconciles the specific prerogatives of local authorities in waste management and the powers of the central ministries in charge of the economy green (e.g. Ministry of Industry and Green and Digital Economy Ministry of Energy and Mines • What normative framework international eco-environmental imperatives? • How to think of innovative financing mechanisms scale and micro-projects for recovery and recycling? • How to make the recovery and recycling industry competitive by focusing on economies of scale and a policy of substitution industrialization? • Should R&D and innovation be positioned as a competitive lever for the circular economy? in the private sector 4.7.4. From vision to strategy: proposals for work on the waste sector • Establish an indicative long-term roadmap for strengthening the role of the economy circular and green ecosystems as decarbonization measures: ◆ in particular waste sector with a systemic vision; ◆ identify the main indicators of a system for monitoring and evaluating the progress made. This system must be responsive allowing frequent readjustment of measures and actions. • Integrate the role of territories circular economy potential populations and the means to remedy them; et54 Long Term Low Carbon Strategy • Establish a Research and Development roadmap associated with green industrial sectors identified in the long-term circular economy roadmap. 4.8. Integration of sectoral issues: identification of key nexuses for development low-carbon Morocco 4.8.1. Water desalination and renewable energies To meet the challenges of increasing water demand for drinking water needs and for agricultural use climatic of its national water resources mobilization policy. In this context purified have been retained as long-term strategic choices of its National Program of drinking water supply and irrigation 2020-2027 and the National Water Plan (PNE) by 2020-2050. For this purpose water that require: • Seawater desalination projects to produce nearly 1 billion m3/year in order to secure drinking water in the cities of Casablanca consolidate the irrigation of the Chtouka and Dakhla perimeters. This technology is very consuming energy which constitutes up to 60% of the operating cost of desalination plants. It is estimated the electricity needs of new seawater desalination projects by 2050 to about 3 000 GWh / an (14); • Interconnection projects envisaged over long distances to mitigate the water deficit in the level of the Moulouya basins We deduce that the production of drinking water will henceforth be intrinsically dependent on the energy sector. This dependence will increase with the commissioning of new projects supply of the city of Marrakech from the Al Massira dam (+1000 m of discharge) from the city of Meknes from the Idriss I dam (+680m) Rabat-Casablanca Guelmim and other Saharan cities. These projects advantageously integrated into the National Energy Strategy of the country and particularly into the renewable energy program. Water and energy management based on an interdependent approach should therefore be suitable for seeking solutions based on an integrated assessment of challenges and linkages opportunities offered by the two Water and Energy sectors. A governance approach to natural resources based on the interdependence between the different resources complex effective and promote economic and social development. In conclusion renewable energies for carbon-free electricity contribute to the implementation of the new CWP and ensure the country's water security • Increasing the energy efficiency of water treatment and transport facilities; • The planning of integrated projects (energy and hydraulics) to optimize consumption energy; • The coupling of energy-consuming projects with renewable energy sources as much as possible • Improving the performance of hydroelectric plants; • Saving water and energy through water demand management; • Examination of the possibilities of using dam reservoirs for the development of parks floating photovoltaic solar panels; and (14) Based on an average consumption of 2 N. Voutchkov • The readjustment of the regulatory and institutional framework to take into account the specificities of the water sector and above all make available to this sector reduced energy tariffs. 4.8.2. Territory Development The deployment of a long-term low-carbon development strategy must be based on a coherent land use plan urban systems and transport networks. This layout plan is particularly impacting energy consumption and GHG emissions in the building and transports. In the first place will order the solutions carbon. It will also have a strong impact on the distribution between collective and individual housing. The location of activities and in particular of tertiary premises growing number of jobs commuter dailies. So that transport flows are controlled in an integrated logic "transport - land use" and this at different territorial scales. It is a condition for their full place in “active” and “collective” modes An example of an integrated approach is given in the functional diagram of the TRANUS model. Activities Transport Location and Demand for transport interaction between Transport  services activities demand Equilibrium Equilibrium Real Estate  Physical and operative supply Accessibility and  transport supply transport costs Source : CEREMA 4.8.3. Industry The consideration of a life cycle perspective for consumption-emissions should allow to identify traditional techniques and materials than industrialized models. The balances found between these different solutions will have important consequences for the materials and for those producing building components and equipment. Similarly times on the industries of structural materials for infrastructures (steel manufacturing industries for assembly zero emissions (electric Whether in construction or transport development of adapted solutions time can be presented as a 3R approach: Reduce-Reuse-Recycle.56 Long-Term Low Carbon Strategy CIRCULAR ECONOMY 3 domains Source: ADEME. This is a condition for jointly managing several problems: that of waste availability of raw materials energy and water consumption. This perspective can be based on the concepts of “the economy functionality » the environment than a photocopier the circular economy or functionality calls for a massive training effort at all levels of the education system. It will be important to encourage national industries in relation to the production of materials energy efficient as well as for the production of building materials in general in view of potential benefits in terms of costs and decarbonization (reduction of costs imports as well as GHG generated by the transport of these materials). 4.8.4. Carbon-free energy system Given the climate emergency major in all countries. Efforts in this direction also come up against the very great inertia of technical systems based on heavy equipment and infrastructure. It takes a little time (by 2050) both ensure adequate coverage of household energy needs and the economy and achieve a complete technological transition to low-cost solutions carbon. But these solutions are not that numerous. Once demand is under control new renewable energies (wind and solar) conventional renewables (hydraulic and biomass) fossils associated with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Each has strengths and costs or disadvantages of different and very specific natures. Almost complete decarbonization energy in 2050 will result from a mix of these options. It is a very political choice which goes beyond largely the only economic dimension.Morocco 2050 57 Today coal in particular variable renewable energies new energy solutions also open up other perspectives for the organization of energy systems since they can be operated both as power plants renewables connected to the distribution transport network and in a decentralized form application to local needs with stand-alone or grid-connected system. It is in this perspective on the one hand of deployment of a decentralized offer and fine management of consumption that digital technologies can profoundly impact the architecture of future energy systems through smart grids SMART GRID Nuclear Power Plant Factories Thermal Power Plant Electric Vehicle Control Center City & Building Wind Power Plant Smart Houses Solar Power Plant Source: ADEME. These networks are indeed a key dimension for a massive insertion of energy intermittent in electrical systems large networks with different geographical meshes local in “virtual power stations” consumption of electricity. The smart grid concept is not limited to electricity. he can also be applied for combined management decarbonized vectors 4.8.5. Food The term nexus – a complex set of interconnected objects – is particularly suited to describe the food-agriculture-forest issue. In a simplified way basic human need often in competition in particular forestry.58 Long-Term Low Carbon Strategy The conditions for the development of an essential economic sector depend on the choice of consumers in terms of food as well as the maintenance of a set of ecosystems ensuring carbon storage food – between cereals will have very different impacts on the mobilization of multiple resources: land workforce commercial (advertising) that determine food preferences. Policies in this area cannot be authoritarian and must rather be based on a information and clear communication. Their development requires the construction of integrated scenarios ensuring consistency of needs 4.8.6. Meeting basic needs The issue of meeting basic needs the least privileged of the population limitation of waste and overconsumption. For an emerging country like Morocco the population a good level of satisfaction of basic needs: food energy and water inclusive policies for controlling the prices of basic products and services and for infrastructure development associated with these basic needs. But to respect global and local environmental constraints high-impact consumption in terms of housing equipment consumption. These consumptions often have a strong mimetic or demonstration dimension. social of a sustainable development model several critical consumer areas. Authoritarian solutions – banning certain products – are probably not the most socially acceptable becomes an element that is considered in some countries. Similarly environmental externalities can be an important dimension of sobriety policies and efficiency in the use of energy 4.8.7. Consumption Beyond changes in consumption patterns towards less impactful profiles It is to be expected that a low-carbon development strategy will lead to new macroeconomic balances. Specifically fossil fuels through the implementation of an investment in energy efficiency or mobilization of renewable energies leads to a new consumption/investment balance throughout the economy. Firstly transition. The financial and banking sector must be ready to provide businesses and households solutions tailored to their needs. In the field of energy or “third party financing” formulas recurring savings achieved by each project. On the other hand full initial investment. It is possible in many cases technically profitable but unrealized investments transaction or information. But it is possible that in the transition in technical and economic terms must be implemented. They would then weigh on the household consumption with a risk of loss of activity and employment in the affected sectors. To what extent and how can these lost jobs be compensated by jobs created in ecological transition activities of the New Climate Economy. Macroeconomic models can shed light on the nature of these new macro balances.Morocco 2050 59 4.8.8. Industrial strategy The new macroeconomic balances of a long-term low-emission development scenario term reflect the characteristics of a real economy Entire branches of industry will have to abandon old product lines and develop new lines on the contrary: the case of the automotive industry is undoubtedly emblematic of this necessary transformation. In this transformation difficult to apply. This is because the innovations and their potential for dissemination are not still all identified for example to possible competition hydrogen. It is clear, however, that from an international perspective maintaining established solutions which will be driving strategic orientations of the public authorities must in this case be clear shared by as many stakeholders as possible. It is undoubtedly in this way that industrial strategies can be developed. efficient equipment needed for the transition. But it is also possible that these new activities are the key to a good international insertion in markets where one may wish that they will experience strong growth in the coming years. One last dimension long-term low-emission development is that of employment and vocational training. Certain industrial branches will be able to carry out conversions “from brown to green” in their own breast. But this will not be the case for all. Here again, clear and explicit guidelines from public authorities will enable companies and training systems to anticipate and ensure the continuity of professional trajectories.60 Long-Term Low Carbon Strategy 5. Cross-cutting issues of low-carbon development from Morocco 5.1. Central place of regions and cities According to the High Commission for Planning (HCP) 2014 and should reach 68% around 2030 and 73 National growth is driven by 9 metropolises. Currently Cities generate more than 80% of global GDP and are responsible for around 3/4 of emissions global carbon dioxide low carbon. In Morocco institutional logics citizens Thereby undeniably the involvement and the mobilization and setting in motion of all the actors; since the smallest rural community to various state authorities each associative and private sector actor In this process advanced regionalization municipalities Sustainable development national measures and decisions and more broadly of the global framework of the fight against climate change climatic. The involvement of territorial entities treat On the other hand medium-term low-carbon development. Several initiatives have been launched by cities and regions of Morocco over the past five years • Launch of work to draw up Territorial Climate Plans for 7 regions in addition to those of the Marrakech-Safi and Souss-Massa regions; • Programming of several RE and EE projects in all regional development programs (PDR) drawn up for the period 2016-2021; • Climat Med project to support 11 Moroccan cities in the development of plans of action for access to sustainable energy and the climate;Morocco 2050 61 • CoMun project which has made it possible to improve energy and environmental performance and governance of municipalities; • Launch of the new phase of the national liquid sanitation program (PNA) and the national household waste program (PNDM) focused on energy and material recovery; • Adoption by the Waste Recovery Coalition (COVAD) of a roadmap for the implementation of place of industrial sectors based on the management of material flows; • New vision of sustainable development of urban and inter-city transport; • Launch of Lighting Development Master Plans (SDAL) in several cities; • Subnational Climate Finance Expertise Program (PEFCLI) for regional development and municipalities of climate mitigation and adaptation projects inside • Climate Finance Program launched by the Municipal Equipment Fund (FEC) for the benefit of local authorities territorial. To accelerate the goal of decarbonization and recovery from COVID-19 published in March 2021 national governments to invest in cities taking into account the climate emergency and the imperative of shared prosperity In the six countries studied (China implementation of identified solutions could collectively reduce annual emissions in cities by 87-96% by 2050 beyond countries' initial commitments under the NDCs. This massive decarbonization of cities could generate climate benefits these advantages and act on 6 strategic levers Thereby term • Develop a vision and long-term low-carbon transformation objectives at the level national and also at regional and local level to show the way; • Rely on the 3 Drivers of transformation: 1 Decarbonization 2 Decentralization and convergence sectoral policies at the territorial level and 3 Digitization; • Develop integrated operational measures the temperature increase below to 1 • Develop regional and local energy strategies and investment plans aimed at long-term low-carbon development by 2050 and ultimately aiming for carbon neutrality; • Align the planning and development tools of the regions (SRAT and PDR) and cities and municipalities (SDAU and PAC) to low-emission development objectives and investments of GHGs by 2050; •  To contribute the national NDC and the achievement of the objectives of the LT-LEDS by 2050; • Limit the impact of the climate on the territory by reducing socio-economic vulnerability and strengthening the resilience of natural ecosystems; • Develop a national strategy for direct access of local authorities to funds climate finance organizations; • Study the feasibility of designing and implementing a dedicated national carbon fund/market to cities; • Accelerate the implementation of the rules of the national green tax system and in particular at the level regions and cities: • Consolidation of national expertise for the benefit of the energy transition of regions and cities of the Kingdom. 5.2. Governance Morocco's determination to make climate change a national priority was confirmed in highest level of the state. This determination is illustrated in particular through the strengthening of the Institutional frame. Morocco has set up several structures to take charge of the aspects cross-cutting aspects of climate change as well as a panoply of institutions and councils that serve as a framework for consultation and a place for the participation of all stakeholders in decision-making climate decision. The complexity of the climate change governance system in Morocco integrating decarbonization into its long-term development model part by its cross-cutting and cross-sectoral nature decision-making process at the central level consumer sector level. The central government coordinates all policy country's climate and energy Since then climatic rigorous and progressive regulation long-term carbon. In effect on the increased use of renewable energies intensified demand Economic and Social The governance of the transition to long-term low-carbon development should adapt future developments in key energy sectors habitat local authorities set up as part of the strategic project of “Regionalization advanced " and cities of Morocco. It will require a reconfiguration of design processes public policies to guarantee a structured and regulated integration of development long-term low carbon in several related policies silos rely on the following action levers: • Create a multi-stakeholder and multi-scale dialogue platform: State the deployment of the low-carbon development strategy; • Redesign design processes with a view to guaranteeing structured and regulated integration of low-carbon development in term in several related policies regional and local; • Use the opportunities presented by climate and sustainable finance. For it provide a long-term fundraising strategy domestic and international resources climate marketing of energy projects developed by Moroccan regions and cities; At the level of territorial governance bodies training and institutional capacity development program elected officials and executives of the administration of regions and cities climate change adaptation and mitigation measures in strategic planning territory and on the technical and financial set-up of climate projects. Besides are called upon to ensure: • Strengthening the financial and technical management capacities of the administration of the regions and cities to be able to raise funds internationally and in particular those for climate finance necessarily resort to the guarantee of the state. The two successful experiences in the region of Casablanca-Settat and the Greater Casablanca Metropolis in terms of mobilizing significant funding from the World Bank to develop their transport infrastructure and mobility can be a model to follow; • The mobilization and support of the private sector at the regional level in adaptation projects and mitigation of the effects of climate change; • The promotion of innovative options for mobilizing international climate finance and public-private partnership (PPP). The transition of the energy sector must also rely primarily on the private sector, which will have to make the necessary investments for the energy transition initiator and facilitator. On the other hand the continuity of service and electricity costs for industrial users (imperative to competitiveness) of their decarbonization. For this purpose the transition to long-term low-carbon development durable the green and circular economy within a framework of institutionalized and participatory dialogue. As such Higher National Council for “Energy Transition” representatives of associations of local authorities civil society implementation of the proposed strategic orientations. Many experiences in this domain exist in other countries transparent and efficient transition. The success of Morocco's energy transition also requires a responsive and responsive monitoring and evaluation system. allowing frequent readjustment of measures and actions. In this direction energy (OME) should guarantee wider access to information and the means of scientific production and make available to public and private decision-makers the key elements for decision-making and socio-economic impact assessment of policies and measures before their adoption. 5.3. Finance A national banking and financial sector committed to integrating climate risks into its non-financial management and communication rules The main international private banks and financial institutions have recently posted commitments to align their portfolios and internal credit granting processes with the net objective zero emissions by 2050. As supervisory authorities of the financial system central and supervisory authorities have begun to introduce explicit strategies to support the transition to net zero to address the risks of climate change. Their objective is twofold: first, minimize the risks of climate change for the stability of the financial system and the macroeconomics; and second that their activities are consistent with the climate policies of Governments and including low greenhouse gas emission development strategies. To anticipate this profound transformation of the global financial sector Morocco's ambitious climate policy national bank have developed since 2016 Moroccan financial sector on sustainable development which green finance at the regional and continental level and the positioning of the financial center of casablanca know the extension of governance to socio-environmental risk factors (ESG) development of sustainable financial instruments and products capacity building in the field of sustainable finance and transparency and discipline Steps. On the other hand guidelines for the development of green and sustainable bonds.Morocco 2050 65 In March 2021 relating to the system for managing financial risks linked to climate change and the environment. This guideline is based on international principles and best practices enacted in terms of green finance financial sector greening centrals and supervisors (NGFS) and the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). She applies to credit institutions and similar organizations for risk management finance related to climate change and the environment. For this purpose apprehend and understand the financial risks to which the institution may be exposed to court he must in particular: • Define the strategic orientations of the institution taking into account the integration of factors environmental and climatic; • Approve the strategy and policy on financial risks related to climate change and the environment; • Promote the understanding and assessment of the nature and level of exposure of the establishment to said risks with regard to the institution’s risk appetite. Institutions are working to develop analytical tools and stress tests climate change short The committee responsible for monitoring the risk identification and management process for each credit institution the development of the financial risk management policy related to climate change and the the environment and ensures its monitoring and evaluation. Institutions publish their practices and performance in managing financial risks related to the environment in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure on an annual basis at least. Institutions send Bank Al-Maghrib a report periodical on the management of financial risks related to climate change and the environment which integrates qualitative and quantitative information exposure of the institution to said risks. The implementation of this new system requires the availability and accessibility of data on the climate and environmental vulnerabilities and footprints of sectors and products and strong collaboration between public data production institutions financial sector boards. This new directive thus envisages reconfiguring the risk management model the national financial sector and guide the processes and financing flows towards low GHG economic and social development long-term. In view of this strong commitment crucial in future phases of LEDS development • The development by Banque Al Maghrib of long-term prospective scenarios that are consistent with the objectives defined in this document of the LT-LEDS at Horizon Morocco 2050 adequately taking into account the impacts of these scenarios on the macroeconomic results; • Sustainable and responsible investment practices for bank portfolios should include a goal of alignment with this LT-LEDS and each publish a plan for just transition to get there. Morocco has also developed continental leadership in climate finance. Nowadays 9 national projects and programs have been approved by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) total funding of around 227 Today the GCF: the Agency for Agricultural Development that other entities are in the process of being accredited Bank of Afica…66 Long Term Low Carbon Strategy Nevertheless long term are numerous and diverse. Among the most important • The real costs of the initial investments are high and are confronted with a low propensity to pay for own investments; • The low financial attractiveness of new low-carbon solutions investment and much less on its viability over the life of the project; • The low exploitation of the potential of international climate finance due to a multitude of factors: ignorance of the different sources of financing for climate action and limited stakeholder engagement the difficulty of complying with the requirements sources of financing and structuring eligible projects; • The valuation of co-benefits taken into account ; • Transaction costs for project delivery are still high; • Direct and indirect subsidies likely to discourage innovative solutions. The thresholds of financial profitability often remain unattractive; and • Learning curves are slow and do not allow the rapid expansion of markets. Thus and in view of the significant financing needs of a low-level development strategy carbon in the long term and given the opportunities presented by climate and sustainable finance Morocco should adopt a long-term financing mobilization strategy diversification of domestic and international resources financial climate international donors and building project implementation capacity. This comprehensive long-term low-carbon development finance strategy should be designed within a framework of public policies that are gradually aligned with the challenge of low carbon transition: • Take climate change and low-carbon development into account in policies macroeconomic public investments and procurement practices; • Initiate a profound change in the modalities of the public investment budget and functioning adaptation in the special requirements specifications (CPS) for public procurement annual “performance project” reporting by ministerial departments; • Develop a carbon market through effective carbon pricing measures by capitalizing on the tools for implementing the NDC; • Mobilize new private sources of international climate finance green bond market • Promote the development of a national banking and financial sector that integrates risks climate change and mitigation and adaptation measures in its risk management system. risks and in its business processes and financial products; • Establish a national taxonomy of green and sustainable activities experience of the European approach in this area to (i) understand climate and environmental risks and opportunities (ii) reduce transaction costs related to green projects and facilitate the structuring of eligible projects and (iii) improve and harmonize the communication of quantified information on exposure to climate risks and mitigation the environmental footprint; • Strengthen the expertise of national financial and banking operators in the assessment and climate and environmental risk management successfully implement the new directive No. 5/W/2021 of Bank Al-Maghrib relating to the system for managing financial risks linked to climate change and the environment; Morocco 2050 67 • Support collaboration and dialogue between financial regulators and ministerial authorities concerned to produce and make accessible scientific data related to the carbon footprint and climate risks related to economic sectors and also to ensure the development and the resilience of the green financial market; and • Design a green tax system and adjust energy pricing to accelerate the energy transition of the national economy related redistribution. 5.4. Other cross-cutting issues: digital transition To succeed in this energy transition and seize all the opportunities it offers around many promising themes technological dependence in this sector in Morocco. This involves a strategy of R&D and training of technicians and engineers and mobilization of local innovation capacities sources of energy saving In this context energy companies to rely on digital transformation to adapt quickly to new market trends. The digital transition is a strategic lever for mitigating GHGs and fight against climate change. The carbon footprint of digital transformation is also an important issue that should be mastered and taken into account in the various phases of planning and future technological choices. Digital transformation is about to disrupt energy models habitat consumers sectors • Activities directly linked to the industrial tool smart) contribute to mastering the management of renewable electricity production and distribution; • Digital counters use of innovative risk hedging tools (trading room); and • Customer relations and employee acculturation. This digital evolution of energy models requires agility from the various actors and sectors (electricity production and distribution and agriculture) to rethink their activities by proposing a new value chain that intervenes from energy production to distribution Big data innovative (cleantech On the other hand energy transition should: • Design and implement professional training programs market needs current energy efficient; • Develop and distribute appropriate training equipment and tools: training materials formation • Ensure the availability of qualified instructors and carry out “training of trainers”; • Develop continuing education to enable periodic updating of knowledge and expertise in energy efficiency and renewable energies. In addition to professional and permanent training introduce the notions of energy efficiency in school programs for children. Educational measures targeting children aged school and young people will improve their knowledge energy and food consumption in the future.68 Long-Term Low Carbon Strategy Annex: List of institutions and actors consulted Ministerial Departments: • Ministry of National Territorial Planning the city • Ministry of the Interior • Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development • Ministry of Economy and Finance • Ministry of Equipment and Water • Ministry of Transport and Logistics • Ministry of Industry and Commerce • The Minister of Agriculture • Ministry Delegate to the Head of Government in charge of the Digital Transition and Administrative reform Civil society: Moroccan Alliance for Climate and Sustainable Development (AMCDD) Local authorities: • Association of Regions of Morocco (ARM) • Moroccan Association of Presidents of Municipal Councils (AMPCC) Establishments and public enterprises: • National Agency for the Development of Argan Oasis Zones (ANDZOA) • Forest Research Center • National Agency for Public Facilities (ANEP) • OCP Group • ONEE-Electricity Branch and Water Branch • Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) • Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency (AMEE) • Energy Engineering Society (SIE) • Institute for Research in Solar Energy and New Energies (IRESEN) • CDG Development • AL OMRANE Group • National Railways Office (ONCF) • Agency for Agricultural Development (ADA) • Hassan II Agronomic and Veterinary Institute (IAV Hassan II) • National Institute for Agronomic Research (INRA)Morocco 2050 69 National private and financial sector: • General Confederation of Moroccan Enterprises (CGEM) • National Electricity Federation • Association of Solar and Wind Industries (AMISOLE) • National Federation of Property Developers (FNPI) • National Transport and Logistics Federation (FNTL) • Professional Association of Cement Manufacturers (APC) • Moroccan Confederation of Agriculture and Rural Development (COMADER) • National Agrifood Federation (FENAGRI) • LAFARGE-HOLCIM Group • Moroccan Agricultural Insurance Mutual and Moroccan Central Insurance Mutual (MAMDA et MCMA) • Bank Al Maghrib (BAM) • Credit Agricole du Maroc (CAM) • Moroccan Capital Market Authority (AMMC) • Insurance and Social Welfare Supervisory Authority (ACAPS) • Casablanca Finance City Authority (CFCA) • Casablanca Stock Exchange • Professional Association of Banks of Morocco (GPBM) • Moroccan Federation of Insurance and Reinsurance Companies (FMSAR)70 Long-Term Low Carbon Strategy Bibliography Special Commission on the Development Model (CSMD) development model: “Release energies and restore confidence to accelerate the march towards progress and prosperity for all” World Bank (2019) Readiness (P128654).
