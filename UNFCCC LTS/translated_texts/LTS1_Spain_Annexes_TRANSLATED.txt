This hypothesis is conservative since after decades of converting other categories in forest land Currently there are hardly any changes in land use in this sense. ▶ Conversions of cropland and grassland to other categories are estimated at median levels of 1,000 ha/year (compared to 25,000 ha/year on average 1990-2016) considering a conservative hypothesis based on the national agricultural policies. Agricultural activities continue to have great social importance territorial and that induce to propose a maintenance of the agricultural area. ▶ Wetland and other land categories remain stable. 8ANNEX A. NATURAL SINKS A.2.2 Factors influencing emissions and removals In the LULUCF sector, the influence of removals dominates in the forest land category. The forests Spaniards are an example of protection and restoration of forest heritage recovering in area and increasing the CO storage continuously since the 19th century after a historic period of deforestation caused by 2 different socioeconomic circumstances. These forests have been shown to be a persistent carbon sink projected to continue for decades. No however signs of saturation are already observed has projected for the period 2018-2050 considering the following causes: Impacts of climate change on the national forestry sector The effects of climate change on forest ecosystems in Spain are already evident in many aspects: changes in the distribution of arboreal and supra-arboreal forest formations structural modifications and functional alterations in certain parameters of forest health weather and fire change in the flow of environmental goods and services provided by forests The impacts that are projected according to future climate scenarios of them as the 21st century progresses (see ANNEX B. ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE). The analysis of the projections of the limiting climatic factors that determine the territorial distribution of the species plants in the national territory predicts a general reduction of the climatically suitable surface for almost all the taxa analyzed throughout this century. This reduction is especially worrying in the case of formations forests such as Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo) silver fir (Abies alba) sessile (Quercus petraea) and cork oak (Quercus suber) and significantly affects 20% of forest species2. forest management The sustainable management of forests is essential to guarantee their persistence. exist various instruments such as planning projects that allow owners to plan and schedule properly the work to be carried out in their mountains so that a return can be obtained from them at the same time regeneration is guaranteed. At the moment the ordered surface rate (i.e. its forest management) with respect to the total forest is 17%3. Unmanaged forest area represents a loss of opportunities for the use of wood products defense against forest fires and management focused on the species most adapted to climate change forecasts. All these aspects would have a direct influence on the balance of COeq absorptions and emissions reflected in the 2 National Inventory of Greenhouse Gases. 1 Hits vulnerability and adaptation to climate change of Spanish biodiversity. 1.

The combination of elements and processes such as aridity the drought origin of the different landscapes or typical scenarios of desertification in our territory. On the other hand projections on climate change in Spain point to increasing aridity and rising temperatures namely scenarios more prone to desertification processes (see ANNEX B. ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE). The update of the desertification risk maps4 shows a projection of an increase mainly due to the evolution of aridity and erosion due to climate change. Even though there were no increases quantitatively important soil loss the predicted increase in aridity points to an increase in risk of desertification. 4 Impacts of climate change on desertification processes in Spain.

A.2.3 Projections to 2050 Taking into account what was outlined in the previous points (trends in land use land use changes and factors influencing emissions and removals from the LULUCF sector) a trend scenario is estimated in which the total absorptions are in 2050 of 23 6 MtCOeq vs. 38 2 2 from 38 4%.

NATURAL SINKS A.3 CLIMATE NEUTRALITY SCENARIO A.3.1 Sink enhancement opportunities The management of the land categories that comprise the LULUCF sector especially of forest lands is Comparison to other sectors and technologies for greenhouse gas removals relatively easy to manage with policies and measures aimed at increasing net absorptions additionally generating environmental co-benefits and socioeconomic To that effect The following measures and opportunities are identified to improve natural sinks: Creation of wooded forest areas Forests play a central role in the global carbon cycle because they capture it from the atmosphere as They grow and store it in their tissues. Due to its enormous biomass Forests are one of the largest carbon sinks. in addition generate goods and services of great importance to society (biodiversity protection of the hydrological cycle Based on the analysis carried out in the planning of the forestry sector5, it is estimated that there is still land potential susceptible to reforestation in Spain. Thus in the target scenario of the LULUCF sector (which is the Scenario of Climate Neutrality) a reforestation rate of 20,000 ha/year is proposed in the period 2020-2050 (increase from 0 6 Mha throughout the period projected in 2050 in the baseline scenario) increasing the forest sink by 7 2 net in 2050 with respect to the trend. One of the objectives of sustainable management in neglected forests is the reduction of the competition improvement of individual tree vigor specific anticipation and maximization of production at the end of the shift of biotic and abiotic damage and increase in the value and dimensions of the products taken advantage of. Promotion of sustainable forest management The introduction of sustainable management in neglected forests has among its objectives the reduction of competition improvement of individual tree vigor regulation of the specific composition end of shift production prevention of biotic and abiotic damage used products. All of these effects have a positive impact on CO absorptions. 2 Taking into account the potential for improvement in the management of the existing forest area (approximately 12 Mha of wooded forest area without management plan) a management objective of 100,000 ha/year is established to an additional 3 Mha ordered in 2050. Considering the combined effect of this measure due to higher growth to future the reduction of fire risk and the use of forest products 4 34 MtCO eq of net absorptions in 2050 compared to the trend scenario. 2 5 Spanish Forest Plan.

NATURAL SINKS wetland restoration During the 20th century, it is estimated that 60% of the original area of wetlands in Spanish territory was destroyed (about 1 Mha) mainly due to changes in land use (conversion of wetlands to agricultural crops). What's more many of the wetlands that have remained present severe alterations due to salt extractions alterations of the hydrological regime and hydroperiods drains overgrazing There are numerous studies at European and national level6 that relate the annual carbon balances with the types subtypes and conservation status of wetlands. Taking into account their restoration potential is feasible to establish a restoration potential of 50,000 ha by 2050 obtaining net absorptions of 1 MtCO eq in 2050 compared to the baseline scenario. 2 Promotion of agroforestry systems and regeneration of dehesas Agroforestry systems integrate woody plants in specialized crop and livestock systems what can translate into concrete environmental and economic benefits at the farm level. In Spain the meadows can be considered a particular case of agroforestry are currently one of the main assets environmental and productive combining grazing with the maintenance of forest trees have by definition The potential of this measure derives on the one hand purely herbaceous uses and densification and ensuring its regeneration. It is about tackling the problem of the perpetuation of these systems due to causes such as overgrazing the shortening of shifts forest fires or the incidence in recent years decays that colloquially fall under the denomination of dry. The potential of agroforestry is estimated to be enormous although conservative figures are proposed: conversion from 0 Mha from arable crops to agroforestry systems and densification from 0 5 Mha of pastures by 2050 net absorption potential of 0 54 MtCOeq by 2050 compared to the baseline scenario. 2 It is important to point out that the deposit of soil organic carbon in agroforestry systems can be seen increased between 20%-80%. Nevertheless There is still no robust methodology to reflect these increases in the National Inventory of Greenhouse Gases therefore, this deposit has not been taken into account. Despite having limited mitigation potential This measure represents an important step to promote mechanisms effective adaptation to climate change and other environmental and socioeconomic synergies. Increase in soil organic carbon Soils in Spain generally have a low organic carbon content in agricultural areas being likely to increase the same through agricultural practices directed to that end. Incentives such as the so-called 4x1000 have explored those alternatives being its application in incipient phases that will have to be encouraged. 6 Morant Studies Camacho et al. 13ANNEX A.

NATURAL SINKS Achieving the level of absorptions calculated in the Climate Neutrality Scenario requires fundamental changes and the involvement and participation of all the actors. Some of the measures such as forest management foresight to generate emission savings and maintain ecological functions. The key points are: ▶ Development of instruments to balance the income of landowners that generate absorptions. ▶ Promotion of research activities development and innovation focused on improving knowledge of ecosystems and the functioning of CO stores. 2 ▶ Transmission of knowledge application of best practices and associationism. ▶ Behavior change among consumers and the supply chain and promoting the use of products forestry. 15ANEXO B ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE 16ANNEX B. ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE Climate change is already a reality that causes impacts and poses risks to which it is necessary to respond. Despite of planned efforts to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions outlined in this strategy the crisis of the climate will continue to progress due to the effect of greenhouse gases already emitted. It's crucial in consecuense make adaptation a strategic axis of public policies. The so-called generically “adaptive responses” are aimed at avoiding or limiting present and future damage derived from climate change and to build a more resilient economy and society. A long-term vision that integrates effective responses to the climate crisis must incorporate an adaptive dimension integrated in a consistent way a component of the ecological transition process. As the IPCC has highlighted in its assessment reports Spain is located in a region of the planet that is highly vulnerable. The European Environment Agency in its latest report on the impacts and vulnerability to climate change climate in Europe7 stresses that its distribution is uneven at European level as those that accumulate a greater number of potential impacts. In this same sense a recent study by the European Commission8 has estimated the impacts in economic terms of climate change in agriculture energy and labor productivity coastal flooding and additional mortality from heat waves. The added economic impact in a scene of intense climate change it would be 8 times greater in the countries of southern Europe than in those of the north. figure that would be reduced by 4 times if the global rise in the mean temperature of the atmosphere were 2°C.

ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE B.1 CLIMATE CHANGE A PHYSICAL REALITY IN SPAIN In Spain, the effects derived from climate change are already being unequivocally noted: ▶ The average temperature has risen 1 5°C in the last 50 years global and the European average. This rise in temperature is more intense in the summer; in fact this station is is lengthening in Spain about 9 days per decade so that It lasts almost five weeks longer today than it did in the early 1980s. ▶ Global warming is also clearly felt in the surface temperature of the water in our seas. In the case of the Mediterranean has been about 0 Warmer Mediterranean causes at the same time minimum temperatures of more than 20°C). ▶ The global volume of precipitation has slightly decreased but changes are taking place significant in its annual distribution with a tendency to advance the spring rains and reduce the summer rains. ▶ Due to increased heat which in turn increases evapotranspiration average flows have been reduced in recent decades11. ▶ Extreme events such as heat waves or droughts According to recent estimates by the European Environment Agency extreme events related to weather and climate have caused direct economic losses in Spain of more than €37,000 million since 198012. According to recent estimates by the European Environment Agency the events extremes related to weather and climate have caused in Spain losses direct economic activities of more than €37,000 million since 1980. B.1.1 Regionalized climate forecasts The regionalized projections for Spain made from the climate models used in the Fifth Report of the IPCC13 outline trends for the future ▶ Maximum and minimum temperatures show a progressive increase throughout the 21st century major in summer and for the most emissive scenario. ▶ The maximum and minimum temperatures of summer and autumn show a more intense increase than those of the winter and spring warming being greater in inland and eastern areas than in northern areas peninsular. 10 Calculations made by AEMET from daily records obtained by the CEAM (Center for Environmental Studies of the Mediterranean) from 1982 and 2019. 11 Martinez-Fernandez J. y otros (2013).

FIGURE B. 2 Estimated frequency of meteorological droughts according to scenarios (2041-2070) Source: European Environment Agency B.1.2 Adaptation-mitigation complementarity Adaptation and mitigation constitute complementary responses to climate change: without an adequate mitigation action adaptive capacities will be hopelessly overwhelmed. AND other part an adaptation that is not low carbon would be meaningless effects are to be avoided. An example of the synergies between mitigation and adaptation is that adaptation helps ecosystems remain maintaining its long-term functionality guaranteeing Soil conservation or fire prevention are also good examples. but there are confluences similar in many other fields. 14 CEDEX (2017).

ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE B.2 ADAPTATION POLICY In 2020 Spain has approved its second National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change which is the instrument of basic planning to promote coordinated and coherent action against the effects of climate change in Spain. The PNACC defines objectives criteria to climate change. The second PNACC has been the result of a collective process of analysis and reflection which began with the evaluation depth of the first approved in 2006 As part of the work aimed at drawing up the new plan an evaluation was completed in mid-2019 general of the first PNACC some of whose main conclusions have been the following: ▶ Has provided a set of basic working tools as regionalized projections of scenarios or methodological manuals that facilitate the self-assessment of vulnerabilities and the definition of adaptive responses. ▶ It has served to promote the generation of knowledge regarding impacts and vulnerability giving place directly or indirectly to an important set of studies. ▶ It has contributed to the training and mobilization of social actors through initiatives such as the organization of sectoral seminars coordination and exchange forums and other training activities. The evaluation has also detected pending challenges among which the identification and application of more measures that translate the knowledge and awareness generated into effective adaptation responses as well as the development of a system of indicators that allows monitoring of the effects of adaptation policies. The second National Adaptation Plan is proposed for the period 2021-2030 developing through two programs successive work cycles (PT-1 period 2021-2025 and PT-2 The following figure shows the relationship between the ELP and the PNACC-2.

ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE B.2.1 General principles of Spanish action in matters of adaptation As a result of the accumulated experience and the consideration of recommendations and guidelines set forth in the at international level Spanish action on adaptation is guided by a series of operating principles among which it is worth highlighting: ▶ Integration of adaptation and mitigation policies: both constitute complementary responses to the climate change. It is necessary to take advantage of the synergies between the two strategies promoting solutions that are at once low carbon and resilient to climate change. ▶ Consideration of the social and territorial dimensions of vulnerability to climate change: impacts are unevenly distributed both from a geographical perspective and from a Social. The geographic and social components of vulnerability must be taken into account in the development of diagnoses and in the definition of adaptation measures. ▶ Complementarity of “top-down” and “bottom-up” approaches: The design of the adaptation processes uses in a complementary way and “bottom-up approach”. As the following figure shows the first part of the general towards the particular using climate and socioeconomic scenarios particular to the general identifying vulnerabilities with the participation of key actors. FIGURE B.4 Complementarity of “top-down” and “bottom-up” approaches Top-down approach Global Global forcing factors Environmental Scenarios Policies and socio-economic Adaptation Assessment impacts Vulnerability (Physics) Vulnerability (social) Participatory processes evaluation of future adaptation options Sector capacity assessment adaptive present and future Local Bottom-up approach Past present Future Source: Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge adapted from FINADAPT15 15 Assessing the Adaptative Capacity of the Finnish Environment and Society under Climate Change 2004. 21ANNEX B. ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE ▶ Anticipation and co-benefits: Adaptation is an anticipatory policy that implicitly savings in the future by avoiding potential damage or reducing expenses in future response actions. In this sense Adaptation is a policy with a medium and long-term projection. Nevertheless future problems or needs adaptation tries to produce short-term social and environmental co-benefits. ▶ Integration of scientific-technical and social contributions: The definition of responses in terms of Adaptation must be supported by scientific-technical analyzes but the definition of what the risk levels are acceptable or what are the most advantageous options to reduce the risk among all the technically feasible it has an undeniable social and political component. Both dimensions must interact constructively to achieve socially supported and technically and economically viable decisions. ▶ Joint use of different instruments: as shown in the figure adaptation policies can use a wide set of instruments to avoid or reduce the risks arising from climate change. The use concerted and coordinated of these instruments consistent with socio-environmental contexts more complete and effective adaptation. The figure shows different types of measures and some examples of each. typology. FIGURE B.5 Types of measures for managing climate change risks · Early warning systems Disaster risk management Hazard and vulnerability mapping Infrastructure improvements Reduction of stress factors for ecosystems Ecosystem management · Promotion of ecological connectivity River basin management Territorial planning Incorporation of climatic risks into urban planning and urban planning Declaration of protected areas Architectural and engineering options (built environments) Physical adaptation measures o Technological options structural · Ecological restoration / green infrastructure · Financial incentives Institutional measures Laws and regulations · National programs and policies Technical and vocational education and training Social measures Information and awareness · Promotion of sustainable lifestyles Source: Based on Table SPM1 of the IPCC Fifth Report (Summary for Policymakers Group II) ▶ Intergenerational justice: The level of effort we undertake today in terms of adaptation and mitigation will condition the future impacts of climate change which will fall mainly on future generations. In that sense when assessing adaptation options recognizing girls children and youth the role of stakeholders in current public policies. ▶ Ecosystem approach and nature-based solutions: Adaptive solutions will be inspired and supported in nature and in its functioning looking for environmental benefits resilience associated with solutions consistent with natural processes. 22ANNEX B. ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE ▶ Integration of international commitments: Spanish action on adaptation assumes the fulfillment of the commitments acquired by Spain as a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention Nations on Climate Change (UNFCCC) the Paris Agreement ▶ Coordination: adaptation to climate change is considered at various scales and sectors. Thus coordination between institutions is a decisive factor in defining effective and coherent responses. ▶ Prevention of maladaptation: Actions aimed at adapting to climate change must avoid measures that may be counterproductive from an adaptive perspective that contravene any of the sustainable development goals or that negatively affect mitigation. B.2.2. Strategic adaptation components To achieve adaptive responses sufficient and effective aspects: B.2.2.1 Generation of knowledge Knowledge of impacts vulnerability and adaptation has increased substantially in recent years which facilitates decision making. Nonetheless it is necessary to continue expanding and updating knowledge and continue working on the identification of effective adaptive responses. The sectors that should lead the development of the Policies and measures must participate in the generation of knowledge encouraging self-assessment exercises and co-creation. B.2.2.2 Integration of adaptation in planning and management public Very often adaptation entails rethinking existing policies and measures carry different risks and limitations than the current ones. Avoiding or limiting impacts requires incorporating the dimension adaptive to a broad set of sectoral policies: biodiversity conservation water planning and management farming rural development adaptive criteria but in the future it will be necessary to continue progressing in this line of work. Adaptation to climate change arises at various scales and sectors. Thus the Coordination between institutions is a decisive factor in defining effective responses and consistent. B.2.2.3 Mobilization of social actors Adaptation to climate change can only be understood as a collective response from society as a whole Spanish including companies general. This approach requires that society as a whole actively participate in the different moments of the cycle of adaptation: risk and vulnerability assessment identification and assessment of adaptation options application of the measures and their monitoring and evaluation. At the same time so that the best contributions can be made need to promote information disclosure 23ANNEX B. ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE B.2.2.4 Change monitoring and evaluation The future climate will not be like what has been known in the past. This fact makes it necessary to strengthen monitoring systems; to increase attention to signs and trends whose proper interpretation will allow a better adjustment of the response adaptive. In this sense, Spanish action on adaptation must: Ensuring the necessary stability and reinforcing in your case Build impact indicator systems adaptation and resilience to recognize trends and assess the successes and failures of adaptation policies and measures enabling the knowledge of the differences in status and situation according to gender as well as to know the incidences of the variables that could lead to discrimination based on sex. Recognize the advances in the development of adaptation policies and the pending challenges as well as systematize and apply the knowledge acquired through the assessment of the results of the initiatives developed. B.2.2.5 I+D+i Given the high vulnerability of Spain it is essential to accelerate the development and deployment of R&D&i knowledge and scale technologies to make them more competitive and efficient in the use of resources and adapted to the new environment. It is necessary to develop a solid and innovative ecosystem around climate change because the momentum and development of R&D&i must consolidate the incorporation of advances and scientific knowledge into decision-making policies. For this, it is necessary to make an effort of education and communication to society about the importance of adaptation; only from knowledge can the need to create the appropriate technologies and innovation develop to tackle it. What's more a significant change in the role of public administrations is necessary promoters of the generation and exchange of knowledge inducers of innovation and facilitators of the process of strategic planning for the impacts of climate change on society and business. This Strategy has a specific section dedicated to R&D in which lines of action and issues to be addressed are detailed (see chapter 5 Factors key cross sections). B.2.2.6 Interinstitutional coordination and governance Adaptation policies and measures are defined and applied at various territorial scales and sectoral areas. The adaptation relevant to all of them. being necessary to ensure coherence and effective integration in these two axes territorial and sectoral to ensure consistent and effective responses. Spain actively participates in the main coordination forums on adaptation at the European level and international. It also has specific bodies for the coordination of adaptation policies between the General Administration of the State and the Autonomous Communities as well as specialized forums on related topics with the weather such as floods or fires. The following figure shows the main coordination forums analysis and exchange of good practices in matters adaptation to climate change. 24ANNEX B. ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE FIGURE B.6 Main forums on adaptation to climate change Coordination and exchange forums in adaptation International Europe Spain CMNUCC DG Climate EU CCPCC Adaptation Committee Working Group on Working Group on (Cancun Agreements) Adaptation (WG6) Impacts and Adaptation (GTIA) OECD AEMA Themes Working Group on Group on Impacts and Adaptation Adaptation (EIONET-CC) National Committee of Risk Reduction of G20 Presidency EU Disasters Working group of Group of experts in Permanent Commission of Climate Sustainability Adaptation (EGA) climatic adversities and environmental Spanish group of Floods (GHG) Committee to Fight Forest fires (CLIF) Source: Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge 2020 These stable coordination and information exchange mechanisms need to be strengthened to facilitate more between the various departments or sectoral areas of administrations: by way of example the construction of coherent adaptation policies in terms of water requires achieving close coordination between the policies of planning and management of water and agriculture main economic activity that consumes water resources in Spain. What's more the maintenance of institutional forums for participation in the preparation and monitoring of the climate change adaptation policies in which public administrations and organizations are involved and entities representing social and environmental interests. B.2.2.7 Transparency and accountability As the risks stemming from the climate crisis tend to increase public policies on adaptation take on a growing role. This makes it necessary to ensure transparency knowledge and social control of themselves. Transparent management builds trust and facilitates the evaluation of strategies adaptation plans and programs by society and its representative institutions. Some of the instruments that facilitate the aforementioned rendering of accounts are: ▶ Preparation of regular progress reports in which the progress made and the pending challenges are reported. ▶ Organization of periodic presentations and appearances before the main sovereign bodies: Congress and Senate regional parliaments The main environmental effect of the great introduction of renewables is the reduction of greenhouse gases. However there is another series of environmental effects on factors such as land use natural heritage and biodiversity that may not be positive if preventive environmental measures are not taken adequate corrective and compensatory measures. 25ANNEX B. ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE Thus all actions to implement renewables will be subject to environmental objectives and measures aligned with European policies in this area such as the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030. Special attention will be paid to the cumulative effects of renewable installations in the rural environment promoting specific environmental criteria avoiding the affection to fragile environmental values or of interest for the conservation of the means, medium promoting sustainable and fair rural development forest environments silvopastoriles natural heritage biodiversity and traditional economic activity linked to the territory. B.2.3 Transversal tools Public action on climate change must provide a series of practical tools of a transversal nature that facilitate the analysis of impacts and risks and the definition of adaptive responses. Among them it is worth highlighting: B.2.3.1 Systematic observation and regionalized climate scenarios Recognize trends from observations and glimpse possible features of future scenarios of change climate allows planning responses. Scenarios cannot be conceived as precise predictions of what It will happen but as plausible descriptions of future climate-related situations and their potentials effects. Public action on adaptation must guarantee: ▶ Systematic observation of the key variables of the climate system and meteorological observation for early warning. ▶ Regular updating of climate scenarios starting from the most solvent and current models. ▶ Making it available to all interested persons through suitable and versatile tools Like the stage viewers. ▶ The generation of climate services in collaboration with priority sectors through which the data and basic climate information are transformed into specific products and applications useful for users of the various sectors. ▶ Training of stakeholders so that they can make the best use of tools and data available. Scenarios cannot be conceived as precise predictions of what is going to happen but as plausible descriptions of future climate-related situations and their potential effects. B.2.3.2 Knowledge management platform on adaptation Online portals on adaptation have proven to be an effective tool for making available to any interested person relevant information and useful resources for adaptation. In Spain the platform AdapteCCa16 ha progressively improving its functionalities and expanding its contents. This update and improvement work continues will continue in the future to ensure that the platform contributes to knowledge management. 16 https://www.adaptecca.es/ 26ANNEX B. ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE B.2.4 Sectoral lines of work Adaptation acquires specific meanings and faces diverse challenges in the different sectoral areas of planning and public management. Next Some of the most relevant are highlighted: B.2.4.1 Natural heritage and biodiversity Today same as yesterday that apparently have a higher degree of artificiality. In this way changes are very worrying caused by climate change in the composition the structure and functioning of Spanish ecosystems. By example in marine ecosystems 2 hindering the calcification process carried out by numerous invertebrates; in inland aquatic ecosystems Changes in water temperature and modifications in the composition of the communities and in their productivity; in terrestrial ecosystems, changes in foliation calendars have been confirmed fruiting or falling of the leaves in vegetables or changes in the reproductive calendar animals that tend to move towards higher latitudes or higher altitudes. Among the lines of work aimed at limiting impacts and increasing the resilience of natural systems they will be included: ▶ The reinforcement of policies and measures aimed at conservation: well-preserved and biodiverse ecosystems have greater resilience to climate change. ▶ The promotion of ecological connectivity including the identification and conservation of ecological corridors. ▶ The integration of adaptation in the planning and management of protected areas. Biodiversity forms the basis of the material well-being of human societies even those that apparently have a higher degree of artificiality. B.2.4.2 Water and water resources Projections on the climate crisis point to a progressive decrease in water resources in Spain. In a country that already uses water intensively both rivers and aquifers and manage conflicts of use. The challenge is crucial as If you don't intervene properly be attended to with the available resources, leading us to a structural crisis over water. Adaptation to climate change in water planning and management must address several complementary fronts highlighting: ▶ Drought management (given the tendency for them to be more frequent and longer) with mechanisms that favor flexibility of supply and demand. ▶ Flood management responding to new weather patterns such as faster snow melt or more intense torrential rains or outside the usual times. ▶ Protection of water quality which is subject to new pressures stemming from the trend towards lower flows and higher temperatures. 27ANNEX B. ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE ▶ The promotion of the efficient use of water which should be oriented as a priority to the achievement of net savings in the consumption in those places where exploitation rates are high and resources are dwindling. ▶ The contribution of new resources from desalination (from renewable energy sources) and the reuse aimed at reducing the gap between consolidated demands and available resources. ▶ The revision of the concessions to adapt them to the resources actually available trying to prevent the episodes of unsatisfied demands become chronic giving rise to crises and conflicts of uses of a structural nature. B.2.4.3 Soils and desertification Desertification is a complex process with multiple interrelated factors processes and actions that give rise to a more or less progressive degradation of the environment. The combination of factors natural and human factors that lead to desertification and their interrelationships can be seen in the following figure: FIGURE B.7 Factors leading to desertification FACTORS FACTORS Torrencialidad GEOMORPHOLOGICAL CLIMATE Drought Aridity soil loss Fires Desertification and vegetation use not sustainable of the resources FACTORS HUMANS Pressure human Source: MAGRAMA 2016 A study carried out within the framework of the PNACC has analyzed the impact of climate change on the risk of desertification in Spain. For this he considered between all the factors and parameters that intervene in the desertification risk map those most directly involved with climatic variables and therefore future risk of desertification: the index of aridity and soil erosion17. 17 Soil erosion was measured through the R factor that measures the erosivity of the rain. 28ANNEX B. ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE The main trends derived from the analysis are18. ▶ Increase of the surface in the categories of greater aridity very little accused in the most arid category and very accused in the category of semi-arid above all ▶ Slight increase in erosivity (Factor R) in the period 2011-2040 throughout the national territory. ▶ Jointly considering the evolution of aridity and erosion changes in the risk map of desertification show that they all increase. ▶ The most fragile ecosystems less able to adapt to expected changes in temperature and precipitation They will be the most vulnerable to degradation. Considering the multi-causal nature of desertification the fight against this phenomenon must include proposals and proposals from all sectors involved in particular the forestry and agricultural sectors to the management of water resources: “activities to combat desertification must by definition integrated land use in arid zones semi-arid and dry sub-humid for sustainable development and have intended to prevent or reduce land degradation the rehabilitation of partially degraded lands and the recovery of already desertified lands”19. The National Action Program against Desertification20 (PAND) establishes the necessary measures and actions. In the forest field the measures to be adopted coincide with those included in this Strategy in chapter 4 absorptions in the LULUCF sector (management and restoration of forests/forest lands) highlighting the synergy between adaptation and mitigation policies in this sector. B.2.4.4 Agriculture cattle raising The impact of climate change on agriculture in Spain is expected to vary in magnitude depending on geographical location and the subsector (type of crop or livestock). Nevertheless generally most pronounced hydric altering production. On the other hand extreme weather which will be more frequent and virulent. What's more of the weather will have a significant impact on performance and predictably Changes in seasonality and climate variability will have a significant impact in performance and predictably As an example Figure B.8 shows the variation of the areas with high climatic potential for wine quality. Are zones are identified from the combined values of the Huglin indices night coolness and drought. In the period 1971-2000 the area with the greatest wine-growing potential constituted 47% of the Spanish area embargo for the period 2021-2050 greatest potential would be within the Protected Designations of Origin a percentage that would be reduced to 19% for the period 2021-2050. 18 MAGRAMA (2016). Impacts of climate change on desertification processes in Spain. 19 MAGRAMA (2016). Impacts of climate change on desertification processes in Spain. 20 https://www.mapa.gob.es/es/desarrollo-rural/temas/politica-forestal/desertificacion-restauracion-forestal/lucha-contra-la-desertificacion/lch_pand.aspx 29ANNEX B. ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE FIGURE B.8 Areas of high climatic potential for vitivinicultural quality (1971-2000 and 2021-2050) Source: COAG (2016) The main impacts in the fishing field are related to the geographical redistribution of marine species such as consequence of warming acidification and loss of oxygen from seawater catch yields. Faced with this horizon, there are many effective adaptation practices at the farm level and also at the sectoral level. They apply to production with adaptive techniques consumption that can cause qualitative and quantitative changes in the way food is produced. The innovation the improvement and transmission of knowledge can contribute to a more adapted agricultural sector and sustainable. Some of the lines of work to continue developing are: ▶ Identification of vulnerable areas and sectors and evaluation of the needs and opportunities for management change crops varieties and breeds in response to climatic trends. ▶ Support for agricultural research and experimental production for crop selection development of varieties and management models that best adapt to the new conditions. ▶ Building adaptive capacity through awareness information and individual advice on farm management. ▶ Promotion of the Mediterranean diet and the consumption of local and seasonal products (see section C.5 on Non-energy diffuse emissions). ▶ Implementation of food chains well adapted to the projected changes that sustainably use natural resources and provide an adequate quality of life to those who are in each of its links. B.2.4.5 Forest planning and management The effects of climate change on forest ecosystems in Spain are already evident in many aspects: changes in the distribution of arboreal and supra-arboreal formations structural and functional modifications woodland health increased vulnerability to extreme weather events and fires and environmental services provided by forests etc. And the projected impacts point to an intensification of these effects as the 21st century progresses. 30ANNEX B. ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE So The adaptation of forest systems through their management and planning is an unavoidable task for the sector. The adaptation must focus on achieving the system that best adjusts to the new conditions, providing the greatest number of goods and services. What's more the forestry sector is strategically important as a natural sink in the goal of climate neutrality a 2050 to which must be added the dependence on the fundamental ecosystem services sustained by forests (conservation of biodiversity regulation of the hydrological cycle will deteriorate if management criteria and adaptive planning are not applied. Some of the priority lines of work identified are: ▶ Incorporation of individualized adaptive criteria for each enclave through the application of the scenarios regionalized climate change planning included in forest management projects. ▶ Inclusion of a hydrological-forestry perspective in the development of an integrated planning of the territory; promotion of forests as a tool for regulating climatic conditions at the local level and as disaster risk reduction instrument. ▶ Updating of the regions of origin of forest reproductive material taking into account the regionalized climate change scenarios as an instrument for planning (reforestation initiatives and restoration of existing stands). The adaptation of forest systems through their management and planning is a unavoidable for the sector. Adaptation should focus on achieving the system that best suits adjustment to new conditions providing the greatest number of goods and services. B.2.4.6 Tourism Spain's leadership as a tourist destination is largely associated with favorable weather conditions to the natural heritage attraction architectural of infrastructure and services. However the tourism sector Spain is susceptible to various impacts of climate change associated with trends such as the increase in temperature which in Spain is higher than the global average and more pronounced in the summer season available water and the rise in sea level and its effects on the coast. Four key aspects have been identified in which tourism is particularly sensitive to climate change: tourism resources tourist infrastructure tourism supply and demand affecting with special intensity the coastal and snow destinations. Adaptation to climate change in the tourism sector involves recognizing the risks posed by climate change protect the natural and cultural resources that contribute to the tourist attraction of Spain adapt infrastructure and equipments and move towards more sustainable and resilient tourism models in the face of climate change. B.2.4.7 City urbanism and building Some of the impacts associated with climate change acquire special relevance in the urban environment. On one side the concentration of population and infrastructure (housing public services strategic spaces in terms of adaptation; for other the physical characteristics of urban spaces amplify 31ANNEX B. ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE a certain number of impacts derived from climate change: for example the heat island effect amplifies the effects of high temperatures; the high degree of waterproofing of the soil constitutes a factor of vulnerability to torrential rain having less capacity for water infiltration in the soil. What's more healthy urban microclimates clearly contribute to the quality of life in cities. The actions concrete initiatives developed in the field of urban adaptation are highly visible to the people and frequently positive collaterals and synergies. For example improving green infrastructure mitigates the “heat island” effect brings obvious benefits to the urban landscape creating more welcoming and relaxing spaces for its inhabitants. One of the key tools that regional and local administrations have to prevent the risks derived from of climate change is urban planning. Take into consideration the risks derived from climate change when structuring the territory and assigning preferential uses and limitations to land uses limits the vulnerability of new urban developments. Vulnerability can also be reduced in already consolidated spaces through interventions on public space the housing stock ▶ Spanish cities must define and develop their own policy on adaptation what will there be join the different spheres of local management. ▶ In the coming years, territorial and urban planning and the integration of adaptation in building must consolidate itself as a strategic tool against the risks derived from climate change. ▶ Municipal plans to combat climate change and municipal adaptation plans have been revealed as useful elements for the construction of a local governance system. B.2.4.8 Coastal areas A third of the Spanish population resides in its coastal strip despite the fact that this constitutes only a 6 During the first years of the 21st century, the population residing in coastal municipalities has grown at a rate higher than the national average (1 9 % the main economic activities of the country: tourism. The dangers derived from climate change on the coasts include the increase in the frequency and intensity of coastal storms the permanent flooding sea level rise erosion and loss of key ecosystems as a result of global warming sea water According to the projections rigid coastal elements will suffer an increase in flooding which will be moderate in its intensity but more important in its frequency. As an example the city of Bilbao the level of flooding in a period of 50 years (CI ) would exceed 3 85 m in 2010 to 4 m in 2040. Without 50 embargo the flood elevation of 3 non-rigid coastal elements such as beaches sea level rise causes the loss and fragmentation of habitats and in many cases a setback from the sand A third of the Spanish population resides in its coastal strip even though this constitutes only a 6 7% of the territory. During the first years of the 21st century, the population residing in coastal municipalities has grown at a rate higher than the national average (1 9 % % global). 21 losada I and others (2014).

ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE The Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change on the Spanish Coast22 approved in 2016 guidelines and identifies measures aimed at increasing the resilience of the coast and integrating adaptation to climate change in coastal planning and management. Protection measures are proposed accommodation and recoil Development of new tools for risk analysis on the coast. Reinforcement of early warning systems and creation of evacuation protocols. Integration of coastal risks in land use and urban planning plans. beach conservation dune systems B.2.4.9 Marine environment The ocean is a key part of the climate system. Thus it is essential to ensure the health of the seas and oceans23 to limit the risks arising from climate change. Global warming is causing major changes in oceans including physical-chemical changes: ▶ Sea level rise that has accelerated in recent decades. ▶ Water acidification. ▶ Loss of dissolved oxygen. ▶ Increased temperatures. ▶ Changes in ocean currents And also biological changes: ▶ Changes in the distribution of marine species. ▶ Phenological changes. ▶ Decrease in primary production. ▶ Mass mortality in specific species24. These changes entail at the same time They provide food for humanity and constitute an essential link in the water cycle on the planet. Adaptation to climate change in the marine environment requires work on various complementary fronts highlighting: Monitoring of the impacts of climate change on the marine environment. The management of Marine Protected Areas. Sustainable management of fishing activity. The protection of marine biodiversity. 22 For more information: https://www.adaptecca.es/sites/default/files/editor_documentos/Estrategia_Adaptacion_al_CC_de_la_Costa_Espano- the_2016_Approved.pdf 23 Kerstin D.

ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE B.2.4.10 Mobility and transportation The transport infrastructures that are currently in the planning process in Spain will have in its overwhelmingly lifetimes that go beyond 2050. Therefore are suitable for the climatic conditions that they must withstand throughout their useful life. Regarding existing infrastructures their vulnerability to climate-related adversities it is diverse. A questionnaire designed by Puertos del Estado and sent to the authorities of state-owned ports has made it possible to identify the wind and waves as the variables related to the climate that most affect the operations of the same being able to paralyze the activity in most of them25. The transport infrastructures that are currently in the planning process in Spain they will have in its vast majority so much its design features need to be suitable for the conditions climatic conditions that they must withstand throughout their useful life. On the other hand A study carried out by CEDEX has identified the sections of the State Highway Network and the Potentially more exposed General Interest Railway Network identifying the types of events that most affect frequency to the different sections of the network and its impact on users and infrastructure26. In general terms it is estimated that the current vulnerability is higher in the railway network that has some important affectation in 12% of its longitude compared to 6% in the case of the Road Network. Considering a set of climate projections27 for a time horizon of 30 years and based on the expert judgment of highway and railway technicians will produce slight increases in vulnerability compared to the current somewhat higher on the rail network. The incorporation of new standards in the design and management of infrastructures that respond to the possible future climate conditions is a process that has already begun. Nevertheless must be integrated generalized the adaptive dimension in each project and each important work. Critical infrastructures with the greatest potential vulnerability as is the case of the ports its operational capacity due to factors such as the rise in sea level or the increase in water temperature they must have specific adaptation plans28. B.2.4.11 Energy system Adaptation to climate change over the next three decades will have to take place in a scenario of rapid decarbonization of the Spanish energy system. In this way the features that define the emerging system will define its future vulnerabilities. In any case it is evident that climate change and climate variability produce impacts on different components of the energy system may affect production (for example primary resources such as wind sun or water) as well as your request. 25 Gomi D. and Alvarez 26 Account A. (2018). Sections of the state network of land transport infrastructure potentially more exposed due to the variability and climate change. CEDEX Madrid. 27 The projections used the results of Euro-Cordex based on models from the IPCC Fifth Report. 28 The Puertos del Estado agency has recently completed a pilot adaptation plan for the port of Gijón and with the methodology designed plans to draw up adaptation plans for another 10 state-owned ports in the near future. 34ANNEX B. ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE Regarding the impacts on production a recent study by the European Commission29 estimates a global rise in the average temperature of the atmosphere of 2°C an average decrease of 4% of flow hydroelectric in the southwestern European region which includes Spain These reductions in hydroelectric production subject to significant year-on-year variation ensure a reliable power system. Regarding the effects on demand The increase in temperatures is causing changes in the needs heating and cooling. In the future the changes will be especially relevant in terms of refrigeration estimating a 14% increase in Cooling Degree-Days per decade in the period 2010-204930. Some of the lines of work to advance in the adaptation of the Spanish energy sector are: ▶ Preparation of projections on the impact of climate change on energy production potentials renewable such as hydroelectric or biomass ▶ Identification of highly vulnerable infrastructures and promotion of specific adaptation programs. ▶ Development of specific risk assessment tools for the sector. ▶ Development of adaptation standards for new energy infrastructures. ▶ Analysis of the impact of climate change on electricity demand of the associated changes in electricity demand to climate change and integration of the results in energy planning and the fight against poverty energetic. It is evident that climate change and climate variability have impacts on different components of the energy system may affect production (for example through changes in the availability of primary resources such as wind sun or water) the generation as well as your request. In that sense It is worth mentioning that the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030 submitted by Spain to the Commission The European Union already includes an extensive section on the adaptation of the energy system to the impacts derived from climate change. B.2.4.12. Financial system and insurance activity Moving towards a resilient society in the face of climate change requires a significant mobilization of resources and investments. The financial system must contribute to adaptation to climate change and at the same time long-term financial system by evaluating the risks associated with climate change that affect the financial system and reducing their exposure and vulnerability. For this, it is essential to incorporate adaptation to climate change in sustainable finance initiatives as a key element to respond to the impacts of climate change. 29 Biselink B. et al. (2018). Impact of a changing climate chnical Reports. European Commission. https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/impact-changing-climate-land-use-and-water-usage-europe-s-wa- ter-resources-model-simulation-study 30 Girardi G. and others (2015).

ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE For your part The insurance sector has a fundamental role in the response to climate change for the transfer and distribution of risks. In addition to financial compensation after extreme events that contribute to the viability of the sectors socioeconomic against climate change insurance can promote disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate change in these sectors. For this, it is necessary to explore the full potential of the insurance activity at the same time that its solvency and long-term stability are promoted through adaptation measures. The characteristics of the Spanish insurance system in which the State intervenes through figures such as the Insurance Compensation Consortium have made it be taken as a reference of success at the in the context of adaptation to climate change. B.2.5 Health protection Climate change affects human health through various pathways: episodes of high temperatures aggravate cardiovascular and respiratory diseases especially among the elderly. The people that work outdoors and those exercising outdoors are also particularly vulnerable groups. On the other hand climate change affects food security to your health. What's more climate change has expanded the geographic distribution or increased the severity of transmitted diseases by water and by vectors such as visceral leishmaniasis Lyme borreliosis west nile virus dengue and chikungunya. In Spain the impact on mortality is especially prominent in the case of heat waves the death of more than 14,000 people is associated in the period 1980-2017. As of 2004 (following the extreme heat wave of the summer of 2003) the Prevention Plan for the effects of high temperatures on health has had a clear positive effect although difficult to quantify mortality attributed to heat waves. In the figure below shows the record of maximum temperatures triggering daily mortality in the capitals of Spanish province in the period 2000-2009. The large differences in the temperatures from which it is fired heat-associated mortality in them reflects the existence of different “heat cultures” and highlights the essential role that adaptation mechanisms play a role in limiting the risks associated with the climate. 36ANNEX B. ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE FIGURE B.9 Maximum trigger temperatures for daily mortality (2000-2009) Source: VVAA (2015)31 According to recent scientific studies in a high emission scenario say considering that the mortality trigger thresholds previously estimated for each of the capitals of Spanish provinces remained unchanged) it is estimated that in the period 2021-2050 more than 1,400 deaths/year. However a suitable adaptation could reduce that figure to approximately 650 deaths/year32 (less than half). The protection of human health against climate change requires work in various lines including: ▶ The integration of the climate change variable in public health plans. ▶ Prevention of the effects of high temperatures on health. ▶ Preparation for and response to infectious and parasitic diseases favored by climate change. ▶ Preventive action against occupational risks aggravated by the effects of climate change. 31 Diaz Jimenez J. period 2000-2009.

ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE B.2.5.1 Civil protection The National Civil Protection Strategy33 identifies climate change as one of the main factors “risk enhancers” in Spain specifically highlighting its relationship with the aggravation of heat waves and droughts and with the meteorological conditions that favor the great forest fires. This recognition paves the way for an effective integration of the adaptation approach in public protection policies. civil especially in terms of prevention. Advances in this field go through the regulatory development of Law 17/2015 promoting the elaboration of the corresponding civil protection plans and in particular State Civil Protection that it maintains due coherence with the strategies for adaptation to climate change. in addition the IPCC Special Report SR 1.5 (2018) points to a possible reduction in food availability in the sahel region southern Africa or the Mediterranean basin can be avoided These changes will require responses from European humanitarian action and civil protection policies34. B.3 IMPLICATIONS OF THE IMPACTS OF CHANGE CLIMATE OUTSIDE While climate change mitigation is conceived as a global challenge both the impacts derived from the change Climate change and adaptation have traditionally been perceived as problems of a regional or local nature. This vision is biased to understand vulnerability in an intensely connected and globalized world35. Spain is related One way or another these connections the impacts derived from climate change that occur outside the country end up having repercussions in the national territory. The special exposure that the Mediterranean arch has to climate change has already been commented on I know produce it inside or outside the European borders. The impacts of climate change can be transmitted through the following routes36: ▶ Trade flows: affecting prices and supply chains. ▶ Financial flows: distorting the flows of public and private capital. ▶ Human flows: triggering migrations and modifying tourist flows. ▶ Geopolitical changes: affecting humanitarian assistance policies defense or cooperation. Spain is related One way or another planetary. As a result of these connections the impacts of climate change that occur outside the country end up having an impact on the national territory. 33 PCI Order/488/2019 from April 26 tional. https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2019/04/30/pdfs/BOE-A-2019-6348.pdf 34 EC (2018b).

ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE For all this it is necessary to know the nature of the impacts of climate change that occur outside the territory Spanish and that may have effects at the national level. It is also important to strengthen international cooperation on of adaptation to move towards more resilient societies in the face of climate change throughout the world. Some of the effects that can be analyzed for the Spanish case are: ▶ Possible changes in migration or tourist flows. ▶ The risks on the supply chains of different economic sectors but especially the agri-food (both imports and exports). ▶ Opening of new maritime transport routes. ▶ The risks associated with investments in countries with high vulnerability to climate change. B.4 CONCLUSIONS Spain is experiencing relevant impacts derived from climate change which are likely to worsen in the future as the climate crisis progresses. Considering the changes that have already occurred and anticipating those that are projected is a inescapable need. In this way incorporating the adaptive dimension into this strategy is essential. The Mediterranean region is subject to greater climatic stress than other European areas. The climate of this area has traits that have been a challenge for the societies of the region: low rainfall dry periods recurrent derived from the coincidence of the hot season and the dry season high summer temperatures traits tend to be accentuated as a result of climate change posing important adaptive challenges. It will be necessary Thus that adaptation policies continue to be strengthened at EU level. Neither in Spain are the impacts evenly distributed in geographical or social terms. so that they can create or accentuate existing inequalities. Adaptation also represents an opportunity to prevent a increase in inequalities. Sectoral policies must consider the new challenges arising from the climate crisis and coordinate to provide responses integrated to challenges such as water management land degradation people. Given the breadth and depth of the challenge adaptation can only be effectively addressed if it becomes a socially shared challenge. Finally adaptation and mitigation of climate change must be promoted as stable policies and complementary. 39ANEXO C DECARBONIZATION SECTORIAL 40ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION The following sections analyze the status and expected evolution of the different sectors taking into account the technological options available for their transformation and the challenges and opportunities that its decarbonization in 2050.

With regard to the net generation of electricity 268,867 GWh were reached in that year. The corresponding power structure is presented in the following figure: FIGURE C.3 Electricity generation structure382018 Source: Based on the Spanish electricity system report 2018 REE 38 Other sources include non-renewable thermal/Cogeneration and rest/Cogeneration Non-renewable waste.

SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION Emissions from the electricity sector amounted to 64 million tons of CO equivalent that year 18% of the total. The 2 composition of the production mix determines the variations of the associated CO emissions. 2 The share of renewables in electricity generation fixed the effect of hydraulicity the 35 2% above the European average shows the evolution of the weight of renewable energies in the generation of electrical energy in Spain with respect to the European average.

This high capacity to integrate electricity production from renewable sources together with the recent but every time higher Participation of electrical renewables in the adjustment markets of the electrical system the lower installation costs of these technologies show the excellent starting point of Spain to continue notably increasing said participation and thus taking important steps towards the full decarbonization of the same in 2050. 43ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.1.2 Horizon 2030 The PNIEC 2021-2030 presents the steps towards the decarbonization of the economy over the next decade. According Plan forecasts achieves a very significant reduction in emissions from the electricity generation sector in that period. in addition reaches 74% renewable electricity production in 2030. This development will be a consequence of the degree of technological maturity already shown by the different generation technologies of renewable electrical energy and in many cases market prices. For this, a significant volume of investment is necessary, which will not only be directed at the renewable generation facilities but also to other elements of the electrical system. The change of the electrical system should be accompanied by short and long-term economic signals that show the value to the system of the products and services that different technologies can offer serving as a guide to attract and maintain efficiently the high volumes of investment that are going to be necessary to carry out the Energy Transition. For the period between 2030 and 2050, the increase in renewable installed power will no longer be so high quantitatively as in this decade but its integration into the electrical system will be more complex. The need to avoid high discharges from renewable generation maintain the quality of the electricity supply and integrate a large volume of distributed generation will require a series of technological developments addressed in the next section. C.1.3 Horizon 2050 The configuration of the electrical system in the year 2050 will be highly dependent on future technological disruptions of the objectives and commitments assumed in the field of a transition towards a low-carbon economy of the appearance of new business models and growing social awareness. It's not so However yes, the main transforming trends of the electrical system can be identified incorporation of new renewable generation technologies mass storage no) local energy communities artificial intelligence and sector coupling. C.1.3.1 Demand management One of the most relevant transformations, both in the short and long term, will be the participation of demand in the electrical market. In particular the new European regulation of the internal market39 already encourages the response of the demand. In application of said regulation the market will evolve towards a design that provides effective price signals through which the active participation of the demand and the possibility of its aggregation is guaranteed. Along with changes in the behavior of people and companies technologies will be required to enable such share of demand in the market such as high-speed, low-latency communications demand aggregator services among other things. 39 Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 5, 2019 on common rules for the internal market of electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU and Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council June 5 2019 on the internal electricity market. 44ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.1.3.2 Interconnections In the case of Spain it will also be very relevant at least in the short and medium term interconnection with the rest of Europe. The increase in interconnection capacity will increase security of supply at a particularly critical moment due to the greater penetration of non-regulated renewable energies and intermittent nature. The interconnections will also make it possible to reduce discharges once the renewable production capacity exceeds the demand improving the profitability of these energies and facilitating their greater implementation. As can be seen in the following figure the Iberian Peninsula continues to appear deficient in its level of interconnection with the mainland according to the recommendation of the ENTSO-e experts to set the interconnection criteria after of 202040. FIGURE C.5 Electrical energy exchange capacities41 Fuente:  ENTSO-e - TYNDP 2018 Regional Insight Report North-South Interconnections West Although there is a European objective of reaching a minimum capacity of 10% of interconnection between the members of the EU for the year 2020 (15% in 2030) Spain is still very far from those figures. The Declarations of Madrid (2015) and Lisbon (2018) signed by Spain France with France in 2025 for the Bay of Biscay project that is already running in the central area of the Pyrenees that should come into operation before 2027. Nevertheless beyond 2030 technically and economically suitable within the framework of the integration of the Community Electricity Market and according to the compliance with the various National Energy and Climate Plans of the different European countries. 40 in 2017 a group of experts (ITEG) proposed to replace the criterion of 15% interconnection capacity over installed power by a new methodology based on 3 criteria: market price difference <€2/MWh interconnection capacity >30% of peak demand and interconnection capacity >30% of peak generation. 41 In this analysis 2030 scenarios with the 2020 network that the commissioning of the project is currently scheduled for 2021. 45ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.1.3.3 Network management In the Climate Neutrality Scenario the design and operation of the transmission and distribution networks must facing important challenges such as the existence of a greater distributed generation and with very high levels of intermittence. higher than the current as well as the transformation of the traditional model of unidirectional energy flows from the generation centers towards a model of bidirectional and changing flows. Technologies should be promoted for a flexible and safe operation of a 100% renewable electrical system. A) Yes the massive deployment of power electronics or other technologies will allow a great introduction of asynchronous technologies both on the generation side and on the demand side. digitization coordination between transport and distribution of electrical energy consumers becoming prosumers C.1.3.4 Storage Finally storage deserves a special mention renewables that is compatible with a safe operation of the electricity system. It should be noted that storage is a broad concept with various nuances the analysis of which requires certain preliminary clarifications. FIGURE C.6 Storage networks and homes Source: Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge 2020 46ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION This service can be offered by different technologies some already mature and others still competing to advance in their learning curves improving its performance and cost competitiveness. A) Yes hydraulic and thermal storage with molten salts batteries are joining (of different technologies) uses hydrogen as an energy vector or other variants of renewable gas production as well as other solutions very innovative that are being studied in various countries from the conceptual phases to the pilot phases. Are technologies present very different levels of maturity and competitiveness. The Energy Storage Strategy collects and expands these aspects. network services Adjustment services of the electrical network such as frequency regulation secondary regulation or the additional power to raise can be efficiently covered by different technologies storage. It is foreseeable that the importance and economic value of these services will increase as the penetration rate increases. of renewables. Some of these applications require high power for very short periods of time. while others require frequent charge and discharge cycles so that each of these services can be covered with different storage technologies. behind the counter There is also great potential for development of storage in the client “behind the counter” self-consumption that will allow consumers to optimize their electricity bill by being able to better adjust their contracting of network needs. In fact studies by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) foresee that this modality can be the fastest growing segment for fixed battery storage by 2030. There is great potential for customer storage development “behind the counter” associated or not with self-consumption that will allow consumers to optimize their bill by being able to better adjust their contracting of network needs. generation support For your part thermal storage of thermal or concentrating solar plants allows to improve their response curves and offer better regulation services. On the other hand in the case of renewable generation manageable such as wind or photovoltaic production hours as well as having a quick response in the event of a lack of appeal. another good example of hybridized technologies are solar thermal plants that have thermal storage in molten salts it that allows them to overcome the transients of solar irradiation as well as prolong electricity generation. daily storage All of the above services are going to play a relevant role in the medium and long term of the electricity system. What's more of the necessary firmness and flexibility of system operation services in which storage may participate competing with generation and demand the Iberian electricity system will need to have a large contingent storage in two dimensions: fast response and large-scale mass storage that serves as strategic reserve and dispatches planned according to demand. 47ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION seasonal storage For your part seasonal storage refers to the variability of generation within the year and the variability YoY With the technologies that are currently known Everything indicates that a combination of solutions will be necessary energy storage including the “Power to Gas” hydrogen or others; in addition to the storage provided by adjustable hydraulics. Cost evolution It is necessary to distinguish between when electricity storage will be essential in the energy transition when it will become a viable economic opportunity. A) Yes there are already hydroelectric pumps operating that are economical and some new pumping projects are borderline profitable. Solar thermal energy with storage has evolved positively in its costs Nevertheless market it is not yet profitable if the storage does not have a higher economic value. The batteries for your part most applications. Nevertheless there are some niches meter” where they are getting closer to being a viable economic option. The potential for cost reduction of emerging technologies is very significant. According to a study of the International Renewable Energy Agency42 the total cost of installing lithium-ion (Li-Ion) batteries for stationary use could be reduced between 54% and 61% until 2030. In any case profitability largely depends on the strength and design of price signals and mechanisms of markets in which storage can participate. Thus It is necessary that the regulation of the market in the coming decades provides the framework and adequate signals to align the profitability of the different types of installations with the needs of the system. The potential for cost reduction of emerging technologies is very significant. According to a study by the International Renewable Energy Agency the total cost of installation of lithium-ion (Li-Ion) batteries for stationary use could be reduced between 54% and 61% until 2030. Expected evolution for storage Currently in Spain there are 3 installed 3 GW of pure pumping and 2 Adjustable hydraulic generation capacity. On the horizon 2030 the PNIEC foresees that an additional storage capacity of 6 GW (with a minimum of two hours of storage at maximum load) as well as 5 new GW of solar thermal power plants with molten salt storage whose precise composition and operation will be developed based on the technological evolution and availability. further It is planned to have more storage capacity associated with other systems such as distributed systems (behind the meter) or flexibility services that can provide the fleet of electric vehicles. These aspects will be expanded and addressed in greater detail in the Strategy of energy storage whose draft is in the public consultation phase as of October 2020. 42 IRENA (2017): “Electricity storage and renewables: Costs and markets to 2030” 48ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION In summary security of electricity supply is achieved by increasing the storage capacity around a 30% compared to what will be available that year. All this considering a scenario without international interconnections additional to those already provided. C.1.4 Challenges and opportunities Regulatory Changes The deployment of storage technologies will require the establishment of sectoral regulatory frameworks that provide adequate economic signals to undertake these investments. A) Yes services will need to be redesigned current or regular new ones for system operation. Given that these services are currently focused on the operation of fossil fuel-based plants and in the future these services will be provided by renewable energies. renewable for storage in any of its forms all of it determined by the capacity analyzes carried out by the system operator in the different horizons temporary and integrated into the capacity mechanisms in accordance with the principles established in the regulations European internal electricity market. Given the anticipated rapid technological evolution and the potential diversity of different solutions that may entail the objective is to equip itself with a regulation to adequately promote the development of flexibility mechanisms at the same time that it offers sufficient long-term certainty to mobilize the necessary investments. The objective is to endow itself with a regulation to adequately promote the development of flexibility mechanisms while offering sufficient long-term certainty to mobilize the necessary investments. Specific to reconcile the prudence that should characterize any new regulation with the need to facilitate new developments new mechanisms are proposed such as regulatory test benches or "sandboxes" be developed in various European countries taking as an example the experiences in the world of financial technologies “fintech” and that have been included in the PNIEC. It will also be essential to ensure regulatory coordination and a correct institutional and governance design. Another noteworthy challenge is the need to simultaneously regulate micro aspects with a macro vision of the system. electrical and energy. A) Yes it is required to regulate the pan-European electrical system a common internal market between the Member States and at the same time small scale of local communities and self-consumption with the possibility of storage and provision of services to the system in local markets ensuring supply at all times at efficient prices. in addition society must perceive that the existing electrical infrastructures are used appropriately what is necessary to optimize its use maximizing the capacity of electric corridors and introducing a management dynamics of the network that allows to increase the effective capacities of evacuation and transport. It is also essential to introduce mechanisms for correcting and minimizing the adverse environmental effects of renewable projects disseminate the benefits among society and design mechanisms for their redistribution among the groups that are most directly affected by these installations as well as the active participation of the citizenship in the change of model (this measure is already included in the PNIEC). 49ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION Industrial and economic opportunities The decarbonization process of the electricity sector is associated with great opportunities and important advantages for our economy and our business fabric especially to the extent that we are able to anticipate at the technological regulatory and industry. The development of renewable self-consumption decentralization of electricity generation new generation plants and the rest of the actions included in the PNIEC and in this document important development in the coming years while presenting very positive impacts. Have a positive economic impact both from the point of view of GDP growth and growth of job. And also an impact on health due to the reduction of local environmental pollution which will result in an increase in air quality in Spain. In this way Spain is an industrial power in the manufacture of equipment for the generation of renewable energy especially in the wind fields photovoltaic and solar thermal renewable electricity generation necessary to meet the decarbonization goals. Renewable energies are not the only sector that offers future opportunities in the field of decarbonisation. battery storage although it is much less developed domestically than in Asian competitors also presents numerous opportunities especially in technologies that go beyond Li-Ion. In that sense initiatives are beginning to be developed at a European level to reduce our differential in the development of batteries with Asian countries. There is also a regional cooperation platform at European level focused on advanced materials for batteries. This platform has 27 European regions (including Andalusia and the Basque Country) and currently six pilot projects have been established (two of them led by Spanish regions: “Sustainable Raw Material Extraction and Processing”; así como “Liquid based-batteries Spain is an industrial power in the manufacture of capital goods and electronics of power for renewable energy generation especially in the wind fields photovoltaic and solar thermal and must take advantage of it to facilitate the deployment of facilities renewable electricity generation necessary to meet the objectives of decarbonization hydrogen for your part (IPCEI) led by the European Commission as one of the nine strategic value chains for Europe. At the moment work is being done on defining its action plan and associated initiatives. At the national level has been published the "Road Map of the Hydrogen: a commitment to renewable hydrogen”. Spain participated in the signing of the Hydrogen Initiative in the Informal Council of Energy Ministers celebrated on September 2018 to promote this technology a field with a Spanish presence in various projects, both state and as autonomous. 50ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.2 SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY AND TRANSPORTATION C.2.1 Current situation In 2018, the transport and mobility sector in Spain represented a consumption of 43%43 of the final energy demand being responsible for 27% of COeq44 emissions in 2018 (in the EU they were 22%). As seen in 2 the following figure GHG emissions from the transport sector in Spain have grown by 50% since 1990 In the EU, this increase has been of the order of 20%.

It can also be seen the detail of distribution of GHG emissions by type of vehicle. In relation to final energy consumption according to data from the Energy Report in Spain 43% of that of Spain 94% dependent on petroleum products. Road transport represented in 2018 77% of final energy consumption in Spain with a consumption of passenger traffic of 71% and goods of 90% as shown in the figure below.

SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION The exposed data allow us to verify the relevance of road transport both in final energy consumption as in GHG emissions. It is important to mention the effort that the automobile manufacturing industry has made to achieve reductions progressive reduction of CO emissions in new passenger vehicles in order to comply with Regulation (EC) 443/2009 2 which establishes standards of behavior in terms of emissions. The following graph shows the evolution of the CO emissions from new passenger cars. 2 FIGURE C.11 Evolution of CO2 emissions from new passenger cars 160 140 120 m 100 to /2 0 C 80 g 60 40 20 0 2.006  2.008  2.010  2.012  2.014  2.016  2.018 Source: General Directorate of Traffic 2017 Imposes in consecuense decarbonization but to improve competitiveness with neighboring countries. Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in the transport-mobility sector presents the following peculiarities: ▶ Emission sources are diffuse that is, they are scattered foci. The private vehicle represents in Spain 15% of final energy consumption. ▶ It has a very high dependence (94%) on fossil fuels mainly petroleum derivatives. ▶ It is necessary to decouple economic growth and the increase in the number of inhabitants of the increases in passenger and freight traffic as well as the increase in the ratio of vehicles owned. Otherwise the effects of energy efficiency measures or even fuel substitution would be canceled by the greater number of passengers-km and ton-km derived from economic growth and population growth. 53ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.2.2 Horizon 2030 In order to achieve the decarbonization of the transport sector in the year 2050 part of the situation foreseen for the year 2030 by the PNIEC. This includes a 30% reduction in environmental emissions compared to today as well as one reduction in the share of petroleum products in final energy consumption. further in the year 2030 via electrification and biofuels. Regarding the policies and measures according to the forecasts of the Plan in energy efficiency will have a great impact on the decrease in final energy consumption. These include low-lying areas modal shift political emissions measures to increase efficiency in the use of vehicles and the introduction of more efficient new vehicles. On the other hand the introduction of alternative decarbonized technologies period 2030-2050 together with the continuous improvement of energy efficiency and technological innovations Hyperloop type projects. In the year 2030 a 28% share of renewable energy in transport is expected to be reached mainly via electrification and biofuels. C.2.3 Horizon 2050 The decarbonisation of the sector will come hand in hand with the intensification of energy efficiency measures before mentioned along with the replacement of fossil fuels with other low-carbon products. The electrification of road transport will be key in a scenario of high penetration of renewable energies in the electricity generation. For your part the use of renewable fuels (both liquid and gaseous) will be in vehicles heavy the air and maritime sector. The implementation of the respective technologies will be determined by the evolution of your costs which in turn will depend on the pace of their innovation. The study carried out by the Joint Research Center (JRC) in 201847 presents an estimate of the contribution of each of the the technologies available today in the reduction of GHG emissions worldwide. 46 Said percentage is calculated in accordance with the methodology established in Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on Renewable Energies. 47 Global Energy and Climate Outlook 2018: Sectoral mitigation options towards a low-emissions economy JRC 2018. 54ANNEX C.

Source: POLES JRC 2018 The technologies that are expected to play a more relevant role in decarbonising the transport sector in 2050 his: ▶ Energy efficiency measures and change in mobility modes. They allow to improve the energy intensity of the sector and reduce final energy consumption which will facilitate decarbonization at reasonable prices. The progressive introduction of smart and connected mobility solutions that promote intermodality the biggest efficiency in transport modes and personalized mobility solutions integrating private transport and public will play a fundamental role. ▶ Electrification. Key technology in the road sector for light vehicles and urban public transport. ▶ Renewable energy vectors liquids Especially relevant for heavy goods transport aviation and navigation. They may be of biological origin (preferably generated from waste) or of non-biological origin manufactured using Power to Liquid processes. renewable gases among which stand out: ▶ Hydrogen that can be used directly in a fuel cell or as an element intermediate in Power to Gas technologies and also in industrial applications that currently consume non-renewable H2. ▶ Biomethane produced from biogas or by methanation of synthesis gas obtained from the biomass gasification. 55ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION It is necessary to keep in mind that alternatives based on liquid fuels used in internal combustion engines are associated with emissions of local pollutants as well as some technological limits of efficiency. To address the decarbonization of transport-mobility, it is necessary to analyze the different modes separately: highway railway The level of penetration of each of the available technologies will be given by presenting the most efficient solution in costs that satisfy the technical and service requirements of each of the subsectors. The decarbonisation of the transport sector will come hand in hand with the intensification of energy efficiency measures Along with the substitution of fossil fuels for other zero-emission or low-carbon products. C.2.3.1 Road transport It is estimated that in 2050 highway. To decouple passenger-km traffic and transported ton-km economic growth and the number of population in the two decades between 2030-2050 2021 and 2030 detailed in the PNIEC and shared mobility. Advances in ICTs will play an important role as they will help manage demand and provide mobility services adjusted to real traffic conditions and in a personalized way: smart mobility and connected. There is technology to 100% decarbonize this subsector Yes OK of the hybrids the greatest difficulty in decarbonizing heavy vehicles residual consumption of fossil fuels in road transport. Next The actions available to advance decarbonisation are listed in more detail. C.2.3.1.1 Measures to improve energy efficiency in the sector road transport Energy efficiency measures not only support decarbonization but they improve the energy intensity and the energy saving which is key to achieving decarbonisation goals at a reasonable cost. Next They set out the main measures that will favor the improvement of energy efficiency in the transport sector. ▶ Measures that reduce mobility needs through urban design as well as flexibility and mobility labor through the intensive use of technologies such as videoconferences and so on. ▶ Measures to promote the modal shift from the private vehicle to other more efficient modes: transport public walking population and on the other hand frequency and quality of service so as to facilitate intermodality. in addition of smart and connected mobility solutions will enable mobility solutions that integrate not only intermodality but also private transport with public transport. 56ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION ▶ Change measures to the use of more efficient means of transport. At the moment the most energy efficient motor it is the electric motor. Therefore, the transition to electric mobility is not only a change of fuel but it also represents the shift to more efficient mobility in terms of energy consumed per km travelled. ▶ Transfer of goods from road to rail as well as a transfer of passengers from air transport to train taking advantage of the deployment of high speed already carried out. The increase in the modal share of transport by railway enables a significant reduction in CO emissions per ton-km since they are between 3 and 7 times 2 lower than those of road transport (depending on whether the traction of the train is diesel or electric). ▶ Measures to promote shared mobility both in urban and interurban areas smart and connected mobility. Shared mobility on trips (car pooling car-hiring) will especially allow decoupling the growth of the vehicle fleet from population growth and mitigating congestion in the cities. It is important to specify Nevertheless private are always positive as soon as their occupancy ratio increases car sharing can sometimes be a substitute for public transport. ▶ Improvement of the energy efficiency of combustion engines (hybridizations regenerative brakes of design lighter materials studies reductions of 31%48 in consumption per km in the 2015-2030 period. This trend is driven by the European Regulations on the reduction of CO emissions imposed on vehicle manufacturers49. 2 Energy efficiency measures in the road transport sector not only support decarbonization but rather improve energy intensity and energy savings which is key to achieving the objectives at a reasonable cost. ▶ Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications are shown as a viable solution to make the more efficient movement of people and goods in all modes. Implementation of management systems of fleets that optimize consumption according to the selection of routes loads of roads and infrastructure design. Design of navigators with “Eco” or “Green navigators” routes that they have in account these criteria against others (shortest or fastest route). The development of Big Data give greater connectivity to the vehicles that will be able to interact with the city and the transport infrastructures and will enable a higher level of vehicle automation which will have special relevance in consumption and emissions from road transport for both goods and passengers. ▶ Promotion of efficient driving and maintenance of driving guidelines. Although the introduction of increasingly autonomous vehicles with great technological advances in sensorization and algorithms of control will delegate these decisions to their software efficient driving by the manufacturers themselves. 48 Global Energy and Climate Outlook 2018: Sectorial mitigation options towards a low-emissions economy JRC 2018. 49 REGULATION (EU) 2019/631 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of April 17, 2019, which establishes rules of behavior CO emissions from new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles and by which the Regulations (CE) are repealed 2 nº 443/2009 y (UE) nº 510/2011.

SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.2.3.1.2 Alternative technologies to fossil fuels in the road transport electric vehicle The electrification of transport along with a mix of renewable generation decarbonization potential beyond the 2030 horizon and the speed with which its penetration occurs will be key to achieving the 2050 goals. Highest electric motor efficiency according to life cycle analysis “from the tank to the wheel” versus combustion of the order of 30-40% of energy in the sector. Even comparing life cycle analysis efficiencies from well to wheel the efficiency of electric vehicle with a mix of renewable electricity generation such as that projected in Spain in the PNIEC 2021-2030 is higher than that of the combustion vehicle50. The penetration of electrification (electric hybrids and plug-in hybrids) on motorcycles it is expected to be exponential due to technological developments and the expected progress in batteries. It is estimated that how late in 2025 these registrations will be the ones with the greatest implantation. Penetration will also be driven by the adoption of accompanying measures that internalize the negative externalities of fossil fuels and municipal ordinances aimed at improving air quality in cities. The evolution of the price of electric vehicles will be closely linked to the evolution of the price of batteries. The market current works with lithium ion batteries which have evolved from $1,000/kWh in 2010 to $190-200/kWh in 2016 expected to reach $73/kWh in 2030 (BNEF)51. It is estimated that from $100/kWh price parity will have been reached. The penetration of electrification is expected to be exponential due to technological developments and the expected advance in the batteries. Penetration will also be driven by the adoption of accompanying measures that internalize the negative externalities of fossil fuels and municipal ordinances aimed at improving air quality in the cities. In this new paradigm raw material supply chains will be very important. Nevertheless of the end of the useful life of the batteries the recyclability of materials standards for battery waste management and environmental requirements in design will be crucial to reduce the volumes of critical raw materials needed by limiting the risks of shortages and the corresponding environmental impact in the phases of extraction of materials and in the production of the vehicle. in addition research into new chemical batteries increase energy density and achieve the performance of current combustion models at competitive prices. is anticipated equally of predetermined routes that allow the planning of the recharge making it possible to design the smallest battery size adequate to make it an economically viable option. It will be necessary Nevertheless and its management to avoid contracting large powers in the depots and reconcile recharging with operations of bus maintenance that can have services from 16h. The fuel cell powered by Hydrogen will possibly be the alternative provided by manufacturers for buses with the highest fuel needs. autonomy and occupation. 50 New Energy Outlook 2019 BNEF 51 http://www.element-energy.co.uk/publications/ 58ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION The deployment of interoperable public charging infrastructure is not expected to be a barrier in the period 2030-2050. It is estimated that as a consequence of the implementation of the PNIEC 2021-2030 sufficient capillarity in 2030. In this context the electrification of passenger transport could be electrified practically 100% in 2050. However battery electrification of heavy goods vehicles long-distance freight will not be significant by 2030 and will continue to be a challenge to 2050 service (required autonomy) as well as due to challenges of a technical nature (maximum weight of vehicles) and costs. renewable fuels Biofuels are the most widely available and widely used renewable technology in the world today. transport. What's more in sectors such as heavy vehicles more competitive to decarbonize. The penetration of biofuels on the road until 2030 will be in accordance with the provisions of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources that sets minimum goals with a maximum contribution of conventional biofuels produced from food and feed crops and a mandatory minimum contribution of advanced biofuels. Advanced biofuels are those that are made from raw materials from Annex IX.A of said Directive (different types of waste). The maximum set for conventional biofuels introduced in order to promote the development of advanced and to minimize potential consequences of land use change implies that the contribution of this technology which will continue to be the most relevant of the renewables in transport until 2030 will be comparatively lower from of that year. The fulfillment of the consumption objectives until 2030 of advanced biofuels and the subsequent generalization of their use require a specific boost of their production. At the moment in some cases some of the raw materials considered and in others that allow the manufacture of this type of biofuels. Finally progress must be made in what has already been pointed out to 2030 in relation to general obligations of sale or consumption of biofuels and specifically in the aviation sector. It will be necessary to install as well biomass mobilization research into new processes and the necessary investments for advanced biofuel manufacturing facilities. will have to be implanted as well research into new processes and the necessary investments for biofuel manufacturing facilities advanced. However as mentioned before to existing propulsion systems and logistics supply systems do not solve the problems local polluting emissions and are also conditioned by the efficiency limits of current technologies in combustion engines. 59ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION renewable gases Natural gas of fossil origin as a substitute for diesel although it contributes to decarbonisation due to its own composition of the molecule it does not mitigate enough to reach demanding targets for decarbonisation of the sector. Thus it is necessary to advance in the generation of other gases or mixtures of natural gas with other gases of renewable origin what enable those goals to be achieved. This section includes the application in mobility of the following fuels: ▶ Hydrogen that can be used directly in fuel cells as an energy resource or as a mechanism flexibility in energy systems. ▶ Biomethane produced from biogas or by methanation of synthesis gas obtained from biomass gasification. Renewable gases and in particular the hydrogen used in fuel cells will play an important role from 2030 mainly in heavy vehicles (vans The substitution of fossil fuels for electric motors with batteries presents technical and economic restrictions for respond to the benefits offered by these categories of vehicles. Nevertheless to guarantee your contribution to decarbonization It will be necessary that the aforementioned gases and hydrogen are produced by processes that involve a substantial reduction in CO emissions throughout the life cycle and the accreditation of said reduction by 2 through the corresponding certification system. The development of renewable gases will require gains in production efficiency via economies of scale in the case of renewable hydrogen and learning line in the case of Power to Gas. In this way An industrial scale for electrolysis and the manufacture of fuel cells will be needed to make the market competitive. use of these gases in heavy transport. At the same time must ensure the deployment of the infrastructure of supply that for the investments required These technologies can contribute to decarbonisation in sectors such as energy transportation and industry what should be analyzed the development of integrated planning including regulatory aspects and support for the financing. The development of renewable gases will require gains in production efficiency via economies of scale in the case of renewable hydrogen and line learning in the case of Power to Gas. Other renewable liquid fuels of non-biological origin Until 2030 a significant contribution of these products is not expected manufactured using Power to Liquid processes such as ethanol methanol and maybe 60ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.2.3.2 Transport by rail Rail transport in Spain has experienced a great development in high speed fundamentally focused to passenger transport. However has not reached comparable freight transport quotas with the countries of our environment. The increase in the transfer of goods from road to rail is one of the measures that would contribute energy efficiency in the sector. When explaining this lack, different factors are listed: lack of capillarity of rail transport; the little weight rail-port traffic; little flexibility to adapt to schedules and so on 300 km are difficult to transfer from the road to the railway. The technologies available to mitigate emissions are energy efficiency and increased electrification. ▶ Efficiency measures in the operation of rail traffic. For example the introduction of ATO systems for incorporate efficient driving and improvements in the use of energy recovered in braking. ▶ Electrification of tracks not yet electrified. ▶ Use of liquid biofuels and renewable gases (in those sections where it is not feasible to electrify. The substitution of fuels derived from petroleum by renewable fuels counts already with experience in its use and its technical feasibility is proven. C.2.3.3 National air transport In addition to continuing to bet on energy efficiency in consumption the only alternative technology available to the use of Fossil fuels on the 2050 horizon are renewable fuels and electric motors in small aircraft. The actions contemplated are: ▶ Consumption efficiency measures such as improvements in air traffic management (mainly in the phase of landing and takeoff) and development of new, more efficient engines. According to data from the Transport Association International Air Force (IATA) 52 aircraft are expected to reduce their consumption by 70% in the period 2015-2050. ▶ Substitution of oil-derived fuels for renewable fuels. Already today there is experience in its use and its technical feasibility is proven. The particular specifications required for aviation kerosene means that so far there are few manufacturing technologies that allow obtain these products fulfilling the necessary parameters. ▶ For small aircraft electric motors could be an alternative batteries. ▶ Modal shift when there is a viable rail option. 52 https://www.iata.org/contentassets/8d19e716636a47c184e7221c77563c93/technology-roadmap-2013.pdf 61ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.2.3.4 Maritime transport The actions contemplated are: ▶ Energy efficiency measures in new and renovated ships (more efficient propulsion engines control of speed hull coating) which will mean reductions in consumption per transported ton-km of 24% in existing ships and up to 50% in new ships according to data from the International Maritime Organization (IMO). 2014). ▶ Electrical connection of ships to port during their docking phase. It is necessary to address the limitations of the network and the fees for it. this action in addition to decarbonizing of the air in port areas. ▶ Substitution of oil-derived fuels for renewable fuels. ▶ Due to increasingly stringent emission standards especially in ECA zones (Emission Control Areas) the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in ships is beginning to be implemented in operations in ports and maritime areas in order to comply with MARPOL regulations (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships). ▶ The design of ships that use LNG in port operations as well as crossing cost-benefit analysis including environmental benefits supply of LNG in port advantageous situation in Spain, which has seven regasification plants. ▶ The use of LNG in ships could represent 23% of maritime transport consumption in 2050 globally53. The renewable option in this case is biomethane. ▶ For small boats and short hauls fossil fuels could be replaced by electric motors. ▶ Currently the use of fuel cells for maritime transport is limited to demonstration projects on small ships but its feasibility analysis in large vessels is awaited. The use of LNG in ships could represent 23% of transport consumption shipping in 2050 globally. The renewable option in this case is biomethane. C.2.4 Challenges and opportunities The necessary change for the advanced decarbonization of transport and mobility systems by 2050 presents a series of challenges and opportunities. The most notable are listed. challenges ▶ For the General State Administration and the Autonomous Administrations. It is essential to coordinate the different initiatives to ensure homogeneous development at the national level set a clear course consumers (citizens and companies) when making their decisions. in addition it is necessary to define and progressively implement an environmental fiscal reform. ▶ For Local Entities and with a horizon of 2050 mobility needs and the existence of efficient public transport efficient 53 Global Energy and Climate Outlook 2018: Sectoral mitigation options towards a low-emissions economy JRC 2018 62ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION ▶ For industry. The automotive sector in Spain represents 10% of GDP and employs around 9% of the active population. It is a leading industry competitive and accustomed to moving in an environment of global challenges as it is an eminently exporting sector. To remain as a producer of 3% of the world car production and second European producing country54 must take into account the objectives and paths that are being marked both by our competitors Spanish-made vehicles. That is the best way to take advantage of the intense transformation process that the sector is experiencing on a global scale and build the zero-emission mobility path by 2050. The sector at European level has the challenge of not depending on Asian battery suppliers. an initiative Noteworthy in this area are the works already initiated by the European Commission in relation to the Alliance European Battery. ▶ At the training level It is necessary to adapt the training and teaching cycles to the new demands of the mobility industry. A specific study for the Spanish case by Cambridge Econometrics55 indicates that the job creation potential of the new mobility model will imply the creation of more than 23,000 jobs net in 2030. ▶ For companies given that recharging services in Spain are a liberalized activity transport involves the challenge of deploying an infrastructure for public use profitable if combined with others services with sufficient capillarity. The European Parliament has asked the Member States to 90% of the service stations located in the basic network of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) have fast electric charging points. In Spain This requirement will be included in the Law on Climate Change and Energy Transition. The challenge from 2030 will be to adapt said infrastructure to the features of the new models of electric vehicles with greater autonomy capabilities. further the energy efficiency in buildings directive56 recharge new and existing car parks. For public administrations it will be essential to coordinate the different initiatives to ensure a homogeneous development that sets a clear course for consumers (citizenship and companies) when making your decisions. ▶ For electrical system Promote investments in technologies for smart grids that enable simultaneous recharging of million vehicles. Demand and storage management while taking advantage of opportunities offered by self-consumption They will be essential to achieve the management of the fleet. ▶ The advanced biofuels sector faces challenges related to: The maturity of production technologies on a commercial scale. Considerable support is required for the I+D+i. The mobilization of sustainable raw materials for the manufacture of these products. 54 Annual Report 2018 ANFAC. 55 https://www.transportenvironment.org/sites/te/files/2018_07_FSF-Repostar-hacia-el-futuro_FINAL.pdf 56 Directive (EU) 2018/844 amending Directives 2010/31/EU energy efficiency. 63ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION ▶ The renewable gases sector will have to face challenges related to: The cost of production from renewable sources. Currently superior to extraction and processing of fossil fuels. The deficit of supply facilities to the end user. opportunities ▶ Industrial and economic. Opportunity to position the Spanish industry of vehicle manufacturers components and infrastructure alternative fuel refill before new national and international demands. Opportunities provided by renewable fuel manufacturing facilities for the reindustrialization in areas with greater needs for socioeconomic revitalization and generation of job contributing to rural development plans. Contribution to the circular economy concept: 1. Transformation of combustion vehicles or "retrofitting" mainly in the field of freight vehicles for which it will be necessary to advance in the homologation of said transformations at European level (hydrogen gas or electric). 2. Development of fuels from the use of waste without compromising the material recovery targets. 3. Promotion of the recycling industry and second life of batteries57. Attraction of European structural funds and the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the deployment of infrastructure for the supply of alternative fuels and for research in the development of zero and low emission technologies in the transport sector. The change will contribute to the development of the circular economy concept as much as I know refers to the transformation or readaptation of vehicles such as fuel development with waste utilization or the recycling industry. ▶ New business models Figure of the aggregator to manage the storage capacity of electric vehicles. Production of renewable hydrogen at competitive prices using renewable electrical energy. Disruptive change in mobility systems by 2050. The progressive implementation of mobility solutions smart and connected mobility will require alliances between companies from different sectors: energy telecommunications insurers of the vehicles which will allow optimizing the investment in their acquisition.

SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.3 SUSTAINABLE BUILDING The final consumption of energy in the building sector in Spain has less relative importance than in the average of the EU mainly due to climatic differences represents around 30% while in the whole of the EU accounts for 39%. Under the common denomination of buildings, two sectors of energy consumption are included with guidelines and different dynamics: ▶ Residential. This sector collects household consumption and represents around 18% of final energy. ▶ Services. Trade public administrations and they account for 13% of final energy consumption. C.3.1 Current situation Since 2000 the buildings sector in Spain has acquired more weight in the final energy demand of the increase registered in the second half of the last decade in which it increased about 6 percentage points The average consumption of Spanish buildings is 0 55 toe/year difference is largely explained by the more favorable weather in Spain as previously mentioned. For your part the evolution of direct CO emissions from the buildings sector (not including those derived from its consumption of 2 electricity) is shown in the following graph.

Due to the weather as commented previously. So the difference in the relative weight of the heating largely determines the intensity energy in the residential sector. Looking at energy sources around 60% of the energy demand of the residential sector is satisfied with direct use of various fossil and renewable fuels while electricity covers the remaining 40% of the demand. The predominance of fuels reflects the importance of thermal uses in this sector among them the heating where 43% of the demand of Spanish households is concentrated fossil fuels and renewable resources. 58 Intensity with climatic correction. 66ANNEX C.

SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION The high level of electricity consumption responds to the type of energy use as well as the sectoral composition of the sector. Specifically the needs of the office and retail sectors in terms of lighting office equipment information and communication technologies (ICT) The lower electricity consumption in the countries of central and northern Europe is largely due to a lower load of refrigeration and the increased use of cogeneration and district networks to cover their energy demands. C.3.1.3 Characteristics of the sector Some particularities of the building sector that are relevant for its decarbonisation are its diffuse nature and the high relative cost of the actions to be undertaken coupled with long payback periods. Contrary to occurs with sectors such as renewable electricity generation for the decarbonization of the building is not enough with an adequate regulatory framework but specific impulse measures are required to promote actions necessary. The decarbonisation of the building sector must begin first total. According to estimates of the European Commission 20% of the existing building stock in 2050 has not yet been built therefore, the adequate design and construction of new buildings plays a fundamental role. Nevertheless the The remaining 80% corresponds to buildings that already exist today Therefore, a comprehensive and ambitious approach is necessary action in the existing park. Once the reduction of energy needs has been addressed, it is necessary to undertake the decarbonisation of demands remaining. In the case of electricity it is expected that it will be free of emissions given the strong growth in generation renewable approaching 100% by 2050. The building sector important in the installation of new renewable electricity generation.

Decarbonization pathways To establish an adequate technological evolution in the long term (2050), two clearly defined periods must be considered. differentiated: a) Actions until 2030: Linked to the objectives of the PNIEC and marked by energy rehabilitation and renovation of existing thermal installations through development and optimization of technologies currently mature. These technologies include the following: renewable thermal heat recovery systems ventilation air and waste heat from other facilities demand management systems renewables on the grid (such as storage bidirectional charging points information etc.) and electrification of part of the thermal demand in buildings. b) Actions from 2030 to 2050: Marked by advances in research and development of new technologies and applications. In any case given the long useful life of the buildings and the relatively low rate of renovation compared to other sectors policies need to be aligned these can be done in a way that is compatible with a decarbonization scenario by 2050. Favorable taxation for zero carbon buildings it can be a useful tool for the decarbonisation of the sector. The PNIEC forecasts a significant reduction in consumption in the residential sector linked to the renewal of thermal installations in more than 300,000 homes/year and intervention on the thermal envelope of an average of 120,000 homes/year (1,200,000 homes in the period 2021-2030). C.3.3 Horizon 2030 The PNIEC forecasts a reduction in emissions from the residential and service sectors by 2030 mainly linked to policies energy efficiency whose reduction in consumption is mainly linked to the reduction in the use of fuels fossils. In the case of the residential sector the Plan provides for a significant reduction in consumption in the sector of thermal installations in more than 300,000 homes/year and intervention on the thermal envelope of an average of 120,000 homes/year (1,200,000 homes in the 2021-2030 period). The fulfillment of these objectives is supported what's more that increases the demands in saving and incorporation of renewable energies both in new buildings as in the integral rehabilitations of the same. Regarding the service sector actions are planned on the thermal envelope of lighting. The result: electricity maintains its share of around 60% of the sector's consumption until the middle of decade and increases towards the year 2030 consumption of renewables more than doubles (from less than 2% to more than 4% of the consumption of the sector). While the consumption of both natural gas and products petroleum products. 61 Examples: VERDE Building Assessment and Certification Tool E + C- (France). 71ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.3.4 Horizon 2050 C.3.4.1 New building Advances in architectural and construction techniques together with energy management systems in buildings the implementation of renewable thermal and electrical energies in buildings allow new buildings to be build have almost zero energy needs, especially in the use of air conditioning. On the other hand in Spain there are numerous climatic zones in which in all or the vast majority of cases achieve comfort conditions in the building with passive systems – this is disregarding the use of energy for the air conditioning –. In the sense described above of ensuring compatibility for a decarbonised scenario by 2050 in the In the coming years, the new building should anticipate optimal use of the surface for thermal and/or electrical use. of solar energy space reserves for electrical and/or thermal storage systems and reserves for channeling wiring and connections for self-consumption systems demand management or electric vehicle recharging. For this, normative tools such as the Technical Building Code and the Regulation of Thermal Installations of Buildings. In Spain there are numerous climatic zones in which all or the vast majority of cases, comfort conditions can be achieved in the building with passive systems - this is disregarding the use of energy for air conditioning –. Sustainable building criteria Once the reduction of consumption during use has been addressed it becomes relevant to act on the energy and emissions associated with the materials manufacturing its transportation and the construction process. Depending on the climatic zone and the type of building the complete life cycle of the building Embedded power can exceed power consumed during use of the building62. It is therefore necessary to contemplate accounting and reduction criteria in the regulations for new buildings. energy and environmental impact in the construction process itself. There are already various certification systems for environmental or sustainable construction that contemplate a life cycle analysis and specifically the analysis of emissions embedded. Several countries have databases to facilitate life cycle analysis for construction although for now it is about voluntary certifications. The only exception is the Netherlands where there is an obligation to calculate the environmental impact of materials63. The Eduardo Torroja Institute of Construction Sciences (CSIC) develops the OPENDAP64 database where I know collect Environmental Product Declarations that provide environmental information on the life cycle of the products of the construction. 62 Embodied Energy and Nearly Zero Energy Buildings: A Review in Residential Buildings: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316052639_Embo- died_Energy_and_Nearly_Zero_Energy_Buildings_A_Review_in_Residential_Buildings 63 Agencia Internacional de la Energía.

SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.3.4.2 Intervention in existing building. First the efficiency energetic Although it is in new buildings where the decarbonisation of the building sector can be tackled in a more complete and cost-effective as noted by buildings that already exist today so it is critical to act on them. Following the “first energy efficiency” the European Commission proposes energy efficiency in buildings as the first of the blocks of measures to undertake. In this way highlights the long-term strategy for the Energy Rehabilitation in the Building Sector in Spain whose update 2bis of Directive 2010/31/EU It was presented in June 202065 and measures in this sector. As it mentioned above to promote energy improvement actions in buildings is not enough with an adequate regulatory framework but specific impulse measures are necessary to move the holders of buildings to undertake such improvements. So they are needed: ▶ Funds to support energy efficiency measures and improvement of buildings prioritizing the actions aimed at residential buildings with vulnerable population among them Energy efficiency which must adapt its contributions and the type of eligible measures in coherence with the long-term Strategy; Housing Plans (such as the MITMA State Housing Plan 2018-2021) and Other measures in the General Budgets of the State and of the Autonomous Communities and Local Entities supported by a environmental taxation. These funds must promote both general actions to improve energy efficiency as well as singular projects that integrate a global vision and have a demonstrative effect. The deficit of supply facilities to the end user. The actions that are subsidized must be compatible with a decarbonisation scenario avoiding encourage actions with a short time frame. ▶ Mobilization of private resources both in the tertiary and residential sectors financial entities financing lines with public operators (ICO/BEI/IDAE) aid as a lever (conditioning or scoring certain aid to the existence of additional actions in efficiency) and through energy service companies or other financing systems that associate return on investment to energy savings. To promote energy improvement actions in buildings, it is not enough to have a adequate regulatory framework but specific measures are necessary to promote encourage the owners of the buildings to undertake said improvements. 65 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficient-buildings/long-term-renovation-strategies_en 73ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.3.4.2.1 The role of thermal installations Once the reduction of the energy needs of the building has been addressed particularly in air conditioning It is necessary to make decisions on the coverage of the remaining demands for domestic hot water and air conditioning in order to substitution of fossil fuels in the sector. It is interesting to assess the most efficient solutions at the neighborhood or district such as heat and cold networks (district heating with renewable energies). Although thermal installations in new buildings or to replace existing installations must be emission-free There are several technologies that respond to this requirement. with different characteristics: ▶ Heat pump (aerothermal geothermal and hydrothermal): allows to electrify the demand for both cold like heat. However currently not all existing air conditioning systems support a simple substitution. But it is foreseeable that the operating ranges of heat pumps will evolve and allow the use of conventional thermal installations for heat distribution. It is interesting to assess the most efficient solutions on a neighborhood or district scale like the heat and cold networks (district heating with renewable energies). ▶ Direct geothermal systems: greater efficiency by taking advantage of the low-temperature geothermal resource (70 - 100°C) directly without the need for a heat pump. However require a significant demand within walking distance of geothermal use. ▶ Solar thermal energy (heat and cold): greater efficiency by taking advantage of the resource directly, avoiding losses by intermediate steps of conversion into electricity although less versatile. ▶ Biomass installations: they achieve temperatures identical to those of fossil fuel boilers so they reduce the complexity of replacement in existing systems. The vast resource potential available in Spain must allow to guarantee both the saving of CO emissions and sustainability avoiding the impact on the 2 ecosystem and biodiversity. Presents the challenges of minimizing particulate emissions during operation obtain high yields and fuel storage. Although in rural areas it may have the added value of creating activity and environmental management associated with the use of the resource. ▶ Other renewable fuels: in a longer time horizon stack systems could be generalized of fuel destined for renewable fuels (such as hydrogen) or other systems adapted to gases renewable67. 66 Directive 2018/2001 indicates that biomass fuels will meet the sustainability and emission reduction criteria established by said directive when they are used in installations that produce heating and cooling with a power greater than 20 MW in case of com- solid fuels. Member States may apply this condition to lower powers. This condition must be met to contribute to the objectives and obligations and opt for aid. 67 Directive 2018/2001 indicates that biomass fuels will meet the sustainability and emission reduction criteria established by said directive when they are used in installations that produce heating and cooling with a power greater than 2 MW in the case of com- gaseous fuels derived from biomass. Member States may apply this condition to lower powers. This condition is necessary fulfill it to contribute to the objectives and obligations and qualify for aid. 74ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION Towards full electrification? The increase in electricity demand associated with the use of new equipment based on electricity presents as challenge high energy consumption and high demand peaks of consumption. Nevertheless this evolution will be accompanied evolution of self-consumption and storage coupled with demand management and flexibility sizing needs of the installations and the electrical connections of the buildings. The main efforts They should focus especially on multi-family residential buildings. The full electrification of thermal demands in the building sector presents the risk of reducing the possible options available to the consumer. Therefore, it is necessary to guarantee the development of a dynamic electricity market in which the consumer has the ability to choose and influence as indicated in the previous sections. But also analyze all the renewable heat and cold alternatives. Buildings can become demand-side distributed energy resources that directly or to through aggregators can offer services to the electrical system to facilitate the integration of renewables and maintain the network stability. This allows a more active role of the consumer in the energy system. In any case In order to move towards the electrification of demand, it is necessary to have price signals to facilitate appropriate decision making by consumers. Buildings can become distributed energy resources of energy management demands that directly or through aggregators electricity to facilitate the integration of renewables and maintain grid stability. C.3.4.2.2 Distributed generation. The building in the electrical system Buildings represent a fundamental axis of action in the incorporation of renewable energies into the electrical network. The promotion of self-consumption in particular and distributed generation in general have implications not only on the installation of renewable systems but also on the design configuration and use of the building. This scenario allows to overcome the vision of the city as an energy sink or even of the concept of a building “with almost zero energy consumption” going to “energy positive” buildings or districts namely share it with the rest of your built environment. The challenge lies not only in the implementation of new power but also in the systems that must be implemented to manage its energy production and demand in order to optimize the electrical system. further Installation of energy storage systems. Much of the equipment/technology that will facilitate this new approach needs to be installed in the buildings themselves What smart meters electric vehicle charging points in building car parks or energy storage systems individual or collective Neighbor communities energy communities and others). The building is part so of the building itself interacts and becomes a tool for managing the system as a whole through the management of distributed energy resources (generation accumulation and demand) that provide services to the system as a whole or to other users. Digitization in commercial and energy exchanges through technologies such as blockchain expansion of Big Data applications to energy management and marketing a key role so that the consumer can play that role. 75ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.3.5 Challenges and opportunities challenges ▶ Being a diffuse sector, it requires concerted actions that can mobilize decision-making by building owners. It is necessary to address in particular the improvement of the existing building. ▶ The sustainability of the building affects at least and local Therefore, adequate inter-administrative coordination is necessary. ▶ Together with the electrification it is necessary to promote the use of renewable energies for final use meet thermal demands. The sustainability of the building affects at least European state inter-administrative. opportunities ▶ The construction sector has been key in creating employment and wealth in Spain. Nevertheless has been focused mainly in new construction and has shown a cyclical behavior linked to the economic situation in every moment. The rehabilitation and reform of buildings allows us to refocus this sector and increase the quality and employment qualification. According to several studies It is estimated that for every million euros invested in rehabilitation energy are generated between 8 368 and 1869 jobs. ▶ Better monitoring of energy consumption in buildings thanks to digitization and greater accessibility of the data also allows greater awareness of energy needs and behavior patterns more efficient. ▶ Smart applications and the interaction between buildings and the power grid promote flexibility the resilience of the system and the capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change on the generation and distribution of Energy. ▶ The energy rehabilitation of the building can be coordinated with other improvements. The introduction of improvements structural of accessibility or the quality of the building stock can be used to improve efficiency energy and vice versa linking the best energy performance of buildings to a better quality of life. ▶ A greater and better use of biomass entails an increase in the management and improvement of forest masses and therefore a reduction in fire risk high savings in CO emissions as a result of the proximity 2 of the resource and derived economic effects in rural areas such as population fixation or better management of the territory. However it is important to keep in mind the emissions of particles so that progress in the technology does not affect people's health. 68 “Employment generation in energy rehabilitation and modernization of buildings and homes”.

Some characteristics of energy-intensive industry make it difficult to decarbonize the sector. For example the teams of primary production processes are characterized by high initial investment costs and are designed with a very long useful life for example up to 50 years in the case of cement plants. The industry has made numerous efforts in the past fundamentally derived from the very need to maintain its economic competitiveness (and therefore reduce the cost of energy and CO associated with its activity).

In order to achieve the planned long-term industrial decarbonisation objectives Several questions need to be answered related to each other: ▶ Estimate of the future level of industrial activity in Spain. ▶ What kind of materials will be used (and in particular the extent of recycling and reuse) its origin and guarantee of supply. ▶ What will be the energy vectors. ▶ What technological changes are foreseeable in the industry. These questions correspond to those raised by the European Commission to define its long-term vision based on the special report of the year 2018 of the IPCC that defines the measures at a global level to limit warming to 1 5°C.70 further the European Commission is conducting an assessment of critical raw materials. The profiles of the demand for these minerals will change significantly in the coming decades. Thus considering which ones to use scarcity and supply risks must be addressed as well as the volatility of the prices of critical raw materials and rare earths as they could hamper prospects for sustainability The sections below try to give a global vision of what the trends may be in these key aspects beginning with the possible evolution of productive activity continuing through the technological areas in which further progress is expected and due to the main challenges and opportunities that decarbonisation poses for the sector and by latest proposing the complementary economic instruments that could contribute to preserve the competitiveness of national and European industry. 70 The results of the report indicate that it is necessary to (i) reduce industrial demand (ii) improve energy efficiency energy demand (iv) reduce the carbon content of non-electric fuels and (v) implement innovative processes and the application of CO capture (CCUS). 2 78ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.4.2 Horizon 2050 C.4.2.1 Future evolution of the production of basic materials in Spain The analysis of the production of basic materials in Spain must be framed on the one hand of the production of said materials; and on the other in the influence of circular economy strategies. Global analysis is relevant as many of the raw materials are traded globally. In the baseline scenario of the European Commission energy consumption falls in all industrial sectors that are studied in detail (steel chemistry For the eight different scenarios that arise the path of production varies between a rise in demand of almost all raw materials in the reference scenario (REF) and a decrease of almost all of them in the most ambitious decarbonisation of the industry (achieves a 95% reduction in emissions). However In order to apply these estimates to the case of Spain, it is necessary to evaluate the situation in which it finds itself. Spain compared to the rest of European countries. For this, an analysis of per capita consumption has been carried out. (as well as the geographical extent relevant for example for infrastructure purposes). The results are presented in the following table compared with those obtained by studies on a European scale. As can be seen forecasts for Spain are broadly aligned with those of the European Commission. On Anyway it is necessary to remember that the level of production would be determined by national consumption for the corresponding imports and exports.

SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.4.2.2 Emission reduction strategies in the 2050 horizon Once the possible trends have been analyzed in terms of the level of consumption and national production of basic materials the next question is how needs can be met and at the same time decarbonize production processes. A comprehensive review of the academic and professional literature has been conducted as a result of which identified the main emission reduction options (the following figure presents these strategies grouped by some of the main sectors). Most of these reduction areas are relevant to more than one industry.

SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION The evolution of the industrial transition can be seen in the following figure which also shows the main lines of action in the industrial sector. FIGURE C.23 Sustainable and competitive industry Source: Technological Research Institute Quotation marks Next the main emission reduction potentials of each of the alternatives are described. C.4.2.2.1 Alternative raw materials (including reuse and recycling) It is about using raw materials that result in a reduction of GHG emissions throughout the life cycle of the product including the use of reused or recycled materials. In this regard the report prepared by Material Economics (2018)71 points out the economic and industrial potential of increasing the reuse of materials in Europe. In the case of steel for example Spain already has a high steel production capacity based on electric arc from Scrap In addition, there are still some barriers to using secondary steel in some applications. In the case of cement although the possibility to reuse and recycle is limited emissions significantly although new process designs may be necessary. In the industry of ceramic it is expected that new additives or small changes in the composition of the raw material will result in improvements incremental with respect to production emissions intensity. 71 “The circular economy.

SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION Said the above after exhausting the option of reuse and recycling feed production processes the criterion that should prevail harnessing the potential of domestic mineral resources under environmental and sustainability standards European countries that do not shift greenhouse gas emissions to other regions also contributing to the reduction of global emissions by reducing those of its transport. This will imply configuring a national policy for indigenous raw materials that guarantees that the resources are exploited in an economically viable and sustainable way using the best available techniques of emissions in the sector and reducing, as far as possible, the dependence on imports. It is necessary to set up a national policy for indigenous raw materials that guarantees that resources are exploited in an economically viable and sustainable way using the best available techniques ensuring the reduction of emissions in the sector and reducing the dependence on imports as much as possible. C.4.2.2.2 Reduction of energy intensity (improvement of efficiency) The fundamental ways to improve the energy efficiency of industrial processes In addition to equipment installation more efficient as both high temperature furnaces (over 500°C) or medium and low temperature furnaces (less 500 ° C) are heat recovery and cogeneration and efficiency. Regarding heat recovery the utilization of waste heat from high-temperature processes for other applications with a lower heat demand is not a new concept. In the sectors analyzed (iron and steel petrochemistry cement pulp and paper and the sector between 2 5% and 15%) like new heat exchangers. Regarding the cogeneration ceramics and food production are sectors with a high demand for heat and electricity so it is a viable option (as long as it is highly efficient and renewable). For the petrochemical sector it is assumed that there is already a high penetration of this technology making further reductions difficult to achieve. An additional challenge for cogeneration is to make it flexible to adapt to the electrical demand. C.4.2.2.3 Decarbonization of energy carriers The third line of action is the use of energy carriers without CO emissions to feed furnaces 2 for supplying process heat etc. Includes electrification (based on renewable sources) and hydrogen or more generally Power-to-X 82ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION Electrification: For the food and pulp and paper industries direct heat applications less than 500°C temperature are the main emitters of CO. Electrification is presented as one of the main alternatives for 2 reduce dependence on fossil fuels and it seems feasible to use a heat pump for temperatures below 200°C placing heat pumps in that temperature range before other technologies electromagnetic that could also have their application in these or other sectors. Since the temperature ranges in the pulp and paper sector are significantly higher than in the food sector electrification of existing equipment is less attractive for this sector. However high consumption rates fossil fuel for drying applications in the pulp and paper industry result in a theoretical potential higher than for the food sector. The electrification of the food industry is close to commercialization and many pilot projects are ongoing. Biomass: Biomass can play an important role in the decarbonization of the cement industry and in general for heat production above 200°C in other sectors. Can serve as fuel little pre-treatment. Regardless of the limits regarding the availability of biomass and the capacities production extension restrictions the use of internal waste streams of biological origin can play an important role in the decarbonisation of sectors with bio-based feedstock particularly in the industry food and pulp and paper. In any case it is necessary to take into account that biomass can lead to CO emissions 2 production and transportation in addition to particulate emissions. Biogas: Biogas can be an energy vector of interest since it presents advantages of calorific power and compatibility with current industrial processes. However its potential does not seem to be very high in a context of economy circular in which the priority would point to the reduction of waste generation. In any case You can find relevant niches for its use. Renewable Hydrogen and Power-to-X: The production of renewable hydrogen through electrolysis technology by reforming biogas or biochemical conversion of biomass can replace the use of fossil sources as fuel in many industrial production processes allowing to cover heat needs both at high temperature. Burning hydrogen does not emit CO as long as it has been produced from renewable energy sources. The challenge is the 2 energy intensity of its production process. in addition the use of hydrogen in the steel industry as a way to achieve a direct reduction of iron option to decarbonize that sector. Alternatively other energy carriers produced from electricity can also be considered renewable (Power-to-X). Although these vectors are commonly mentioned for their ability to store temporarily electric power could have a similar role to hydrogen economic competitiveness with that or other similar vectors. Other renewable energies: Other renewable energies in particular solar thermal (CSP) temperature to various industries being a viable alternative in the future. 83ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.4.2.2.4 Change of technological processes Achieving a significant reduction in emissions in industry requires to a large extent that separation methods Current thermal separation processes are replaced by mechanical separation processes (membranes). In comparison with the first membrane-based separation requires 90% less energy. Some specialized publications They consider that nano-membranes will be one of the keys to achieving the objectives of industrial decarbonisation. This new technology is still in the early stages of research. Current applications are limited by the low purities achieved. Membrane distillation (MD) or hybrid distillation (combination of membrane and distillation technology) show what for the separation of almost ideal substances such as processing in the petrochemical sector energy savings of up to 30% compared to distillation. The energy is used in the form of pressure instead of heat. The energy efficiency of lower temperature MD applications such as reverse osmosis can be improved if combined with heat recovery processes. Membrane applications are still in the pilot or laboratory phase. The available information does not allow quantifying the reduction potential for the sector as applications are too process specific of the different production routes. in addition electrochemical separation techniques such as electrolysis in combination with zero electricity emissions are presented as an alternative to the use of furnaces and is one of the most mentioned options for the steel industry. Achieve a significant reduction in emissions in industry largely specifies that current thermal separation methods are replaced by separation processes membrane mechanics They require 90% less energy. C.4.2.2.5 Capture carbon storage and utilization The use of CCUS technology has been extensively investigated for the sectors analyzed and Strategy for the Integration of Energy Systems (EU Strategy for Energy System Integration72) continues to be a milestone research and develop. In practice CCUS as an “end-of-pipe” solution only seems to have a viable clear in the cement industry the lime In the first three cases the use of CCUS may be the only option to eliminate process emissions. On Depending on the evolution of other alternatives, it may also be useful in the steel industry and refining73. In any case is The total redesign of the industrial process is necessary if the exhaust gases do not reach high levels of CO concentration. 2 High costs and unresolved issues related to storage or lack of realistic alternatives for sustainable utilization of carbon captured on a large scale have hindered and continue to hinder the commercialization of this technology. In the case of carbon capture in the cement sector which is one of the cheapest options additional energy costs for the capture represent up to 70% additional to the total production costs. What consequence Little progress has been seen to date in the introduction of CCUS on a large scale. The storage or use of CO in the manufacture of durable materials are alternatives that have to be 2 subject to long-term feasibility studies. There are currently preliminary analyzes of possible alternatives for storage carried out by the Geological and Mining Institute of Spain. At the level of uses in durable materials, it is not significant advances are expected for at least two decades. 72 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/energy_system_integration_strategy_.pdf 73 In the steel industry it will depend on whether hydrogen-based technologies advance sufficiently in which case the CCUS would not be necessary. In refining the CCUS may be of interest to On one side biomass. 84ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.4.3 Challenges and opportunities Five main conclusions are presented on the process of industrial decarbonization until 2050 emphasizing in the knowledge gaps that scientific-technical research should address. Process optimization with standardized equipment The main processes of the different energy-intensive industries (IIEs for its acronym in English) are made to measure for the manufacture of specific raw materials. The incremental improvements in the efficiency of the equipment of the processes as distillation columns specific to each sector. There are some cross-sectoral synergies of new equipment for low-temperature heating processes and processes auxiliaries. Equipment such as heat exchangers heat pumps or boilers (hybrid standardized for medium-low temperature ranges and can be an effective option to reduce carbon footprint of the entire industrial sector. Advances in areas such as heat recovery heat supply or process control will reduce the emissions in the early stages of decarbonization without the need to change the production routes of the sectors who currently use them. The improvement of efficiency and the electrification of thermal processes will be very important Although they also have limits. Electrification is feasible only for those processes that require low and medium operating temperatures. For your part It should be noted that cogeneration technologies (CHP) based on the use of fossil fuels lose leading role towards the future by generating CO emissions and not contributing to the efficiency of electricity generation in 2 almost 100% renewable and efficient scenarios. Advances in areas such as heat recovery supplying heat or controlling processes will reduce emissions in the early stages of decarbonization need to change the production routes of the sectors that currently use them. innovative technologies Optimizing current production processes is not enough to achieve planned mitigation goals in this Strategy. Innovations are needed in all energy-intensive sectors. Among others new technologies and innovative processes are needed for steel A possible answer could come from renewable hydrogen or Power-to-X as decarbonized energy vectors that do not require relevant transformations to be used for the generation of heat at high temperatures. If they could be generated transported and used massively (except for process emissions) although the cost of these technologies is still unknown. Electrolysis could allow the deep decarbonization of the steel industry. The electrification of the drying and of warming will be key for the pulp and paper industries food and glass. in the cement CCUS and alternative raw materials offer the highest emission reduction potentials. the new membranes carbon sequestration and the transformation of processes to obtain new fuels are mentioned as promising in the petrochemical industry. Specific the refining industry associated with the production of low-carbon fuels but it will have to transform the production processes through innovative technologies. A high proportion of biomass could be the solution for the ceramic sector. The Most of these solutions are industry specific and the technologies mentioned are not yet ready for the market. 85ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION A comparison of the emission reduction potential of new technologies in different sectors identifies four key areas (other than hydrogen use): new membrane technologies neutral steel production in carbon alternative materials to clinker in the cement industry based on maximum and minimum ranges.

Technological Research Institute Quotation marks Each of these technologies could reduce industrial emissions between 8% and up to more than 20% in the sectors analyzed. Nevertheless as already pointed out feasible. In fact carbon neutral steel production and membrane technology are in early stages of development research. in addition no alternative material for cement production is more competitive than clinker based on of limestone. For your part carbon sequestration has been implemented on a pilot scale uncertainty regarding storage make implementation difficult. The commercial viability of electrolysis could occur between 2030 and 2040. 86ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION Technology readiness and investment cycles The commercial viability of most of the technological options analyzed is not expected until after 2030. that context the speed with which existing installations are replaced by new technologies is a factor important for evaluating options for industrial decarbonization. A sector characterized by longevity of your process equipment. The replacement and renewal of existing process technologies depends on the remaining useful life of the installed equipment its operating costs and the expected costs for new technologies. The analysis presented shows that the innovations related to CCUS biomass and hydrogen often require redesign of production processes and will not be implemented accordingly short term. Auxiliary heat supply improvements only recovery and reuse of heat do not imply changes in the production system. The market penetration of new commercially competitive solutions in these areas will be carried out incrementally over a medium-term time horizon. The changes associated with the entire production system have a time horizon of 20 years. Some teams have an economic life of 40 to 50 years. If they are replaced today they will continue to operate until post-2050 if the costs of opportunity for alternative facilities do not justify premature replacement. This path dependence of the technologies must be considered in the refined formulation of specific policies aimed at decarbonization deep industrial by 2050. The decarbonisation of the industry should take place within the framework of a more wide that ensures the international competitiveness of the national and European sectors that are considered strategic combining support for innovation of certain sectors to minimize the negative effects on employment as it has been addressed in the Just Transition Strategy. Cross-sectoral implications of innovations In some cases mitigation options for the industrial sector require the development of external infrastructure. CCUS technology for example or realistic alternatives for the use of carbon in a lasting way. A) Yes it will be more likely to be economically feasible within industrial conglomerates with shared transport infrastructure than for isolated plants built in the vicinity of the sources and mines of their raw materials. The processes that use hydrogen tomorrow instead of fossil fuels will require the development of an economy based on it. Today the use of hydrogen is presented as an essential element of the decarbonization of industrial processes where previously CO capture and storage had dominated 2 the debate on the decarbonization of industries with few technological possibilities to reduce emissions such as the case of the cement sector. The very high costs of CO capture and the unanswered question of feasibility 2 from underground storage or durable use are as previously pointed out for the introduction of this technology. 87ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION In the evaluation of the sectoral roadmaps towards decarbonization that have been analyzed both the CCUS and the electrification or the hydrogen economy are considered system transformations. Electrified processes will only be carbon neutral if electricity is generated from renewable sources and this will generally require extension of a single existing system the electricity transmission or distribution network. For your part both the CCUS and the hydrogen economy will require new distribution systems and storage. Taking into account that both CCUS and hydrogen are alternatives that can contribute to decarbonisation while maintaining current production processes can be considered processes that enter into competence. The weight of the advantages and disadvantages of both technologies will decide their future implementation coexistence and competition. Finally It is necessary to reflect on a series of more transversal challenges: ▶ The decarbonization of industry should take place within the framework of a broader action that ensures the international competitiveness of national and European sectors considered strategic and that it must combine support for the innovation required for this competitiveness. ▶ AND on the other hand transition to minimize negative effects on employment As discussed in the Strategy for Just Transition. C.4.4 Economic instruments to guarantee the competitiveness of national and european industry It is essential to have elements to protect the competitiveness of national and European industry. In line with the “European Green Deal” the first option is border adjustments to impose a CO price on 2 imported products (according to their carbon intensity) and potentially reimbursing exports. On the other hand the development of green public procurement will help public administrations to control emissions embedded in the infrastructures or buildings they commission. To properly incentivize the entire value chain the purchase should be complemented by the inclusion of energy-intensive materials in European and national policies of circular economy. The development of green public procurement will help public administrations to control the emissions embedded in the infrastructures or buildings they commission. 88ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.5 NON-ENERGY DIFFUSE SECTORS Diffuse sectors are those not included in the European emission rights trading system, encompassing the transport the residential sector Within these sectors are those whose main emissions are not derived from the use of energy as they are: a) Agriculture which mainly emits NO due to the use of fertilizers 2 4 NO for enteric digestion and treatment of stools. 2 b) The treatment of waste that emits CH mainly due to the decomposition of organic matter. 4 c) Emissions due to leaks of refrigerant gases and other fluorinated gases. To the previous set of sectors and gases other than CO of fossil origin 2 its emissions are reported in CO equivalent according to the atmospheric warming potentials (GWP) of each 2 greenhouse gas. In the year 2018 the set of these sectors supposed for its acronym in English National Inventory Report) 18% of total national emissions. those of agriculture and livestock represented 12% waste management 4% and fluorinated gases 2%. On a European scale the situation of these sectors is very uneven to the different degrees of development and to the waste management model. Despite this disparity between Member States and as the following graph shows the percentage distribution of Spain is in the European average (EU28). FIGURE C.25 Distribution of non-energy emissions from diffuse sectors 2018 3% 12% 4% Spain 10% Europe 3% 2% agriculture farming Fluorinated Gases Fluorinated Gases 82% 82% Waste management Waste management Rest Rest Source: Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge based on Eurostat data and National GHG Emissions Inventory 89ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.5.1 Agricultural sector Greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector are mainly generated by livestock (enteric fermentation and manure management). They account for two thirds of total emissions. Other important contributor is soil management (includes the use of fertilizers) which represents a third of the total emissions. Other minority sectors are rice cultivation or urea fertilization. In 2018, emissions from this sector accounted for 39 6 million tons of COeq 2 (NIR 2020). The following figure presents the distribution of GHG emissions from agriculture-livestock between the different categories from according to the latest National Emissions Inventory. FIGURE C.26 Distribution of GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in 2018 0% 1% 0% enteric fermentation manure management 31% rice cultivation 45% Agricultural soils waste burning whitewashed 1% 22% Urea Source: Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge 2020 By type of gas, methane (CH) stands out from the livestock sector (enteric fermentation and management of 4 manures) and nitrous oxide (NO) 2 also manure management. The main parameters that affect the generation of emissions in the livestock sector are the number of cattle herd heads the type of cattle and their feeding produced. In the case of agriculture, the main factors are the amount of fertilizers applied to the soil. types of crops and their rotation. C.5.1.1 Current situation Regarding the evolution of emissions from this sector since 1990 stability is observed between the years 1990 and 1993 a growth pattern during 1994-2000 fluctuations. As of 2013, a change in the upward trend is observed linked to increased use of fertilizers inorganic and the increase in the cattle herd. 90ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION In the European framework Emissions from this sector represent 10% of the total and, in turn, show an upward trend since 2012. However Spain's upward trend is proportionally more pronounced than that of the EU.

For the period 2014-2020 the CAP includes as one of its main objectives "the sustainable management of natural resources and action for the climate" with special attention to emissions greenhouse gas The Biodiversity 74  https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Archive:Agri-environmental_indicator_-_greenhouse_gas_emissions#Total_emissions_ from_the_EU_agricultural_sector 92ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION Nowadays The Regulations for the next period of application of the CAP (2021- 2027) based on the legislative proposals made by the European Commission after the presentation of the Communication on “The future of food and agriculture”. In this new reform of the CAP the following are proposed three general objectives: a) The promotion of a smart agricultural sector resistant and diversified that guarantees food security. b) The intensification of care for the environment and action for the climate helping to achieve goals climate and environmental issues in the EU. c) Strengthening the socioeconomic fabric of rural areas. What's more among the specific objectives of the proposal for a Regulation on the Strategic Plans of the CAP elaborate all member states establishes that of “contributing to the mitigation of climate change and adaptation to its effects as well as sustainable energy”. further Member States are urged to coordinate the preparation of their National Strategic Plan for the CAP with the NECP 2021-2030 in such a way as to ensure full coherence between both plans. On the other hand of the CAP post 2020 should also take into account among other issues Biodiversity Strategy published by the European Commission in 2020 as core elements of the Green Deal. The promotion of a smart agricultural sector resistant and diversified caring for the environment and climate action and tissue strengthening socioeconomic of rural areas are part of the CAP reform objectives. C.5.1.2 Horizon 2030 The PNIEC 2021-2030 identifies a series of measures to reduce emissions in this sector that refer to fundamentally manure management in the livestock sector and soil management and the use of fertilizers in the agricultural and it is expected that they will be implemented both through the next CAP and through the development of other measures regulatory. Specifically, the measures identified refer to: ▶ Promotion of rotations in dryland herbaceous crops that include legumes and oilseeds and that replace cereal monoculture in order to increase the nitrogen content of the soils without resorting to nitrogen fertilization. ▶ Adjustment of the nitrogen supply to the needs of the crop developing a fertilization plan that takes into account account those needs in such a way that organic and inorganic fertilizers are used in the doses and moments adequate. ▶ Actions for manure management: frequent emptying of manure in pig housing; covering of slurry ponds; solid-liquid separation thereof; manufacture of compost from the solid fraction. A) Yes applying the measures identified in the PNIEC in 2030 they will be 29 9 million tons of COeq. 2 further the PNIEC proposes other measures related to the agricultural sector that are relevant both from the point of from the point of view of CO2 fixation and from the point of view of adaptation to climate change. Among other measures highlight the use of pruning remains from woody crops as biomass (whose emissions are accounted for in the sector waste) and actions to promote the role of the agricultural sector as a carbon sink conservation agriculture the maintenance of plant covers and the incorporation of pruning remains into the soil in crops woody (actions referred to in "Annex A. Natural Sinks" of this Strategy). 93ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.5.1.3 Horizon 2050 As highlighted in the European Commission Communication of November 2018 “A clean planet for all: Europe's long-term strategic vision for a prosperous economy modern in an emissions reduction scenario of 90% in 2050 compared to 1990 the emissions that will continue to exist will largely correspond to the agricultural sector due to its particularities and its lower potential for reduction of emissions compared to other sectors. In that sense on the horizon 2050 2050 compared to 2018. The implementation of additional measures to achieve greater reductions in the agricultural sector in 2050 Is subject to the evolution of certain agricultural and livestock technologies and practices as well as the consideration of some hypotheses. ▶ Livestock practices for manure management (fundamentally from pigs and cattle). ▶ Biogas production. ▶ Agricultural practices for crop management and soil conservation. ▶ Digitization and smart technologies for the larger-scale development of precision agriculture optimizing the management of supplies and especially ▶ Advances in relation to livestock feeding both through animal improvement aimed at obtaining of breeds with less methane-emitting digestions as well as the development of additives/complements in food of livestock so that the animals improve the digestibility of the food they eat and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. methane. ▶ Advances in the use of coated nitrogen fertilizers and with nitrification inhibitors to avoid losses and maximize the assimilation of the nitrogen provided by the crops. The hypotheses that are considered in this horizon to 2050 to achieve an additional reduction in emissions from the sector are the following: The increase of the surface for the promotion of rotations in dryland arable crops that include legume and oilseed and that replace the cereal monoculture. The optimization of the nitrogen contribution to the crop needs to the total fertilizable surface. The management and application of manure and slurry treatments that minimize the generation of emissions. The reduction of waste in the food chain for national consumption which would satisfy the demand with lower production and will have a downward impact on emissions from agricultural soils. Promotion of the Mediterranean diet. The application of these measures would make it possible to reduce emissions from this sector to approximately 16 million tons of COeq in 2050. 2 94ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION Said measures are aligned with the Communication of the European Commission. In said Communication it is pointed out that the development and implementation of mitigation measures in the agricultural sector to reduce the main sources of emission such as enteric fermentation from ruminants agricultural soil management and manure management are sufficient to achieve the Climate Neutrality Scenario. Thus proposes emerging initiatives that can add more reductions in the sector: the application of the circular economy to the agricultural sector including production sustainable biomass for use in the bioeconomy and in the energy sector which may promote a reduction in direct and indirect emissions. In addition It will be important to promote greater resilience of the agricultural sector to the impacts of climate change, which in many cases implies an increase in the CO fixation capacity of the sector. Among other 2 practices to achieve greater resilience highlight organic agriculture and livestock conservation agriculture extensive livestock systems and precision agriculture. Given that the sector in Spain is clearly an exporter the evolution of emissions will also be conditioned due to changes in foreign demand. Finally It is important to note that this sector natural sink through the ability of the soil and woody crops to fix carbon so that together with the forestry sector will play a key role in achieving an emission-neutral economy. In this way practices that promote carbon sequestration in woody crops and in the soil will be promoted being aware also of the benefits of these practices for adaptation to climate change and for fertility itself ground. The practices that allow the increase of organic carbon in soils are extensive since incorporation of plant residues and pruning remains to the ground such as the use of organic fertilizers together with the modification of the tillage techniques that prevent the oxidation of this carbon. the agricultural sector in addition to being a GHG emitter natural sink through the ability of the soil and woody crops to fix carbon so that an emission-neutral economy. C.5.1.4 Challenges and opportunities The agricultural sector in Spain is of great economic importance social best practices and techniques available and the evolution of certain technologies will allow the sector to be less and less emitter and also improve its capacity as a CO sink. New areas also represent an opportunity 2 from the bioeconomy approach where new business niches will be developed. further local renewable energies have a broad meaning in agricultural environments using renewable resources autochthonous both for the production of renewable electricity and renewable fuels. The implementation of the measures identified must be aligned with the next periods of application of the CAP and at the same time promote socioeconomic development of rural areas. Many of these measures are also essential for policies to adapt to the impacts of climate change in the sector itself and present numerous co-benefits environmental and social. Among the challenges of the agricultural and agri-food sector to contribute to climate neutrality of emissions in 2050 being Spain net exporter highlights the need to take into account new trends and consumer habits who demand food that is produced more sustainably and with a lower ecological footprint. It should be mentioned in this regard that Spain is within the European context organic food production highly compatible with national edapho-climatic conditions. 95ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.5.2 Waste and wastewater management Greenhouse gas emissions in the waste sector are categorized according to the different options of management to which they are subject: ▶ Landfill deposit. ▶ Biological treatment (composting and anaerobic digestion). ▶ Wastewater treatment (urban and industrial). In Spain the deposit of solid waste in landfills has been and continues to be the majority method of management what this category is the one that contributes the majority to the emissions of the sector (more than 75%). must be taken into account that the deposited waste decomposes for more than 30 years. Composting is an aerobic process where organic waste is treated in the presence of oxygen generating a stabilized product the compound nitrous (NO). 2 Anaerobic digestion or biomethanization in which the waste is treated in closed tanks In absence of oxygen. Biogas is obtained that can be used as fuel and a digestate or digestate of muddy consistency. East The treatment generates fewer emissions and the use of the currents (biogas and digestate) obtained is facilitated. in what Regarding the digestate, it is important to take into account the applicable regulations and the management associated with it (conditioning necessary transport Wastewater treatment covers both domestic and industrial being the first ones the most contribute to NO emissions from the entire waste chapter. In the Wastewater Treatment Plants 2 (WWTP) incorporates biomethanation for sludge treatment. Minor emissions also occur in activities such as incineration without energy recovery of hospital waste and sludge. In Spain the deposit of solid waste in landfills has been and continues to be the management majority Therefore, this category is the one that contributes the most to emissions from the sector (more than 75%). It must be taken into account that the residues deposited decompose for more than 30 years. C.5.2.1 Current situation In the year 2018 emissions from this sector reached 13 2 total gross emissions according to the latest edition of the Inventory (NIR 2020). The following figure shows the distribution of GHG emissions between the aforementioned categories for the year 2018 of according to data from the 2020 National Inventory. 96ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION FIGURE C.31 Distribution of emissions from the waste sector according to treatments 2018 18% 1% Deposit in landfills 5% Biological treatment of solid waste Incineration and burning of waste Wastewater treatment and discharge Others 77% Source: Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge 2020 By type of gas, methane (CH) stands out which represents 90% of the sector's emissions 4 deposit in landfills (77%) and to a lesser extent 2 represents 10% of emissions Mainly for wastewater treatment. Regarding waste management the regulations in force are Law 22/2011 of July 28 and the National Waste Framework Plan 2016-2022 that include the objectives of Directive 2008/98/EC Waste (DMR) on the horizon 2020. Work is currently being done on the transposition of the new directives that emanate from the EU circular economy package and that establish the objectives for 2030 and 2035: ▶ Directive 851/2018 that modifies the Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC and set a goal of 60% of municipal waste recycled by 2030 and 65% by 2035. It also establishes deadlines for compulsory separate collection of certain flows such as organic waste and textiles among others. ▶ Directive 850/2018, which modifies Directive 1999/31/EC on landfill and establishes a landfill target by 2035 less than 10% of the waste generated; what's more should move forward waste suitable for recycling or another type of recovery in particular municipal waste in landfills. ▶ Directive 2018/852/EC on packaging and packaging waste, which sets recycling targets for packaging a 2030 on a global basis of paper containers in the same period. Achieving these goals is the way to reduce emissions in the sector. In the last decade, the contribution of recycling biological treatments and incineration with energy use the situation is very far from the objectives proposed by the aforementioned directives for the 2030 horizon. Incineration involves the burning of biomass with other products with a higher energy content such as plastics with significant emissions of fossil CO with low energy use around 20%. In a future system of 2 renewable generation efficient and sustainable contribute since it involves GHG emissions with an extra cost of generation. Separation and recycling are considered the more sustainable pathways being able to remain fractions remainder or rejection for thermal uses in industries with high needs energy sources and possible CO capture systems. 2 97ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION Analyzing the sector from the European perspective the total generation of waste per capita in Spain was half of the European average EU28 (2 77 tons vs. 4 to treatment the percentage of discharges in Spain was 53 of recycling in Spain was 37 09% compared to the European average of 37 environment like Belgium Italy the 42 72%. These circumstances have led Spain to an increase in per capita emissions from the sector. The evolution seen in the following figure shows a downward trend since 2011 the European Union.

SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION C.5.2.2 Horizon 2030 The emission reduction foreseen in the PNIEC 2021-2030 for waste management derives from the assumption of the objectives of the European directives in the matter recently approved and the sustainable development goals to 2030 for food waste assuming the following hypotheses: in 2030 60% of organic waste will be collected separately for biological treatment. If of used paper and cardboard it is expected to achieve a selective collection of 85%. Regarding prevention/minimization and for all types of waste to the year 2010. Part of this reduction will correspond to food waste which will be reduced by half for each household members and 20% in production and supply chains. All these actions will be associated with reducing the amount of waste deposited in landfills from so that by 2030 it is expected that only 24% by weight will be dumped of all the waste generated. will also act on fugitive emissions from sealed landfills. A) Yes The measures proposed to reduce GHG emissions in waste management are focused on actions aimed to give a low-emission treatment to the organic fraction of the waste: ▶ Domestic or community composting and separate collection of biowaste destined for composting or biomethanation. Management of biogas to produce biomethane to replace natural gas of fossil origin. ▶ Reduction of food waste. ▶ Increase in separate paper collection used domestic cooking oil and textiles. ▶ Systems to prevent leaking biogas in sealed landfills. ▶ Use of pruning remains from woody crops as biomass. Under these conditions with the measures proposed by the PNIEC approximately 10 million tons of COeq. 2 The proposed measures to reduce GHG emissions in waste management focus on actions aimed at giving a low-emission treatment to the fraction organic waste. C.5.2.3 Horizon 2050 The available technologies that are currently mature or in an advanced stage of implementation are: ▶ Composting: Different techniques for the aerobic treatment of organic matter with different levels of control (forced aeration sensors the target population. Compost of interest for the soil is obtained. ▶ Anaerobic digestion or biodigestion: Organic matter is fermented in tanks where you can control input substrates and biodigestion conditions. Installations are increasingly controlled with sensors where retention times are optimized. Hydrolysis systems can improve methane production and obtaining a better digestate. Biogas is obtained and in some installations the system of Waste emissions Spain nitrification-denitrification to reduce the nitrogen content of the effluents. 99ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION ▶ Biogas capture: Improvement of the capture of biogas generated in landfills for use or burning in Torch. ▶ Upgrading: Biogas purification to eliminate unwanted components and concentrate methane (biomethane) for vehicular use or injection into the gas network. ▶ Behavior change: for the implementation of separation at source that makes it possible to recycle materials (paper cooking oil waste applicable to food waste both in the domestic sphere and in the industrial sector or the hostelry and to other material flows (paper ▶ Oxidative covers: Covers made of organic material that manage to oxidize the methane leaking from landfills. They are efficient and affordable. There are different typologies. ▶ Digitization: Control and support of the processes and measurements inherent to the different procedures (composting anaerobic digestion collection and use of biogas or generator identification. In addition to the technologies mentioned performances based on technologies that are now available could enter the scene in study phase or pilot project. ▶ Non-anaerobic landfills: Aeration of the discharge front in order to reduce emissions while the cell active is open. ▶ Circular economy: Changing the current linear model is a challenge that has already been addressed by the EU. The implementation of the actions will lead to an increase in recycling and secondary raw materials but also of the design modes of use and repairability in all sectors. In the Trend Scenario, the current state of technology and the objectives of the new European directives are considered. in terms of waste implemented at the national level and projecting until 2050. This scenario would be a continuation of the PNIEC and its measures. This implies that the hypotheses proposed in said Plan are maintained and the following are added considerations: Less waste will be generated and only 10% of municipal waste will go to landfill of the different treatments. What's more the discharge will have an increasingly lower content of organic matter. On Anyway those deposited in landfills from previous years continue to decompose and generate biogas. Composting and biomethanation of organic matter although to a lesser degree CH and NO emissions. By generalizing composting and biomethanization to the extent that the waste 4 2 organic is no longer deposited in landfill emissions from these processes will increase. In the Trend Scenario, the current state of the technology and the objectives of the new European directives on waste implemented at the national level and projecting until 2050. In this trend scenario, emissions from waste management would be reduced by 62% in 2050 compared to levels of 2018. 100ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION The Climate Neutrality Scenario In addition to the trend hypotheses It is estimated that NO emissions by 2050 will be halved as a result of the reduction 2 of the nitrogen load discharged into the riverbeds from the WWTP. This will be a consequence of the implementation of future European and national regulations on water quality that could require limits of discharge stricter in the future to the WWTP. What's more recovery of methane in industrial waters would allow these emissions to be reduced by 80% in 2050 compared to current levels. Waste that would be diverted to a more efficient treatment will no longer be incinerated. To this hypothesis will contribute the next regulation of plastics on which the EU is currently working and that will force certain quotas of recycled material in packaging and other products. Certain fuels derived from residues could be used in industries that capture CO. 2 The emissions corresponding to the decomposition of the waste stored in the landfill will continue to have place. The application of technologies that are still incipient to act on these remaining emissions is proposed. Is the case of the application of oxidative covers on the surface of landfills which could lead to oxidation of 60% of methane emissions. Increase in the catchment capacity of landfills from the year 2030 to reach 30% in 2040 and 2050. Continue to reduce the total amount of waste generated nationally. The application of these additional measures would make it possible to reduce emissions from this sector by 81% in 2050 in relation to to the year 2015. The actions derived from the implementation of the circular economy would mean an increase in recycling and materials secondary premiums that would translate into a reduction in emissions although they would affect the producing sectors in waste management. The actions derived from the implementation of the circular economy would represent a increased recycling and secondary raw materials that would result in a reduction of emissions although they would affect the producing sectors waste. C.5.2.4 Challenges and opportunities Comply with the waste management objectives emanating from the directives that will soon come into force and Increasing its ambition until 2050 to meet decarbonisation commitments are two important challenges. ▶ Currently there are technologies to treat bio-waste with low emissions composting biomethanization or mixed. Nevertheless separated from this type of waste is implanted both at a domestic and industrial level. ▶ It implies stopping taking a very significant amount of waste to landfill that is still managed by this way to treat them in recovery plants implement or condition. This requires generalizing separation at source for practically all waste generated as the only way to guarantee its recycling. 101ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION ▶ In addition it is necessary to reduce the amount of waste throughout the value chain (producers households). For this, it is necessary to promote the change of habits throughout the same without forgetting the previous phase of the design. This challenge is synergistic with those posed by the circular economy. ▶ By promoting biomethanation plus renewable biogas well they are interesting for their application to the soil as an amendment they are very bulky and you will need to plan its management so as not to condition the viability of anaerobic digestion. ▶ The incorporation of compost or digestate to the soils in an adequate way allows them to store permanent part of the organic carbon, improving the quality of the soil. in addition It presents an important challenge to promote changes in the behavior of citizens in terms of separation in situ of residues and in particular of the organic fraction. It is necessary to deploy a considerable effort to raise awareness So such as mobilizing local authorities to speed up collection and management policies. In any case represents an unbeatable opportunity to provide organic amendments to our soils and increase their organic carbon content which will make them more resilient to the impacts of climate change thus contributing to adaptation. An important challenge is to promote changes in the behavior of citizens in terms of on-site separation of waste and in particular of the organic fraction. It is necessary to unfold a remarkable effort to raise awareness as well as mobilizing local authorities to accelerate collection and management policies. C.5.3 Fluorinated Gases Emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases (HFCs) PFCs 6 3 equipment and the applications that use them mainly in the refrigeration and air conditioning sector which represent approximately 90% of these emissions. Other minority sectors where emissions are produced are: insulation foams technical and medical sprays fire fighting equipment and electrical equipment using SF. Emissions from 6 halocarbon production mainly HFC 23 as a by-product. In the year 2018 according to the National Emissions Inventory greenhouse were 6 3 million tons of COeq75. They represented the 1 2 greenhouse effect. The following graph represents the distribution of emissions by categories 75 This data is the sum of emissions from sub-sectors of the National Emissions Inventory: uses of products as substitutes for substances that deplete the ozone layer and use of SF in electrical equipment. 6 102ANNEX C.

It has been a consequence of the implementation of measures both at a European level (EU Regulation No. 517/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council from April 16, 2014 greenhouse effect and Directive 2006/40/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 17, 2006 emissions from air conditioning systems in motor vehicles) and at the national level (article 5 of the Law 16/2013 from October 29 and other tax and financial measures are adopted in which the Tax on Fluorinated Gases of Effect is approved Greenhouse). It should also be mentioned that 15 years ago there were 3 plants in Spain for the manufacture of fluorinated gases in whose production process they emitted HFC 23 (HFCs with a global warming potential (GWP) 14,800 times higher than CO) and in 2014 closed the last of them. 2 According to aggregated data from the European Environment Agency At European level, emissions of fluorinated gases in 2018 they were 88 million tons COeq that represent the 2 2 The trend in the EU has been a slow growth in its emissions as a result of the implementation of community regulations. This evolution contrasts with the situation in Spain where mainly as a result of national tax on said gases The transition towards alternative gases with low emission potential has been advanced. heating. The following graph shows the evolution of emissions since 2005 both at European and national level that the change in trend registered in Spain from 2014 can be visualized. Spain has in fact become a world reference in terms of mitigating fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions what has been highlighted in various international forums such as the United Nations Convention on Climate Change and the OECD. 103ANNEX C.

These measures are in line with the European gas reduction regulations, allowing at least the figures of mitigation of the planned phase down. On the other hand an increase in air conditioning options based on heat pump for cold and heat is expected by 2030 which will increase the demand for gases of this type. The PNIEC estimates emissions of 4 million tons of COeq in 2030. 2 Available technologies and decarbonization pathways Nowadays there are alternative technologies to fluorinated gases in most applications in commercial and industrial refrigeration vehicle air conditioning isolation. In the most important sectors in terms of the use of fluorinated gases commercial and industrial refrigeration and systems vehicle air conditioning there are mature alternatives with low or zero global warming potential based on well in the use of so-called natural refrigerants (CO Hydrocarbons or NH) 2 3 warming potential such as Hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs). ▶ In commercial refrigeration, the use of CO is becoming either as the only refrigerant or in systems 2 mixed combined with low GWP fluorinated refrigerants. 104ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION ▶ In industrial refrigeration, systems with NH are being implemented 3. ▶ Today all new car and van air conditioning systems use the refrigerant R1234 (an HFO with a GWP of 4). ▶ In other more minority sectors there are other alternative technologies: in the foam sector they use HFOs as foaming agents; in firefighting there are mixtures of gases based on the chemistry of fluorine of low PCA; and in technical aerosols other gases are being used as aerosol precursor for example 2 In the future, research will continue in the rest of the sectors in which there are still no alternatives: domestic air conditioning with hydrocarbons as a more predictable alternative; electrical equipment with SF in which you are working with 6 F-gas mixtures with GWP significantly lower than SF; medical sprays where they still exist 6 regulatory barriers and finally the refrigerated transport in which similar alternatives can be implemented to those implemented in commercial and industrial refrigeration. Emissions Spain C.5.3.3 Scenario 2050 According to a trending scenario emissions of fluorinated gases would be reduced by 71% by 2050 compared to levels current (2018). This scenario results from the emissions of those sectors where alternatives are not yet available. mature this is: refrigerated transport In the rest of the most important sectors in terms of the use of fluorinated gases such as commercial and industrial refrigeration and vehicle air conditioning systems There are currently mature alternatives with low or null potential for atmospheric warming described at the beginning of this point. The scenario with additional measures (Climate Neutrality Scenario) contemplates the implementation of alternatives mature in all sectors so that in 2050 there will only be emissions derived from those applications with long service life or in which alternative technologies have penetrated later. Currently the international safety standards impose certain restrictions that pose a barrier to the use of certain refrigerants alternatives such as hydrocarbons. It is expected that as time progresses risk they pose and the use of these alternative gases will be allowed. The implementation of the quota system of the aforementioned Regulation (EU) No. 517/2014 will also have been reinforced about gases fluorinated greenhouse currently under review. Specifically emissions due to domestic air conditioning insulation foams and electrical equipment from 0 5 million tons of CO2 eq A notable increase in heat pump-based devices is expected for the production of heat and cold both at the industrial as well as domestic. In the domestic air conditioning and electrical equipment sectors in 2050 there would be banks76 of fluorinated gases where fugitive emissions would occur because penetration of potential low or no potential alternatives is anticipated for after 2030 and have useful life periods of more than 20 years. A) Yes in the case of air conditioning equipment domestic (with a half-life of 15 years) the foreseeable alternative will be hydrocarbons. However high number of these teams (approximately 10 million) in 2050 there will still be a significant number that will continue using fluorinated refrigerants. 76 This data is the sum of emissions from sub-sectors of the National Emissions Inventory: uses of products as substitutes for substances that deplete the ozone layer and use of SF in electrical equipment. 6 105ANNEX C. SECTORAL DECARBONIZATION For your part in electrical equipment, the foreseeable alternative is the mixture of fluorinated gases with PCA between 10-20 times lower than SF. They are equipment with an average life between 25 and 30 years so there will also be a relevant number that 6 keep using SF in 2050. 6 A particular case is the insulation foams where alternatives already exist its long useful life (greater than 50 years) there will continue to be fugitive emissions as well as those associated with its end of life by the technical impossibility of recovering foaming gases from most insulation foams especially those used in building insulation. Industrial Security professional training refrigeration and air conditioning elimination of illicit use and trafficking of fluorinated gases and improvement of its management constitute challenges to be solved in the coming years. C.5.3.4 Challenges and opportunities The main challenges that have to be solved in the coming years are the following: ▶ Review of international standards on industrial safety in the refrigeration and refrigeration sector air conditioning particularly in the domestic air conditioning sector where barriers related to with these standards for the penetration of alternative technologies to fluorinated gases. ▶ Improvement of the training of professionals in alternative technologies to fluorinated gases since there is a lack of technicians with knowledge to handle them particularly in CO technology. 2 ▶ Digitization of refrigeration and air conditioning systems. Like other sectors, the management of all the information generated by refrigeration and air conditioning systems and its digitization will be important for improve the performance and efficiency of these systems. ▶ Eliminate the illicit use and trafficking of non-permitted fluorinated gases. ▶ Improve the management of these fluorinated gases once the equipment that uses them reaches the end of its life. The main opportunities are the following: ▶ The use of gases allows the development of technologies that allow the generation not only of cold but of electricity to be electrified. low and medium temperature heat. ▶ In the refrigeration and air conditioning sector the most important in terms of the use of these fluorinated gases take advantage of the technological change towards systems that use gases with low global warming potential and look for synergies to improve its energy efficiency thereby reducing its indirect greenhouse gas emissions greenhouse. An example is represented by the changes produced in supermarkets where, along with the change refrigerant with low heating potential from the refrigeration plant has been used to close the cabinets refrigerators, notably improving their energy efficiency. ▶ Likewise technological change in refrigeration associated with the cold chain of food distribution You will find synergies with other policies such as reducing food waste. ▶ The promotion of alternative technologies to fluorinated gases can generate employment and economic growth. To this respect According to data from the sector, refrigeration in Spain has gone from a growth of 7% to 15% in the last 3 years. ▶ Look for synergies with residential rehabilitation and thermal insulation of buildings. 106ANNEX D ANNEX C. SECTOR DECARBONIZATION IMPACT ANALYSIS ECONOMIC JOB AND ABOUT HEALTH 107ANNEX D. ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH D.1 INTRODUCTION On November 28, 2018 the European Commission presented the document “A Clean Planet for all”77 strategy to achieve a joint reduction of GHG emissions in the EU-28 in the long term. In the European framework of the elaboration of long-term strategies There is a commitment to incorporate Governance78 an impact assessment of the different socioeconomic aspects. The objective of this chapter is so much analyze the economic impact of net emissions in 2050. The aforementioned European document is accompanied by an exhaustive analysis79 in which an evaluation detailed description of the economic impacts associated with the different scenarios and degrees of ambition in reducing emissions. Of the eight scenarios presented only two of them achieve climate neutrality in 2050 (1.5TECH and 1.5LIFE scenarios). According to that study the economic impacts in terms of GDP E3ME80 model are between +1 occurs precisely in the scenarios in which climate neutrality is achieved in 2050 and are compatible with the objective from 1 5°C. The results obtained by the European Commission are similar to those obtained in another recent OECD study81 (2017). According to this work mitigation policies to achieve a climate neutrality scenario will have an impact positive for the advanced countries of the G20 (which are net importers of fossil fuels) and places it in an increase average GDP around 2 2% in 2050. All the studies coincide in highlighting the important economic opportunity that decarbonization especially for regions economically dependent on fossil fuels. For your part IRENA (2019) in its recent report82 “Transforming the energy system” places the average impacts on GDP for G20 countries around 2 5% additionally in 2050 thanks to mitigation policies to achieve the Paris Agreement. What's more within the EU is makes special mention of the countries of southern Europe that would be the most benefited by mitigation policies and for the projecting an increase of 9 4% compared to the trend scenario in 2050. The impacts obtained by IRENA are more positive than those obtained by the European Commission partly 2019-2050 while the European Commission focuses on the impacts in the period 2031-2050. 77 COM (2018) 773 final. 78 Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of December 11, 2018 on the governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action. 79 https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/docs/pages/com_2018_733_analysis_in_support_en_0.pdf 80 The European Commission study also presents the results of three models two of them give positive hits. However results with the GEM-E3 model show small but negative impacts which are located at -0 respectively. Nevertheless the report points out that the model is restrictive since it starts from an economy in equilibrium disabled in the initial situation and Thus productive are allocated to other alternative uses that are theoretically less productive. This hypothesis contrasts at least Spanish with high unemployment rates and idle financial resources. 81 https://www.oecd.org/env/investing-in-climate-investing-in-growth-9789264273528-en.htm 82 https://www.irena.org/publications/2019/Sep/Transforming-the-energy-system 108ANNEX D. ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH Establishing a comparison between the various studies mentioned is complex since the results are the result of different scenarios policies and hypotheses. What's more needs sensitivity analysis and constant updating of results through future reviews of the Strategy. Nevertheless All of them coincide in emphasizing the important economic opportunity that the decarbonization especially for regions economically dependent on fossil fuels. This chapter is structured as follows. First of all the considered scenarios are explained and a brief description of the methodologies used for the analysis. Later the estimate of associated investments is presented to the different scenarios as well as the impacts derived from the energy change positive in GDP employment and health. Finally D.2 SCENARIOS ANALYZED The economic impact study has been carried out by comparing a Trend Scenario (without policies from 2030) and a Target Scenario (the Climate Neutrality Scenario) which picks up the changes technological and behavioral changes that will be needed to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. Following the same work philosophy used by the European Commission in its roadmap the ELP Trend Scenario coincides until 2030 with the target scenario of the PNIEC. Namely in this Strategy in the year 2030 Trend as the Objective are based on compliance with the PNIEC. Therefore what is evaluated in this chapter is the additional effect of the policies necessary to decarbonize the economy in the period 2031-205083. As shown in Figure D.1 the evolution of gross GHG emissions in the Trend would follow a declining path but insufficient to reach climate neutrality in 2050. The Neutrality Scenario Climatica achieves a reduction in emissions of over 90% compared to 1990 levels.

In the case of impacts associated with PNIEC investments these are not they would continue in the 2031-2050 period since they end when the investments finish being executed Nevertheless and the change in the energy mix would continue after 2030. 109ANNEX D. ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH The economic impact of the Strategy depends on the Trend (economic) Scenario assumed in this study. Saying The scenario has been calibrated with the GDP growth path used by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation (MINECO) and it is the one that has also been used by the TIMES-Synergy model of MITECO to perform energy modelling. According to MINECO projections GDP continues to grow continuously in the period analyzed (+28% between 2031 and 2050) as can be seen in Figure D. 2. In those years (-10%) which implies a notable increase in productivity. With regard to energy prices and CO, they have been used 2 those recommended by the European Commission. FIGURE D.2 Forecast evolution of GDP 2015-2050 (2030=100) 140 130 120 110 100 90 80 70 2015  2020  2025  2030  2035  2040  2045  2050 Source: MINECO Achieve GHG emissions neutrality by 2050 while projecting the path of economic growth above shown implies a substantial change in all productive sectors of consumption. This leads to a significant reduction in energy consumption. especially fossil fuel results in a very significant decrease in imports of oil and gas. Figure D. 3 shows the reduction and transformation of final energy consumption in different time horizons. Assuming full compliance with the objectives of the PNIEC in the period 2017-2030 would reduce from 89 Mtoe to 79 Mtoe. Between 2031 and 2050 final energy consumption would be reduced to 69 Mtoe in 2050 in the Trend Scenario and at 60 Mtoe in the Climate Neutrality Scenario. On the other hand the percentage of renewables in final consumption would increase from 17% in 2017 to 42% in 2030 would come to represent 64% of final demand in the Baseline Scenario and 97% in the Neutrality Scenario Climate. As can be seen in the 2031-2050 period, energy saving and efficiency would show a greater utilization in all sectors at the same time that renewable energies would increase their participation in the final energy consumption. 84 Chapter 2 of this document shows more detailed information on energy consumption. 110ANNEX D.

The impact analysis that has been carried out in this study is integrated (establishes relations between energy and economy in a consistent way) multisectoral (includes all economic sectors) and multidimensional (including other dimensions such as health effects). Figure D. 4 shows a diagram of the methodology used. as the picture shows The process has used output information or "outputs" of the TIMES-Synergy model of MITECO specifically energy balances and prices of energy have been used as "inputs" or input information in the DENIO economic model. Along with this information has also been included as "input" the flow of investments by sector and the additional costs of mitigating sectors that are difficult to decarbonise. This set of information has made it possible to estimate the economic impacts through of the DENIO model. On the other hand MITECO's Inventory Unit has incorporated the energy balance data from the TIMES- Synergy to estimate the emission of atmospheric pollutants associated with each of the scenarios. This information is the which has been used in the TM5-FASST model to estimate health co-benefits. 111ANNEX D. ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH FIGURE D.4 Methodology.

Also included are those of agriculture and those of the rest of diffuse non-energy sectors as well as those associated with technological change achieve hydrogen production levels synthetic and carbon capture fuels by 2050. Achieving climate neutrality will require additional investment in all sectors. It is estimated that total investments85 accumulated in the period 2031-2050 will reach 500,000 million of which 300,000 are considered additional as consequence of the implementation of this Strategy. Annual additional investments are around 1% of GDP in line with the figures presented by the European Long-Term Strategy 2050. 85 Total Investments as well as the study of the European Long-Term Strategy 2050 private postage. 112ANNEX D.

ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH In addition to increased energy productivity another very important impact as a result of decarbonization of the economy is the reduction of the energy bill due to imports of fossil fuels. In the case of Spain Currently, almost all fossil energy consumption is imported. In the Climate Neutrality Scenario of this strategy the reduction in imported fossil fuels is very substantial which will be very positive for the trade balance. Figure D. 7 shows the evolution of said import includes charcoal established by the European Commission to 2050. The bill associated with the importation of fossil fuels would go from €40,000 million in 2031 to €32,000 € million in 2050 in the Baseline Scenario and €7,600 million in the Climate Neutrality Scenario. Yes We compare both scenarios the additional savings accumulated87 in the period 2031-2050 in imports of fossil fuels would amount to €277,000 million.

The results are determined by three main effects. First of all by the positive effect generated by the additional investment flows that are necessary to reach the climate neutrality in 2050. These investments as already shown in Figure D. 5 relative to GDP and Thus Secondly by the effect caused by the change in the energy system. This change has a positive effect on the macroeconomic indicators on the one hand more efficient. For another for having an energy mix less dependent on imported fossil fuels These are almost completely replaced by renewable energies with a greater generation of national added value. The effect of the change in the energy system is more positive towards 2050 when policies make it shrink every time plus energy consumption while the prices of fossil fuels are getting higher. Finally due to the negative effect derived from the additional costs of mitigation in the sectors of difficult decarbonization or “hard” sectors like cement sources88 affirm that it is technically feasible to decarbonize them but that the necessary technologies will be more expensive than the fossil alternatives that we currently know (ETC 2018). In any case the solutions proposed to completely decarbonize these “hard” sectors will have to be global o There will be special protection measures for the industry (eg border adjustments) and Thus there will be no loss of competitiveness abroad. However mitigation will increase your production costs vs. to fossil alternatives and Thus which will mean a loss of purchasing power and a negative impact on the economy. These surcharges range from €600 million in 2031 to €3.7 billion in 2050 which supposes an impact of 0 respectively. 88 ETC (2018) Mission possible: reaching a net-zero carbon emissions from harder-to-abate sector by mid-century http://www.energy-transitions.org/sites/default/files/ETC_MissionPossible_FullReport.pdf 115ANNEX D.

GDP in 2050 in the Neutrality Scenario Climate would be 2% higher89 than in the Trend which represents an increase between 32,000 and 42,000 million (average of € 37,000 million). The effect of GDP growth is explained by the effect of the three channels mentioned: additional investments change of energy system and mitigation cost overruns in the “hard” sectors (Figure D. 10). The results show that the effect main dominant at the beginning of the period is due to investments90 while towards the end of the period the change in the energy system becomes the main engine of growth. The effect of the investments is maintained as long as they are executed Nevertheless It can be observed that mitigation cost overruns have a negative and growing impact towards 2050 but compared to other effects is very small.

Nevertheless the rebound effect for such high levels of decarbonization on GHG emissions will be reduced. 90 Private investments are not considered to generate crowding-out effects. In an extreme case where that investment is considered to be displaces 100% of other investments the additionality would disappear and 116ANNEX D. ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH Regarding the impact on employment the number of employed persons would increase by a range estimated between 250,000 and 350,000 people in 2050 which is an increase of 1 As in the case of GDP the impact on employment is mainly due to the effect of investments and the change in the energy system. In this case growth moderates at the end of the period due to the sustained increase in labor productivity which implies a lower number of jobs per unit of GDP generated. Again of mitigation cost overruns in “hard” sectors has a negative but moderate impact on employment at the end of 2050.

Although revenue from fossil fuel taxes declines over time the recaudation total increases as a result of greater economic growth all this without modifying the tax rates and maintaining the budget balance. In fact and as shown in Figure D. 12 Public Administrations would be more than sufficient to cover the public resources91 destined to finance the actions of the Strategy.

The reduction of GHG emissions has positive effects on public health since which also manages to reduce emissions of atmospheric pollutants often associated with them Productive processes and the existing synergies between climate policies and air quality control policies. The atmospheric pollutants that produce the greatest effects are fine particles (PM2.5) NO and ozone 2 tropospheric (O). PM2.5 is the leading cause of premature death due to poor air quality provoking 3 problems in the respiratory systems (lung cancer) cardiovascular or cerebral (ischemic attacks). As soon as to tropospheric ozone (O) although it is usually associated with damage to agricultural systems 3 significant negative health effects mainly respiratory diseases. The concentration of these polluting agents depends largely on the primary emissions derived from the activity economical of the interaction between them and their transport on a spatial scale. The main air pollutants are particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) whose main emission source is biomass92 and nitrous oxides (NO) x The main emission source is the transport sector and industrial processes. In Spain according to the World Health Organization93 (WHO caused by air pollution reached 14,042. According to the PNIEC, these premature deaths will be reduced to around 6,500 premature deaths in 2030.

This reduction is also consistent with current regulations (EU Directive 2016/2284) which requires that primary PM2.5 emissions must be less than 50% of the value of the year 2010. 93 http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/276772/Economic-cost-health-impact-air-pollution-en.pdf 118ANNEX D. ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH Figure D. 13 shows the variation of the main atmospheric pollutants between the Target Scenario with with respect to the Trend in 2050. As can be seen SO emissions 2 x and 36% respectively. The rest of the emissions are also reduced pollutants need additional and specific measures for pollution control not directly associated with GHG mitigation. These reductions entail a reduction in damage to public health. that have been calculated through the deaths premature deaths derived from contamination using the TM5-FASST model in Spain. This model allows capturing precisely how reducing emissions causes a reduction in concentrations. number of premature deaths from poor air quality using integrated exposure-response functions (Burnett et al. 2014). In this way the slight population growth estimated by the INE for the period 2031-2050 has been considered and that pollution damage does not follow a linear path with respect to emissions and concentrations since this It depends on each cause of death. The total effect of both considerations is that to reduce one unit of damage over health it is necessary to reduce polluting emissions to a greater extent.

Although there are many elements and parameters used in modeling the impact of the Strategy For this case, two have been chosen. factors about which there is greater uncertainty: 1) the prices of electricity in a 100% renewable system and 2) the Mitigation cost overruns in “hard” or difficult to decarbonize sectors. Next The different assumptions that have been assumed are presented: Electricity price: to capture the uncertainty regarding the future reduction of the costs of renewables or those of storage and that will determine the electricity prices of a 100% renewable system It has been chosen as uncertainty range the maximum variation used in the roadmap of the European Commission which is 25%. In this analysis, we modify so to center stage. Extra cost of the “hard” sectors: the mitigation costs are those used in the ETC report (2018) that offers a range per sector. In the central scenario, it has been assumed that the cost overruns are reduced from the maximum range of the ETC report (2018) in 2030 to a minimum in 2050. In the alternative scenarios two options arise. The first the high cost option where they are not reduced with time. The second costs are reduced by 25% by 2050. The mitigation costs95 of the hard sectors in 2050 would exceed 3,700 million euros on center stage €2.3 billion in the low-cost scenario and €4.9 billion in the high cost. 94 The sensitivity analysis has been carried out only on the economic model DENIO but not on the TIMES-Synergy model. 95 The implicit costs of CO in these sectors would go from €118/tCO in 2031 to €80/tCO in 2050 in the central scenario at €106/tCO in the 2 2 2 2 high-cost scenario and €50/tCO in the low-cost scenario. 2 120ANNEX D. ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH Figure D.16 and Figure D.17 show the results of the sensitivity analysis on GDP and net employment in 2050 respectively. Both figures show the results of the analysis separated by source of uncertainty and also the combination of all of them (global sensitivity). In the case of electricity the higher the electricity prices, the lower the increase in GDP and job creation since energy savings and the possibility of using these resources for other expenses are reduced. Sensitivity analysis shows a variation in the net creation of between 260,000 and 337,000 jobs. In the case of mitigation cost overruns in “hard” sectors the greater these surcharges GDP and employment generated since the prices of the products increase more and the spending capacity is reduced. The analysis of Sensitivity shows a variation in net job creation between 293,000 and 353,000 jobs. FIGURE D.16 Sensitivity analysis on GDP in 2050 target scenario with respect to the trend (M€) 45.000 40.000 35.000 25.000 15.000 10.000 High rank 5.000 Low Range 0 Scenario Sensitivity Sensitivity Sensitivity Central Electricity Surcharges Global Source: Basque Center for Climate Change FIGURE D.17 Sensitivity analysis on employment in 2050 target scenario vs. Trend (thousands of jobs) 400 350 300 250 150 100 High rank 50 Low Range 0 Scenario Sensitivity Sensitivity Sensitivity Central Electricity Surcharges Global Source: Basque Center for Climate Change 121ANNEX D. ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH The global sensitivity analysis96 shows the sensitivity of GDP and employment to changes in the 2 factors analyzed from joint way. The results show that the total number of additional jobs generated would fluctuate between 253,000 (scenario with high electricity prices and high mitigation costs in hard sectors) and 344,000 jobs (low prices of electricity and low mitigation costs in hard sectors). Thus in the conclusions section the impacts macroeconomic the impact on employment will be between 250,000 and 350,000 jobs in 2050 and on GDP between 33,000 and 41,000 million euros. D.7 CONCLUSIONS Recent OECD studies (2017) the European Commission (2018) or IRENA (2019) agree in identifying impacts positive economic benefits associated with climate neutrality in 2050. These studies indicate that the countries that benefit most by decarbonization will be those with the greatest dependence on fossil fuels and with the greatest potential for use of renewable energies. The objective of this chapter has been to analyze the economic impact and for the health of the “Long-Term Strategy for a Modern Spanish Economy Competitively and climate neutral in 2050” by comparing a baseline scenario (no additional policies from 2030 onwards apart from those contained in the PNIEC) and the objective scenario (Climate Neutrality Scenario) that includes the measures to achieve neutrality in 2050. According to the analysis carried out, the following can be concluded: First of all achieving climate neutrality implies an almost complete reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels that are replaced by renewable energies. The reduction in the importation of fossil fuels represents a saving accumulated for the Spanish economy in the period 2031-2050 of €277,000 million. Secondly achieving climate neutrality will require additional investment in all sectors. It is estimated that the total investments accumulated in the period 2031-2050 will reach 500,000 million of which 300,000 are considered additional as a consequence of the implementation of this Strategy. Additional annual investments around 1% of GDP in line with the figures presented by the European Long-Term Strategy 2050. In third place the macroeconomic impacts analyzed are positive. GDP will increase by around 2% in 2050 with with respect to the Baseline Scenario result similar to that obtained by the OECD (2017) the EC (2018) in the neighborhood of 1 between €33 billion and €41 billion in 2050 which will make it possible to finance the necessary public investments and generate resources additional for Public Administrations. Achieving climate neutrality implies an almost complete reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels that are replaced by renewable energies. The reduction in importation of fossil fuels represents an accumulated saving for the Spanish economy in the period 2031-2050 of €277,000 million. In fourth place and as a result of the economic expansion with respect to the Baseline Scenario which will mean an increase of around 1 In fifth place the co-benefits associated with decarbonization substantially reduce pollutant emissions atmospheric and health damage. Premature deaths in 2050 would be reduced by 22% compared to 2030 which would mean a reduction of 64% with respect to the 2010 values. 96 To carry out this analysis, 9 scenarios have been simulated as a result of combining the three ranges of uncertainty (high medium and low) and both selected factors (price of electricity and cost overruns in the “hard” sectors). 122ANNEX D. ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH In fifth place the co-benefits associated with decarbonization substantially reduce pollutant emissions atmospheric and health damage. Premature deaths in 2050 would be reduced by 22% compared to 2030 which would mean a reduction of 64% with respect to the 2010 values. Finally and as a final conclusion PNIEC for the period 2021-2030 will continue in the 2031-2050 period of the Strategy. Saving and energy efficiency renewable energies and solutions for sectors that are difficult to decarbonize will continue to be engines of new economic activity and job creation provided that these opportunities are taken advantage of conveniently. D.8 MODELS USED IN ANNEX D This methodological annex contains a brief description of the DENIO and TM5-FASST models used in the study of the “ANNEX D. ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH”97. D.8.1 Description of the DENIO model The DENIO model (Dynamic Neo-Keynesian Input-Output Econometric Model for Spain) is a dynamic model neo-keynesian econometrics. DENIO is a hybrid model between an econometric input-output model and a computable general equilibrium (CGE). In the long run the model works similarly to a CGE model. but it has the advantage of allowing an adjustment path towards equilibrium to be explicitly described. DENIO is developed from del modelo FIDELIO (Fully Interregional Dynamic Econometric Long-term Input-Output Model) de la Comisión Europea (Kratena et al. 2013 The DENIO model has a high disaggregation to 74 sectors 88 products of consumption and allows analysis of the economic impacts on key variables such as employment el PIB income distribution. The model is flexible and is designed to analyze the economic impact of public policies and economic measures energetic The DENIO model has a high disaggregation to 74 sectors 88 products types of households and 16 consumption categories and allows the analysis of the economic impacts on key variables such as employment el PIB The Input-Output core of the model is based on the Origin and Destination tables for the year 2014 (latest available) prepared by the National Statistics Institute. The production model links the production structures (Leontief technologies) of the sectors and products to a Translog model with four factors of production (capital job intermediate inputs). The energy factor demand is divided into 25 types which in turn are linked to the model in units physical (Terajoules and tons of CO). The set of energy categories of the energy substitution model is linked 2 directly with two parts of the model: (i) the physical accounts (Terajoules) of energy by sector and type of energy from EUROSTAT and (ii) the energy products and industries of the tables of origin and destination in monetary units. For For this, a series of implicit prices are used that link energy use/production in physical units (TJ) and in terms monetary. 97 A more detailed description of these methodologies can be found in the economic impact study of the PNIEC 2021-2030: https://www.miteco.gob.es/es/prensa/informesocioeconomicopnieccompleto_tcm30-508411.pdf 123ANNEX D. ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH D.8.2 Description of the TM5-FASST model TM5-FASST is a global air quality source-sink model (AQ-SRM) developed by the Joint Research Center (JRC) of the European Commission in Ispra Italy. TM5-FASST allows to analyze the effects in terms of health or damage ecosystems derived from different emission scenarios or pathways. Through meteorological or chemical information atmospheric the model analyzes how emissions from a given source affect different receptors (in cells) in terms of concentration exposure and model can be found in Van Dingenen et al. 2018. This model has been used to carry out different studies on global or regional level among which are found (Kitous et al. 2017) o (Markandya et al. by institutions such as the OECD to project to future (OECD 2016). The concentration levels of a given pollutant are calculated by means of coefficients that represent the different relationships between sources and sinks/cells. Although the model covers the entire world using cells of 1°x1° (~100 km) this process was performed for 56 regions (Van Dingenen et al. The model allows capturing that the gases emitted in a certain source "x" can affect different receptors and at the same time Precursor gas can also indirectly affect the concentration levels of more than one pollutant. For example NO emissions (which is a precursor gas) affect not only the formation of PM2.5 particles in the atmosphere otherwise x which also influence ozone (O) levels. Once the concentration levels of the pollutants the 3 model allows to analyze different effects derived from these levels such as the health impacts of pollution or possible damage to agricultural systems. TM5-FASST allows to analyze the effects in terms of health or derived ecosystem damage of different scenarios or emissions paths. In the case of health the concentration levels of fine particles (PM2.5) and ozone are the most relevant. these effects are calculated as premature deaths derived from exposure to said pollutants, taking into account the different causes defined in Forouzanfar et al. 2016a strokes or lung cancer. The parameters and the calculation of premature deaths due to disease are detailed in Burnett et al. 2014. 124ANNEX D.

PROPOSED SCENARIO FOR CLIMATE NEUTRALITY E.1 INTRODUCTION This Annex shows the results obtained after applying the measures of the document that lead to the decarbonization of the Spanish economy by the year 2050. The analytical base includes the policies and measures presented in the rest of the document. What's more the portfolio of new technologies available to meet the objective of decarbonization by 2050. This goal implies that emissions from all energy and non-energy sectors are equal to the sinks that will be available in that year. The assumptions included in the modeling exercise correspond to the recommended parameters provided by the European Commission in the framework of the preparation of the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan in order to ensure full consistency with it. So this exercise does not consider the impact of COVID-19. The high reduction of emissions in the year 2050 with respect to the current level which will mean a reduction of around at 90% from 1990 levels It is challenging in many ways. On the one hand the present heavily dependent on oil source. On the other hand as it has been collected in the epigraphs of this document available technologies for decarbonization that are commercially developed and can replace technologies conventional. Finally current levels of energy consumption imply a high number of emissions reduce this demand decoupling emissions from the notion of development. This decrease in energy used is addressed mainly through two ways. First of all through a deepening of the implementation of policies of energy efficiency and further behavioral changes are necessary for the transformation of the energy system towards decarbonization An evolution towards more sustainable mobility patterns are perhaps the most obvious and These behavioral changes are one of the necessary factors to achieve climate neutrality. Definitely climate neutrality entails a paradigm shift in the entire economic and social system. the grouping of these changes has been transferred to the energy model to have an estimate of the sectoral efforts and the portfolios technologies necessary for decarbonization with the aim of reducing global warming. Current levels of energy consumption imply a high number of emissions so it is crucial to reduce this demand growth. In order to address all the necessary changes in this financial year, carbon-neutral technologies have been introduced in those sectors in which sufficient development is expected before the year 2050. Based on a sectoral breakdown on In some cases, there is a portfolio of carbon-neutral technologies that will have a degree of sectoral use according to their cost and performance characteristics. One of the most obvious examples is the electrical system in which present A broad portfolio of carbon-neutral technology solutions is already available. in other sectors technologies have been included. a degree of development sufficient for them to be available on a commercial scale. In other cases It has not been possible to find a technological solution that completely decarbonizes the sector. These emissions remnants will be so 2050 has meant solving a series of sectoral challenges. In this exercise in some sectors available for decarbonization have a narrow portfolio of choice. In any case the evolution of research and development will determine the final decarbonization route in the future. 127ANNEX E. PROPOSED SCENARIO FOR CLIMATE NEUTRALITY This exercise has been carried out with the state of the art available along with its expected evolution the possibility that new technologies not considered here may be developed in the future O well determine a participation in the productive system other than the one contained in this document. E.2 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PNIEC AND THE ELP The models used for the exercise of the ELP are the same that have been used in the elaboration of the PNIEC. The only difference is the time horizons given that the PNIEC finalizes its estimates in the year 2030 projects the evolution of greenhouse gas emissions until the year 2050. The main virtue that is extracted from using the same analytical base is the total coherence between the ELP and the PNIEC. It exposed Below are the different scenarios that exist in the two documents: FIGURE E.17 Diagram of the scenarios analyzed in the PNIEC and in the ELP Source: Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge 2020 The PNIEC analyzes a trend scenario and an objective one: ▶ PNIEC 2030 Trend Scenario: this scenario represents the foreseeable evolution of the Spanish economy in the event that the policies and measures included in the PNIEC are not put into practice. It only takes into account the policies and measures approved until December 31, 2019. ▶ PNIEC 2030 Objective Scenario: This scenario represents the trend once the year 2030 is over. That is, which is the trend scenario of the ELP. Therefore would take into account the policies and measures provided for in the Plan and that will be launched until December 31, 2030. This scenario achieves a 23% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. However does not meet the goal of climate neutrality by 2050 implement the additional policies and measures included in this document and covering the decades 2030-2040 and 2040-2050. in the ELP analogously Trend from 2030 is a continuation of the PNIEC target scenario since compliance is assumed. ▶ ELP 2050 Trend Scenario hereinafter referred to as the Trend Scenario. as mentioned previously This scenario is the objective scenario of the PNIEC extended until 2050 and does not meet the objective of climate neutrality. ▶ Target Scenario ELP 2050 referred to hereinafter It includes all the policies and measures necessary to achieve the goal of climate neutrality by 2050. 128ANNEX E. PROPOSED SCENARIO FOR CLIMATE NEUTRALITY E.3 MODELS USED IN THE ELP As previously stated the models used for the development of the analytical base of the ELP have been the same as those used for the PNIEC (to see more detail about the models used in the impact analysis see ANNEX D section D.8). Therefore what is contained in the corresponding annex of the National Plan is applicable Integrated Energy and Climate with the following exceptions: The time horizon analyzed has been extended to 2050 instead of until 2030, which is up to where he analyzes the PNIEC. The technologies included in the model to meet the different demands as well as the data associated with the same present a much higher uncertainty in the 2050 horizon than in the 2030 horizon. The data of the macroeconomic variables they also present much more uncertainty. in addition will see later the series had to be extended European in the framework of the PNIEC reached until the year 2040. For the above reasons in some cases the solution that the model adopts for the year 2050 should be taken as a set of options that represent the optimal solution. Although always considering that this optimum is calculated with the information available today. And that Thus elevated. With reference to what was said in the introduction This exercise has been carried out with the state of the art available but this does not exclude the possibility that in the future new technologies not considered O well that the evolution of costs determines a participation in the energy-productive system different from that contained in this document. This exercise has been carried out with the state of the art available and does not exclude the possibility that in the future new technologies not considered O well of costs determine a different participation in the energetic-productive system. E.4 HYPOTHESIS In this section the main macroeconomic variables that have been considered in the analyzed scenarios are exposed. Note that the variable hypotheses are totally consistent with those used for the PNIEC. These hypotheses were supplied by the European Commission until the year 2040. From that year The following forecasts have been made: ▶ GDP: the MINECO forecast includes GDP data up to the year 2050. ▶ Population: Based on the real population data for the years 2016 and 2017 from the National Institute of Statistics and it is projected until the year 2050 using the report of the European Commission: "The 2018 Aging Report: Economic and Budgetary Projections for the EU Member States (2016-2070)”98  (en adelante: Ageing Report). ▶ Fuel prices: the hypotheses sent by the European Commission have been used up to the year 2040. To complete the period until 2050 the hypotheses of evolution of prices defined by the JRC for use as input data in the POTEnCIA model (March 2018). ▶ OC prices: the hypotheses sent by the European Commission have been used that go up to the year 2040. From 2 of that year, the growth hypothesis contained in the EU Reference Scenario 201699 published by the European Comission. 98 This report is accessible at the following link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/economy-finance/ip065_en.pdf 99 https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/20160713%20draft_publication_REF2016_v13.pdf 129ANNEX E. PROPOSED SCENARIO FOR CLIMATE NEUTRALITY E.4.1 Gross Domestic Product and population The projection of the Gross Domestic Product has been provided by MINECO. Last updated with the latest review of the Stability Program for the year 2018. The projection of GDP beyond the horizon contained in the stability program corresponds to the scenario macroeconomic constructed from the input-output tables of the Spanish economy. said scenario average GDP growth in the period 2021-2050 of 1 32% contemplated in the Aging Report. The population projection is the one included in the aforementioned Aging Report but using as starting data the content in the INE in order to ensure consistency between GDP and population projections. The population Spain experiences a growth of 5.8% in the period between 2020 and 2050. In the following graph the evolution of both variables can be observed: FIGURE E.2 GDP and population projections 1.900 49.500.000 1.800 49.000.000 s the 1,700 48,500,000 from And and 1,600 48,000,000 d s e s n 1.500 47.500.000 a O n e mill 1,400 47,000,000 Lost d is 1,300 46,500,000 One thousand 1.200 46.000.000 1.100 45.500.000 1.000 45.000.000 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 4 6 8 0 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 4 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 GDP at constant prices (base 2016 in billions of €) Population Source: Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation E.4.2 Number of households Regarding the number of households, the following should be noted: ▶ A home is considered to be an inhabited dwelling. ▶ The approximation is made that energy consumption in the residential sector is carried out only in the inhabited dwellings (what has been called households). Namely the effects of unoccupied dwellings.

PROPOSED SCENARIO FOR CLIMATE NEUTRALITY E.4.3 International prices of fossil fuels and costs of emission rights The Spanish energy system is part of global energy trends and markets so the values of the starting variables considered have been those recommended by the European Commission in the framework of carrying out of the National Energy and Climate Plans. Nevertheless these data only go up to the year 2040. Therefore, it has been necessary to estimate the evolution once the ends this series. To perform this the evolution of the prices of these fuels has been used for the decade 2040-2050 that the Joint Research Center considered in March 2018 for inclusion in its POTEnCIA100 model in the period 1980-2050101. On the other hand, in the case of the evolution of fuel prices it has been necessary to complete the series until the year 2050 in this case The values included in the EU Reference Scenario 2016 have been used.

PROPOSED SCENARIO FOR CLIMATE NEUTRALITY E.4.4 Evolution of technology costs The analytical model used for the projection of the energy system TIMES-Synergy the costs of the different energy technologies are a fundamental input data to carry out a projection of the different output variables of the model. To ensure consistency of relative prices between different technologies the data has been taken preferably provided by the JRC of the European Commission in the POTEnCIA model. For all those data not available I know has used commonly accepted international sources where appropriate, adapting the values to the usual typology in the Spanish energy system. It is necessary to point out that to a greater extent than in the 2021-2030 PNIEC exercise on a stage with projections to 2050 the uncertainties are much greater. Not only in terms of the costs of the technologies the fuels any other data to be used; but also from the perspective of when a technology will be considered technically viable and economically. Therefore the exercise carried out in the PRS (covering until the year 2050) inherently includes a Much greater uncertainty than that included in the PNIEC exercise with a time horizon until 2030. E.4.5 Technological development for decarbonization In the analytical exercise carried out to determine the scenarios conducive to the decarbonization of the energy system I know they have included some technologies necessary to undertake the goal of climate neutrality. These technologies are used in those sectors in which there is currently no technological path to carry out a totally productive route decarbonized. In these cases The literature has been consulted to evaluate the sectoral technological possibilities that have specifically described in Chapter 4 of this document. Although some of the technological solutions are currently used in certain sectors In most cases its implementation is not developed on a large scale rather it is limited to specific developments. In some cases technological solutions are currently in the research phase or in the first implementations. The technological processes not included in the scenario without disruptive technologies are the capture storage and use of CO2 and transportation the manufacture of synthetic fuels and advanced biofuels from biomass and the use of decarbonized routes for steel production. In the Climate Neutrality Scenario, the following technologies or solutions have been implemented that respond to the description made. The information included must be interpreted as a guide to focus the research efforts and development towards the problems that these technologies solve namely the economy. ▶ Decarbonised steel production. Methods of saving emissions are used in the steel sector through a change in the manufacturing process. The production routes that appear in the literature both reduce emissions of combustion as those of processes of these technologies. ▶ Other emitting industrial sectors. The capture carbon storage and use also play a role important in the development of the proposed decarbonization solution. The best example of a sector in which it is needed the use of these technologies is that of cement and to a lesser extent in those cases in which there were no other more efficient solutions from a techno-economic point of view. 133ANNEX E. PROPOSED SCENARIO FOR CLIMATE NEUTRALITY ▶ Electric mobility. For the fulfillment of the decarbonization objective proposed for the year 2050 is necessary the development of a wide production of renewable hydrogen namely renewable biogas reforming or biochemical conversion of biomass. This renewable hydrogen has its application both in industrial processes and in transport. ▶ Production storage and use of renewable hydrogen. The importance of fuel switching in the transport sector is high. Therefore the success of decarbonising this sector depends on the correct implementation of the policies aimed at promoting the electric vehicle together with others Alternative fuels. In this case it is not a technology that is under development with electricity. But it would require a major expansion over the next two decades. in order to be implemented in case of heavy transport. Next the effect on mitigation of disruptive technologies is graphically presented commercial scale development in the ELP Scenario disruptivas and achieving climate neutrality with the absence of these technologies in the year 2050 is around 45 million equivalent tons of CO. 2 The technological processes not included in the scenario without disruptive technologies are the capture storage and use of CO 2 the use of hydrogen in the industrial and transport sectors the manufacture of synthetic fuels and biofuels from biomass and the use of decarbonised routes for steel production.

PROPOSED SCENARIO FOR CLIMATE NEUTRALITY E.5 CLIMATE NEUTRALITY SCENARIO E.5.1 Projections of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions As previously mentioned in this document the central objective of the ELP is to achieve climate neutrality for the year 2050. In this direction, it is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050 by least 90% compared to 1990. The rest of the emissions will be offset by the action of natural sinks of carbon. The National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030 proposes a reduction in GHG emissions in the year 2030 23% compared to 1990. The PNIEC is therefore the first step and because of the proximity in time emission reduction path that culminates in the year 2050. In this section the results of the modeling in terms of greenhouse gas emissions are presented greenhouse and its projection until the year 2050. First, the graphic evolution of the same is shown for the set of Spain from 1990 to 2050.

PROPOSED SCENARIO FOR CLIMATE NEUTRALITY As can be seen in the figures above primary energy consumption has a decreasing trend. This is because to the deployment of renewables energy efficiency policies included in the ELP Scenario and discussed in this document. The consumption of petroleum products and natural gas has a residual presence in the Climate Neutrality Scenario since they have been replaced above all by renewable energy and energy efficiency. The circular economy and changes of behavior also contribute in that direction. In the following sections, the impact of these energy intensity policies.

Nevertheless the difference is smaller in final electricity demand than in gross generation. This is because in the ELP Scenario the estimated consumption for the energy transformation sector is considerably higher to that of the Baseline Scenario. The main cause is that the generation of synthetic fuels and hydrogen is associated with a high electrical consumption. 143AANNEEXXOO EE ..

E.5.5 Renewable energies In order to achieve the goal of climate neutrality, it is necessary that in the energy system the contribution of renewable energies renewables is very high. Within the EU the contribution of renewable energies on the final consumption of energy is one of the objectives that measure the progress of the energy transition. To measure this contribution used the methodology established in the Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources 2018/2001. In Figure E.21 The evolution of this percentage is shown according to the precepts established in the aforementioned Directive. In the Climate Neutrality Scenario, the renewable share is increased to 97%. This increase is a result derived from to achieve climate neutrality since the sectorial decarbonization options suppose the almost total reduction of fossil fuels that will be replaced by renewable sources.

Regarding the evolution of primary energy consumption The main conclusions are the reduction of the consumption of energy by energy efficiency measures and behavior change electrification measures and implementation of renewable energies. Figure E. 25 shows the evolution of primary energy consumption for the two scenarios studied. It can be seen as in both cases Efficiency levels of the economy are reached around 60% higher than those that exist today in day.

The Climate Neutrality Scenario reaches an electrification value that exceeds 50% of final energy consumption higher than the Baseline Scenario. The sectors that contribute most to this electrification are services and residential. For your part the services sector is the one that is most electrified in both scenarios since it has a greater facility to electrify its energy consumption through the use of heat pumps to air conditioning for example. In the case of the residential sector of heat pumps facilitate its electrification. further significant electrification due to the electrification of the private vehicle fleet as well as the greater use of the train.

That final percentage of remaining energy dependence is due to the most difficult to decarbonize among which are the aviation sector as the main exponent. This improvement in indigenous energy supply is not only positive from the point of view of security and resilience against unfavorable international circumstances but it is also positive in relation to the country's trade balance and the savings that it can provide throughout the analyzed period (see chapter 8).

The result is that the system is reliable and safe as it is proposed. To this end, seasonal storage needs have been detected in around 30% of the storage that is expected to be available in 2050. It must be taken into account that the analyzed scenario has been carried out with restrictive hypotheses which put this result on the safety side by a very high margin. The following are those that are considered to have the greatest influence: The absence of interconnections with third states given the lack of knowledge about how these will evolve. infrastructures in such a long term. The existence of these advanced interconnections would reduce or make unnecessary the installation of the additional storage power that is discussed in the previous paragraphs. It is assumed that 5% of the demand will be manageable. In such a wide horizon it is considered that it is a hypothesis conservative. In conclusion the Climate Neutrality Scenario proposed for the year 2050 is fully viable from the point of technical and security of supply point of view with seasonal storage. 148ANNEX F ANNEX C.

How do you view this effort in a global context? Most of the contributions value positively the objective of turning the Spanish economy into a neutral economy in emissions in 2050 (some contributions ask that this objective be brought forward to 2040) and the leadership role that Spain is adopting in the fight against climate change highlighting the opportunity what it means for our economy. The contributions highlight the need to act urgently with mechanisms and tools that guarantee an efficient and technologically neutral transition. It is also emphasized that this transformation It must be aligned with the efforts at European and global level to guarantee the competitiveness of National companies. 2) What measures and tools do you think should be included in the Strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? greenhouse? Most of the agents agree that they have to be oriented towards the electrification of the economy saving and energy efficiency and the deployment of renewables in all sectors. For it insist environmental costs correctly so that taxation incorporates the appropriate signals in relation to with CO2 emissions and other polluting emissions. What's more The convenience of carrying out a cost-benefit analysis of the measures and policies is highlighted, and Quantitative objectives are established and the achievements in the different sectors are monitored. Emphasis is also placed on developing measures that mitigate the economic impact on the most vulnerable or affected by the energy transition as well as analyze the economic and social effects related to the impact on energy prices. What's more as cross-cutting measures to decarbonise the economy ▶ Set a price for CO emissions and other air pollutants in all sectors 2 establishing a minimum price for the ton of CO. 2 ▶ Guarantee a stable remuneration framework and financing mechanisms that contribute to decarbonisation What for example ▶ Homogenize environmental taxes among all the Autonomous Communities. ▶ Encourage new technologies and investments that favor the decarbonization of the economy and eliminate fossil fuel incentives. ▶ Reduce corporate tax pressure in Spain. ▶ Take into account the complete life cycle of the different technologies. ▶ Promote coordination between regional and local administrations. ▶ Encourage the circular economy (the bioeconomy is mentioned on several occasions). 152ANNEX F.

PARTICIPATORY PROCESS 3) What measures and tools will be necessary to promote natural carbon sinks? Forests and forest environments play a fundamental role in the decarbonisation of the economy Spanish. Among the contributions received, the message that although the transition must go through a central effort in reducing emissions and decarbonizing the economy the woods have a special potential as carbon sinks that also provide other positive externalities in the form of of ecosystem services generation of activity and employment and protection of biodiversity. For it contributions, the following measures are proposed: ▶ Study the adaptation of forests to climate change. ▶ Require sustainable forest management certificates. ▶ Correctly accounting for the contribution of the sector. ▶ Increase repopulation and wood production. ▶ Capitalize on forests. ▶ Develop biomass as primary energy for rural environments. ▶ Increase resin and cork production. ▶ Encourage activities and services that promote sinkholes and penalize those that destroy or weaken them. ▶ Protection of aquatic sinks.

Promotion in the National Registry of the inscription of sinks of carbon. ▶ Involve the private sector in promoting natural carbon sinks. ▶ Apply restrictions on forest biomass that can be used to generate energy. ▶ Increase resin and cork production. ▶ Restore degraded areas and not allow the planting of forest monocultures. ▶ Design specific transversal policies aimed at the conservation and recovery of certain sinks natural. 4) The challenge entails advancing towards decarbonized models in our main productive sectors and models rationalization of energy consumption which at the same time supposes an opportunity to promote the modernization of our economy the equitable distribution of wealth and the generation of employment in the new green niches. In which sectors of the economy do you think the main challenges will be found? What would be your indications and suggestions to solve them successfully? and the opportunities? excuse me could they be maximized? The challenge of the energy transition lies in developing a gradual and sustainable transformation in its four slopes: technique economical A change in the habits of society is necessary discouraging waste and excessive consumption life models towards healthier styles. The main challenges, as pointed out by the different agents, are found in: ▶ The energy sector covering energy needs efficiently security of supply. ▶ The transport sector decarbonizing the transport of people and goods under the principles of technological neutrality and without affecting industrial competitiveness. ▶ The residential sector eliminating fossil fuels. ▶ The industrial sector: Decarbonize processes highly dependent on fossil fuels. Avoid strategies that generate "lock in" and sunk assets. Avoid relocation. Guarantee affordable energy prices for industry. Developing the CCS. ▶ Electricity generation building a pathway for the penetration of renewables while respecting competitiveness. ▶ The construction and building sector in housing rehabilitation and energy efficiency. ▶ The agricultural sector due to the lack of food in the face of a growing demand. 156ANNEX F. PARTICIPATORY PROCESS ▶ In the water cycle due to scarcity increased by climate change and high energy consumption what does it mean ▶ In tourism for its contribution to GDP. And the opportunities: ▶ In the energy sector for the creation of quality employment and its contribution to GDP. ▶ In the transport sector promoting alternative urban transport modes and accelerating substitution of internal combustion vehicles (some companies propose the use of biofuels and/or biogas in both light and heavy transport). ▶ In the residential promoting the use of the heat pump and energy saving and efficiency through fiscal benefits. ▶ In the industrial using biomass in the production of highly energy-intensive products. creation of a strong and competitive commercial fabric at an international level. ▶ In electricity generation facilitating storage development and demand management by eliminating regulatory barriers. ▶ In construction promoting the construction and rehabilitation of houses with null consumption or practically nil. ▶ In the agricultural sector improving the efficiency of processes in agriculture and using renewable energies and digitization as levers in decarbonization. ▶ In electricity generation facilitating storage development and demand management by eliminating regulatory barriers. ▶ In the water cycle through the creation of zero discharge treatment plants and energy sufficiency. ▶ In tourism orienting the tourist offer towards sustainability 5) What do you consider especially relevant when involving in this process of modernization innovation and decarbonization of all public administrations in our country? The contributions highlight the importance lies in the definition of common objectives for all administrations that they include. Specific sectoral emission reduction plans must be included attention to rural environments where it is necessary to develop a digital transformation to create conditions attractive life and work On the other hand public-private collaborations are considered to be increasingly important to support companies that have the potential to develop solutions for a low-carbon economy and society carbon eliminating uncertainty in decision-making processes citizens. Several comments propose the creation of a Governance mechanism that supervises the execution of the measures and the fulfillment of the objectives and periodically review the objectives of the Strategy being able to count with the support of independent experts. 157ANNEX F. PARTICIPATORY PROCESS 6) What are your suggestions for integrating measures to improve air quality in this Strategy? our cities that lead to health benefits for people? In the long term, it can contribute to the transformation of urban environments to make them friendlier to people. people? According to the available inventories on air pollution improve air quality in cities it means decarbonizing the energy consumption of buildings and transport mainly. Some comments point out that the EU Pollutant Emissions Directives reflect less stringent values than those recommended by the World Health Organization. For this reason, they propose to use the WHO guide values and measure exposure to air pollutants in all cities making information available public. Among the measures to improve air quality and make urban environments friendlier, they propose: in the buildings progressively replace fossil fuel boilers with other emission-free sources (including aerothermal geothermal or the “heat pump”). In those of new construction act on the criteria technicians so that environmental concepts are included in the design and transform buildings into null or almost energetically null (includes references to countries such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands what are you considering ban gas connections to new homes in 2025). In road transport, measures that promote decarbonisation with plans to renew vehicles with subsidies for zero emission vehicles. What's more urban environments can become friendlier for citizens by promoting collective transport (and that it be free of emissions) and modes of active mobility (such as cycling or walking). It is also necessary to reduce travel needs promoting teleworking the teleshopping helping to decarbonize road transport and improve air quality in urban environments is to facilitate the development of rental vehicles (and that the vehicles offered are emission-free). In land use planning and urban planning proposals have been received that include the restriction of vehicles to urban centers the pedestrianization of the streets (with a correct choice of vegetation that can be part of the urban environment to avoid species that release volatile organic compounds) and sustainable urban construction (drainage systems parks floodable use of reclaimed water 7) What would be your suggestions for a social majority to become proactively involved in a commitment with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions? A key aspect in this transformation process is the information training and awareness of issues related to climate change and its implications (e.g. campaigns to encourage citizens to reduce their consumptions). In this frame the contributions indicate that the design of climate policies should incorporate instruments that allow to avoid the rejection of citizenship along with measures to protect consumers more vulnerable. The exemplary nature of public policies can serve to a great extent to raise awareness among citizens what's more public procurement to promote projects with a low carbon footprint can serve as an example to other entities and organizations. Also highlighted in the contributions is the importance of establishing quantitative objectives in all the ministries and that there is coherence between the different measures and policies. Some agents request the creation of a multilevel dialogue platform on energy and climate where the impacts of the climate change and promoting the change of patterns and healthy lifestyles for people and the environment environment. 158ANNEX F. PARTICIPATORY PROCESS 8) What role should they play in this modernization process? innovation and decarbonization of the economy companies and their employer organizations? What suggestions would you make to encourage their proactive involvement and its vocation for economic leadership in this change towards a climate-neutral Spain? Companies are key in this process of energy transition. So that investments can be made necessary contributions agree that it is necessary to establish a long-term stable regulatory framework term that creates legal certainty and certainty for investors and business agents. The Spanish economy is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities of a scenario that I bet you decarbonization for its natural resources need to establish public-private partnerships to achieve the objectives. What's more the different agents propose: ▶ Give clear signals to companies indicate the speed at which you want to advance towards the goal of not emitting CO steam 2050. 2 ▶ Involve companies and organizations in the transformation process. ▶ Create incentives for the cutting-edge processing industry. ▶ Create a CO market across all sectors. 2 ▶ Create regulatory frameworks that create legal security and certainty for investors and business agents. ▶ Promote tax measures that encourage the circular economy and discourage activities that are harmful to the environment. ▶ Promote policies that prevent carbon leakage. ▶ Define sustainable development goals and the 2030 agenda. ▶ Involve employers in the process of drawing up the plans. ▶ Establish corporate social responsibility statutes for companies that promote the use of renewable EE and sustainable mobility. ▶ Promote low carbon policies calculate the carbon footprint of companies. ▶ Modify Royal Decree 163/2014 of May 14 so that the compensation of CO emissions is 2 required. 9) What are the essential adaptation elements that should be included in the Strategy? What sectors do you consider most critical and what policies and measures should be planned? Adaptation to climate change is an increasingly visible issue that is reflected both in national policies as in the growing interest of different international agents. In the contributions received, it is highlighted that the Strategy should include the development of risk plans in the different sectors of the economy in addition to establishing sectoral indicators for monitoring. A) Yes same in facilities and infrastructures, it is considered necessary to reassess the guidelines and technical standards for establish designs resilient to climate change. What's more the contributions indicate that it is necessary: ▶ In the industrial sector facilitate the adaptation of companies to the extreme phenomena caused by the climate change. ▶ In the energy sector establish a capacity mechanism that guarantees security of supply. 159ANNEX F. PARTICIPATORY PROCESS ▶ In the field of carbon sinks study forest adaptation. ▶ In the agriculture sector promote the bioeconomy and avoid food waste. ▶ In the water sector carry out a basin plan that ensures the supply and quality of water. And in general: ▶ Improve the quality and access to information. ▶ Establish a climate risk management framework. ▶ Establish platforms and working groups on adaptation. ▶ Strengthen the relationship between health and climate change. ▶ Recognize the benefits of comprehensive climate action. ▶ Approve plans and strategies for adaptation to emergencies and natural disasters pests and other diseases. 10) In the event of not being able to count on a Law that allows facing the challenge of decarbonization, what other type of of solutions regulatory or non-regulatory international and European commitments on climate change and energy transition? In this section Most of the comments have a unanimous vision: a Law is necessary that guarantees a stable framework in which the investments that manage to decarbonize the economy can be carried out. What's more the Most agents share the view that Both the Strategy and the Climate Change Law should be approved by means of a State Pact. As well A governance mechanism is proposed to supervise the execution of the measures and the fulfillment of the objectives. AND what's more: ▶ Reform of the Electricity Sector Law. ▶ Electricity rate reform. ▶ Reform of the auction system. ▶ Administrative simplification. ▶ Rapid transposition of European Directives. ▶ Creation of a National Forest Fund. ▶ Creation of a National Commission of Experts on Climate Change. ▶ Speed up coal abandonment. ▶ Sectoral and regional plans (particularly for rail freight transport). ▶ Aviation taxes. ▶ Eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. ▶ Moratorium on construction projects for new highways or airports. ▶ Action plans in cities (pedestrianization of urban centers promotion of public transport and of other shared means of transport). 160F.2 PUBLIC CONSULTATION OF THE DRAFT In the public consultation process of the draft of the Long-Term Strategy carried out between July 23 and 30 September 78 entities have participated (25). Additionally, 10 environmental associations and NGOs have participated. 6 confederations professional colleges 3 individuals and 2 foundations FIGURE F.2 Typology of complainants AAPP Environmental Association Business Association Professional associations Business Confederation Private NGO Foundation Regarding the specific field or sector of the complainants The following graph shows the distribution. Most of the entities are linked to the energy and environment sectors The transport sector is also noteworthy. manufacturing and building. The term “Others” groups entities such as NGOs business and trade union confederations or professional associations: FIGURE F.3 Scope of the complainants Digitization Environment Manufacturing Waste management Energy Transport Building Others 161Conclusiones The allegations received show a high level of diversity which as a whole indicate that the proposed strategy is generally balanced in terms of the different technological or sectoral areas relevant disaggregation for a strategic planning exercise to 2050 such as the one proposed. A significant part of the proposals received have been incorporated. Roughly referred to ideas and proposals already collected in different sections of the Strategy that required reinforcement or extension to other parts of the document. These include: ▶ In reference to renewable hydrogen in coherence with the Hydrogen Roadmap recently approved by government its inclusion has been requested in some sections ▶ Regarding the taxonomy the reference to Regulation (EU) 2020/852 has been extended Sustainable. ▶ The evolution of the pandemic in the months since the publication of the first draft of this strategy has advised include appropriate references to COVID-19. ▶ Several references to the Recovery Plan have been incorporated Transformation and Resilience of the Economy announced after the publication of the initial draft of this strategy and whose objectives and priorities are aligned with climate neutrality. ▶ The role of environmental taxation has been clarified. ▶ Regarding air quality it has been possible to improve the technical drafting of the text. ▶ Organic farming and extensive livestock: claims are included that refer to the important long-term role term of these among other of climate change. ▶ Same references have been included to the new Strategies (Biodiversity and From Farm to Fork) published in 2020 by the European Commission as central elements of the Green Pact and its importance for environmental ambition and climate of the Post-2020 CAP Strategic Plans. ▶ Adaptation to climate change: the conclusions resulting from the analysis of the contributions in terms of adaptation have led to the inclusion of three of them among which one stands out that has led to the revision of chapter 5 (Adaptation to climate change) and very specially align them with the new National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change 2021-2030 approved last 22 September 2020. In addition Based on the comments received, specific modifications have been made in the sections B.2.4.8 (marine environment) and B.2.4.10 (energy system). ▶ The importance of energy saving and efficiency has been further reinforced As a first step in all areas for decarbonization. ▶ Insist on the idea of the necessary transfer to the market of all the innovations and advances that occur in universities technology centers and such institutions. ▶ Given the long lifespan of the buildings and the relatively low renovation rate compared to other sectors it is necessary to align measures long-term decarbonization goals. ▶ Insist on the importance of the digital transition for the energy transition and decarbonisation. 162The allegations referring to errors in the text clarification of data and graphs or other aspects of improvement have been accepted and included. On the other hand Some of the allegations and contributions received have been rejected. These can be framed in following types: ▶ Those that requested a level of detail on measurements and quantitative data incompatible with the horizon and the nature of the Strategy and its consequent technological and conjunctural lack of definition. As stated in your introduction the The mission of the ELP is not to know how the specific technological changes will take place in the different sectors of the economy but to present a coherent proposal on said transformation using scientific knowledge- technician available today. ▶ Similarly other allegations demanded express reference to the disaggregation of renewable fuels in Strategy. Due to the high uncertainty associated with the time horizon of the Strategy this includes the renewable fuels in general without specifying if they are of biological origin or not. ▶ Allegations about contents that exceed this document requesting a degree of detail and specificities of measures that do not correspond to a strategic document. These questions will be developed in other documents. like the PNIEC the Energy Storage Strategy develop into more specific mechanisms such as the CAP and its different application periods. ▶ Those relating to specific technologies whose inclusion would violate the principle of technological neutrality. ▶ Regarding the level of electrification of the energy system It is highlighted that the goal of national electrification of the 52.3% by 2050 is similar to the 53% of the most ambitious scenario of the Commission (ELEC scenario) and much higher than the 41% projected in the least ambitious (P2X scenario). ▶ Regarding the allegations regarding waste management and the circular economy it was about applications for incorporation of concepts and technologies already included in various chapters of the strategy albeit with a different structure and wording or existing obligations arising from European regulations and always assuming the waste hierarchy. further The Circular Economy Strategy will address this specific area of action in more detail. ▶ In the case of fluorinated gases Some allegations were contrary to the regulations on fluorinated gases currently in force. force or involved development or governance measures. ▶ In the field of sinks it has been considered necessary to comply with the accounting standards agreed upon at the International applicable to the EU and Spain as well as disaggregation incompatible with the temporary and strategic framework of this document. ▶ Those that request the inclusion in certain headings of proposals or details that are already sufficiently treated in others yes with that 163ANNEX G ANNEX C.
