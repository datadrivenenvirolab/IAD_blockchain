Preamble  
At COP26 in Glasgow, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari announced that Nigeria will cut 
its carbon emissions and reach net-zero by 2060. The President subsequently signed into law a 
new climate bill that create five-year emission budgets, with a view  to achieving net-zero 
greenhouse gas emissions between 2050 and 2070.  
This Long-Term Vision, intended as a first contribution towards the invitation in Article 4.19 of 
the Paris Agreement to communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emissions development 
strategies (LT-LEDS), was elaborated in 2020-2021, to collect a broad set of views and prepare 
for the construction of a full long-term strategy to explore how Nigeria can achieve its new climate 
ambition. 
Executive Summary  
Nigeria, as one of the signatories to the Paris Agreement (PA), recognises that the transition to 
low-emission development is indispensable for achieving sustainable economic growth through 
pathways that yield reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other social, economic, and 
environmental benefits.  
In addition to the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that outline climate actions until 
2030, the Paris Agreement, under Article 4.19, calls for all Parties to strive to formulate and 
communicate LT-LEDS, considering common but differentiated responsibilities and respective 
capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.   
To this end, the Federal Government of Nigeria decided to develop its LT-LEDS as part of her 
onus to ensure a low-carbon future, with an initial focus on a Long-Term Vision to 2050 for the 
country. The vision provides a clear sense of direction to all stakeholders for a well-managed 
transition to a low-carbon economy that grows existing and new sectors, creating new jobs and 
economic opportunities for the nation. 
The vision states that: By 2050, Nigeria is a country of low-carbon, climate-resilient, high-
growth circular economy that reduces its current level of emissions by 50%, moving towards 
having net-zero emissions across all sectors of its development in a gender-responsive manner. 
 
It is hoped that this vision will promote sustainable development and guarantee a climate-proofed 
economic  development  through  multi-stakeholder  engagement,  especially  as  Nigeria  is  also 
engaged in developing  Medium-Term (2021-2025) and Long-Term (Agenda 2050) national 
development plans. It is also expected to lay a solid foundation for Nigeria to contribute to the 
global objective of climate neutrality, and to be a climate-resilient society with a knowledge-driven 
economy that is globally competitive and compliant with Africa’s Agenda 2063, as well as enable 
the country to play its leadership role in Africa effectively.  
The Federal Government of Nigeria will now build on this initial long-term vision to develop a 
full long-term strategy.

1.  Introduction 
 
1.1  Background 
Nigeria faces many challenges in her effort to advance its socio-economic and environmental 
development. A particular challenge is climate change that continues to portend serious threat to 
the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the country. This is because Nigeria 
is strongly predisposed to severe negative impacts of climate change due to its fragile economy, 
weak resilience, and low adaptive capacity, as much of the economy is dependent on climate-
sensitive ecosystems and natural resources. For example, the agriculture sector, which contributes 
about 24% to the country’s GDP and largely rain-fed, is highly vulnerable to climate change-
induced frequent and severe extreme events, such as floods and droughts. Other sectors of the 
economy are also vulnerable.  
The 2017 Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) published by the UK-based risk company, 
Verisk Maplesoft, classifies Nigeria as a region of high risk, and indicated that the country is one 
of the topmost vulnerable countries in the world. If no adaptation is implemented, DFID (2009)1 
estimated that between 2-11% of Nigeria’s GDP could potentially be lost by 2020, thereby 
hampering the national development goal of becoming one of the top 20 economies in the world. 
Worse still, the same study indicated that climate change could result in a loss in GDP of between 
6% and 30% by 2050, worth an estimated US$ 100 to 460 billion dollars. Kompas et al (2018) 
further indicated that, with a 3o C rise in global temperature, Nigeria will, in the long-term (beyond 
2067), experience up to 16% reduction in its GDP2. Climate projections for the coming decades 
also reveal a significant increase in temperature over cities across all the ecological zones3. 
Overcoming the development challenge of climate change requires that extensive adaptation and 
mitigation measures that are necessary to reduce vulnerability to future climate change are put in 
place (FGoN, 2017)). Addressing the challenge climate change poses to national development in 
a sustainable manner requires that Nigeria moves its economy into a more environment-friendly, 
climate resilient, green, and sustainable path. 
As a result of its relatively low economic development, Nigeria’s GHG emissions remain relatively 
low. The total GHG emission in 2018 from various sectors (agriculture, electricity, forestry, 
industry, oil and gas, transport, waste etc) was 336 million tons of CO2-equivalent (Figure 1)4. 
With this level of emission, Nigeria compares favourably with South Africa in terms of emitting 
less than 1% of global emissions, However, as its economy is expected to grow rapidly by at least 
7% per annum, particularly in the post COVID-19 period, to meet the demands of its large 
population that is projected to increase to about 402 million by 2050, Nigeria is expected to emit 
more GHGs in the very near future. This calls for a more ambitious future mitigation efforts in 
keeping with the country’s international climate commitments and with massively increasing 
adaptation finance to contribute to the global efforts to achieve a net zero emission by 2050.

Figure 1. Major GHG Emitting Sources in the Economy of Nigeria 
 
Nigeria’s relationship with climate change is further complicated by the fact that the nation’s mono 
economy is almost entirely dependent on oil mining and export which does not only make it hard 
to decouple emissions from economic growth trajectory but also leaves Nigeria in a highly unstable 
and vulnerable fiscal and macroeconomic condition with high fluctuations in global oil price linked 
to global transition to the green economy and other factors driving energy demand.  
However, global trends suggest that ambitious transitions towards low emissions development will 
further skew the energy outlook with devastating impacts on Nigeria’s economy if there are no 
sustainable  low  carbon  implementation  plans  for  alternative  growth.  Thus,  addressing  the 
challenge that climate change poses to national development remains one of the most important 
and fundamental requirements for long term economic planning effectiveness in Nigeria.  Long 
Term Low-Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) or Long-Term Strategies (LTS) have 
emerged as a veritable tool and approach with which countries explore the GHG emissions 
implications of their development aspirations aa options for that can help to decouple economic 
growth from emissions to bridge sustainable development and climate goals.  
The imperative for transition to low-emission development is a global phenomenon and has been 
recognized internationally (especially by United Nations) as a veritable way to stabilizing GHG 
concentrations with the attendant consequence of significantly mitigating the impact of climate 
change.  The Copenhagen Accord (2009) –Paragraph 2, states that: “A low emission development 
strategy is indispensable for sustainable development”. In a similar vein, the Paris Agreement 
(2015)  –Article  4,  Paragraph  19  states  that:  “All  Parties  should  strive  to  formulate  and 
2 
  
 
communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies, mindful of Article 2 
taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in 
the light of different national circumstances.” 
The Paris Agreement of 2015, to which Nigeria is a Party, was a key turning point in the global 
drive towards transition to low-emission development. It recognized the long-term vision of a 
transition to low-emission development strategies (LT-LEDS) as indispensable for achieving 
sustainable economic growth through pathways that yield reduced GHG emissions and other 
social, economic, and environmental benefits. The Paris Agreement, and subsequently the IPCC 
Special Report of 20185 are clear that LTS will play important roles towards the collective goal to 
hold the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C and to pursue efforts to limit 
the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, which will require global efforts to 
peak GHG emissions as soon as possible and followed by multiple action for rapid reduction to 
achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions and removals by sinks in the second half of 
the century. 
An LTS is an urgent requirement for Nigeria as it offers the country with binary benefits of tool 
and process for renaissance in its vision of national development approach and articulate a 
longitudinal vision for a climate-resilience and climate consciousness that are compatible with 
tangible development. It goes without saying that to stand a chance of meeting her medium to long 
term climate objectives including the attainment of zero-emissions target of world record by 2050, 
a clear and efficient set of measures, will need to be adopted and implemented. To this end, 
Nigeria, with the support from the 2050 Pathways Platform and anchored at the Department of 
Climate Change (DCC) of the Federal Ministry of Environment (Annex1) adopted this visioning 
approach to the development of its LT-LEDS. This is seen as critical to generating a long-term 
pathway that reflects a variety of social and economic development objectives and diverse 
stakeholders’ interests to pave the way for robust policy choices zones6. 
The rationale for Nigeria’s decision to undertake a visioning approach, which is the initial and first 
step in an LT-LEDS development process is based on the recognition of the peculiar local threats 
posed by climate change to the economic development aspirations of the country.  Nigeria is aware 
that its heavy dependence on fossil fuel makes the country especially vulnerable in a world that 
has a target to reduce or even eliminate fossil fuel as a key driver of the global economy.  Several 
her trading partners, such as China, European Union, India, Japan, and the United States have 
decided to go ‘net zero’ and a number of these countries are already setting bans on the sale of oil-
consuming Internal Combustion Engine vehicles. The risk for future oil markets is averred and not 
theoretical. At the same time, Nigeria is also aware that not responding to a long-term view and 
acting urgently to increase its resilience to climate impact will compromise its ambition to 
economic prosperity.  
Moreover, as a Party to the Paris Agreement, Nigeria’s LT-LEDS is also in response to the Paris 
Agreement’s Article 4.19, which calls on Parties to elaborate LT-LEDS. Responding to the 
challenge of climate change through the pursuit of a low carbon development path therefore 
remains the most viable and feasible option for the sustainable development of Nigeria. The long-

term vision provides Nigeria the pathway to discuss the opportunities that might arise in terms of 
a cleaner, more dynamic, and more sustainable growth model, and the options for the country to 
implement a less carbon-intensive model of economic development in the face of decreasing global 
reliance of fossil fuel energy for development practices. Achieving a climate-neutral economy by 
2050 will require progressively phasing out or profoundly changing the country’s carbon-intensive 
industries. This will be particularly challenging and will require a well-managed transition through 
effective visioning. 
 
1.2  Establishing Nigeria’s Long-Term Vision 
Nigeria signed the Paris Agreement in September 2016 and ratified it in March 2017, and thus 
committed to reducing its GHG emissions. In its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), the 
country pledged an unconditional 20% reduction on Business as Usual (BAU) emissions by 2030, 
and a 45% conditional commitment which could be achieved with financial assistance, technology 
transfer and capacity building. This shows a strong national commitment to be part of the 
international effort to achieve the long-term temperature goal set by the Paris Agreement of 
“holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial 
levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 
With the implementation of all the Low Carbon Development (LCD) opportunities, it is expected 
that in 2035, GHG emissions for the Business as Usual (BaU) scenario will decrease from the BaU 
level of 967.2 Gg CO2-eq (under the different IPCC Sectors are expected to grow from about 
609,836.74 Gg CO2-eq in 2016) to an LCD level of 797.2 Gg CO2-eq7. 
 
The Paris Agreement, to which Nigeria is committed, also recommends that all Parties should 
strive  to  formulate  and  communicate  LT-LEDS  by  2020  as  long-term  vision/strategy  for 
responding  to  climate  change.  Leveraging  its  NDC,  Nigeria  is  integrating  into  its  national 
development agenda, a transition to a low-carbon development pathway because of the tremendous 
benefits it holds for sustainable national development. In the long run, an LT-LEDS is important 
for Nigeria as it would enable her to:  
i.  carve out a national vision for climate-resilient society that will help in the integration and 
coordination of critical action programmes on economic, environmental, health, and other 
sectors, as well as turning programmes, strategies, and plans into concrete actions.  
ii.  establish a clear trajectory for achieving a low carbon development, the pillars for such a 
vision and the policies and measures that will help in the actualization of the vision.  
iii.  realign its national policy on climate change to meet the overarching goal of the country’s 
LT-LEDS by 2050. 
iv.  build on partnerships that for the Economy and Climate, bringing together government, 
business, and economic leaders to enhance global and national understanding of how 
climate action can and drive economic, social and development objectives; and 
v.  set Nigeria on a low-emission, green growth and climate-resilient development pathway 
that will not only help the country to meet its international climate commitments with 
appropriate actions but also establish implementable policies and financing priorities for 
low  emission  economic  growth  and  support  buy-in  and  ownership  across  numerous 
stakeholders around a shared vision.

1.3  Process for the development of this Vision 
 
An all-inclusive approach was adopted for the development of the Nigeria’s vision of the LT-
LEDS. The visioning approach which represented the preparatory phase for the development of 
the full Strategy, involved: 
•  Identification and selection of relevant experts that can evolves ideas in tandem with 2050 
Low-carbon Vision, comprising experts from MDAs, academia, industry, and civil society 
organizations on a broad spectrum of options for Nigeria’s long-term vision of reducing 
GHG emissions by 2050 and developing development enhancing adaptation measures. 
•  Policy survey and analysis of other national policies and strategies with medium to long-
term climate targets and aspirations 
•  Stakeholders’ consultation to elucidate responses on what should constitute Nigeria’s 
vision and LT-LEDS to ensure ownership of the LTV for Nigeria.; and 
•  Drafting and production of the Nigeria’s long-term Vision that articulates the national and 
sectoral Vision to 2050 for the country, as well as of a full workplan/ Terms of Reference 
for the elaboration of the full LT-LEDS. 
 
This LT-LEDS, of which the LTV development process supported by the 2050 Pathways Platform 
is a part of, will also build on other ongoing visioning and quantification exercises such as the 
Nigeria Agenda 2050, as well as the Deep Decarbonisation Pathways Project funded by the French 
Development Agency (AFD).  
 
The 2050 Pathways Platform is an initiative that was launched in Marrakech at COP22. The 
objective of the Platform is to support the elaboration of long-term, net zero-greenhouse gas, 
climate resilient and sustainable development pathways (LT-LEDS). The 2050 Pathways Platform 
provides a space for collective problem solving through the development of long-term, deep 
decarbonization  strategies,  including  the  sharing  of  resources  (finance,  capacity  building), 
knowledge and experiences.  
 
The LT-LEDS include key elements which include: (i) strong government commitment and 
leadership;  (ii)  emission  reduction  target(s)  before  and  in  2050/mid-century;  (iii)  emission 
reduction scenarios/pathways (with more ambitious scenarios); )iv) social development objectives; 
(v) economic growth objectives; (vi) objectives for protecting and improving the management and 
use  of  natural  resources  and  ecosystems;  (vii)  consideration  of  climate  change  adaptation, 
institutional, capacity building, governance; and (viii) investment/financing requirements (Figure 
2).

2.  Overview of Nigeria’s Policy-Related Response to Climate Change 
 
2.1  National Context 
 
Nigeria is located approximately between latitudes 3°15’ to 13°30’ N and longitudes 2°59’ to 
15°00’ E, sharing boundaries with the Republic of Benin to the west, Niger to the north, Chad to 
the north-eastern corner and Cameroon to the east, as well as the Atlantic Ocean to the south. It 
has a land mass of about 923,768 km2 and is the 14th largest country in Africa. Nigeria’s 
population has grown phenomenally from about 123 million in 2000 to about 189 million in 2016 
and remains one of the fastest growing population in the world. With an annual growth rate of 
3.2%, the country’s population is projected to be about 402 million by 2050 with a high probability 
of making Nigeria the world’s third largest population - behind India and China. The two main 
features of this growth are the young age structure with more than two-fifths of the population 
(42.8%) falling below 15 years and the persistently high fertility rate of 5-7 children per woman. 
 
Nigeria’s economy is the largest in Africa, although it remains a lower middle-income country, 
with an income per capita of about $2,800 in 2015. It has a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 
more than US$500 billion and witnessed a steady growth annual average of 7.2% between 2005 
and 2014. The relatively stable growth was due to strong and stable macroeconomics, supported 
by the oil sector growth, as well as the inclusion of the previously neglected sectors such as the 
entertainment  industry  and  ICT  in  the  GDP  computation.  The  GDP  growth  rate  declined 
dramatically to 2.8 percent in 2015 and -1.6 percent in 2016, showing underlying weaknesses in 
the macroeconomic fundamentals. Imports to the country are predominantly non-oil goods and 
services, including among others, food and beverages, primary and processed industrial goods and 
capital goods.  
 
Economic diversification and strong growth are yet to translate into a significant decline in poverty 
levels, as over 62% of Nigerians still live-in extreme poverty. Despite its strong fundamentals, oil-
rich Nigeria has been seriously challenged by a wide range of binding constraints, including 
inadequate power supply, lack of infrastructure, delays in the passage of legislative reforms, an 
inefficient  property  registration  system,  restrictive  trade  policies,  an  inconsistent  regulatory 
environment, a slow and ineffective judicial system, unreliable dispute resolution mechanisms, 
insecurity, and perceived pervasive corruption. Persistent finance risks, regulatory constraints and 
security risks have limited new investment in oil and natural gas, and Nigeria's oil production has 
contracted every year since 2012. The World Bank Group Flagship Report: Doing Business 2017 
ranked Nigeria 169th out of 190 countries in the world in the ease of doing business, 44 places 
lower than in 20108.  
 
Agriculture is Nigeria’s single largest economic sector, and one of the most important areas for 
development for the country. In 2016, it accounted for 24.4% of GDP, but only 4.8% of the 
country’s total foreign earnings. It employs up to 70% of the labour force9.

Nigeria is endowed with many renewable and non-renewable energy resources in commercial 
quantities and some of the best natural forms. The prominent renewable energy resources include 
sun, wind, hydro, biomass, and tidal wave while crude oil, coal, lignite, tar sands, natural gas, and 
nuclear elements constitute the major non-renewable energy resources. Despite these huge energy 
endowments, the very lack of access to affordable and reliable energy services is hindering the 
industrial production and economic growth of the country. The poverty of energy in Nigeria is 
such that all manufacturing firms depend on self-generated electricity to power their operations 
and to maintain power back-up in the event of power failure. Visioning for future sustainable 
development in a low carbon development scenario requires that energy poverty (being the lack of 
access to modern energy services) eradication is taken as critical10. Sustainable energy for all is 
essential for the economic growth of Nigeria. 
 
The human health status is a key  factor of the development of the country, but Nigeria’s 
performance in this sector remains poor. The life expectancy at birth in 2016 was 54.5 years, an 
increase of 7.5 years from 2007, but remains below the national target of 70 years by 2015 and the 
global average of 71 years. The Healthy Life Expectancy of Nigerians was 47.4 years in 2016, 
which implies 6.8 years of compromised health. Regionally, Nigeria compares poorly - the life 
expectancy of Ghanaians is 10 years more. According to the 2016 Global Burden of Disease Study, 
while Nigeria is undergoing an epidemiological transition, communicable diseases still constitute 
the bulk of disease burden11.  
 
The country faces a wide range of environmental challenges. Some of the specific phenomena 
include Climate Change, which is negatively affecting every sector of the country’s economy, 
particularly agriculture and water resources. Other challenges are deforestation and de-vegetation, 
causing biodiversity loss and land degradation; floods, drought and desertification which are 
degrading  the  environment  especially  in  the  semi-arid  areas  of  the  country;  environmental 
pollution encompassing air, water, land, and noise; waste generation; mineral excavation and the 
accompanying  environmental degradation as well as limited access to  safe water  and poor 
sanitation. 
 
Nigeria is also confronted with a myriad of socio-economic challenges. One of these is inflation, 
which has remained in double digits for many years. The other prominent challenges are economic 
recession with its associated growing youth unemployment, high cost of living and corruption, 
which is creating a clog in the wheels of the nation’s development. There are also several social 
and religious conflicts, prominent among which are the Boko Haram insurgency, Niger Delta 
militancy, kidnapping, farmers/herders’ clashes, agitation for self-determination and ethnicity 
challenges. All of these have led to colossal loss of lives and properties. They have also generated 
wider divides, especially along religious and ethnic lines. This situation is unlike what is happening 
in many other countries such as Canada and the USA where diversity in ethnicity and languages 
have been exploited to foster strength and unity. 
 
Fighting poverty and insecurity and tackling climate change remain three critical development 
challenges for Nigeria, as they all impact the utilization of its natural resources. Meeting these

challenges needs fresh ideas and a radical new way of thinking and doing things. This includes 
strategic planning and how we maintain, improve, and use our natural resources (renewable and 
non-renewable) to generate and sustain long-term pro-poor economic growth, thereby reducing 
poverty and supporting the achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). It also 
requires that new strategic approaches be put in place to attract significant investment in the 
country’s natural capital (including land, forests, landscapes, water, and fisheries), which is a direct 
source of income and employment for a large share of Nigeria’s people, to make it climate resilient 
as climate change affects the ability of natural capital to deliver its wide range of products and 
services. Sustaining and managing natural capital is crucial to the ability of the country to invest 
in the other types of capital in a sustainable fashion. The situation becomes more critical in many 
parts of Nigeria where the fragile natural capital is also highly vulnerable to the impact of climate 
change.  
 
2.2  Addressing the Climate Change Challenge: Mitigation and Adaptation Measures 
Nigeria recognizes that one of her main development challenges is to tame climate change from 
creating a catastrophe for its people and environment. To this end, and in line with global best 
practices, two sets of measures have often been advocated for confronting climate change. These 
are mitigation measures (such as reductions in emissions of GHG and black soot) to prevent the 
degree of climate change from becoming unmanageable; and adaptation measures (such as 
building irrigation systems and adjusting agricultural practices) to reduce the harm from climate 
change that proves unavoidable. While mitigation seeks to limit climate change by reducing the 
emissions of GHG and by enhancing ‘sink’ opportunities, adaptation aims to alleviate the 
adverse impacts through a wide-range of system-specific actions that also improves quality of 
life.  
 
Nigeria also notes that overcoming the development challenge of climate change requires more 
extensive adaptation and mitigation measures than currently being applied to reduce vulnerability 
to future climate change. Future vulnerability will depend not only on the degree of climate change 
but also on the development “pathway” taken, as well as capacity put in place to cope with the 
climate change stress. Mitigating GHG emissions and enhancing the adaptive capacity to increase 
resilience can accelerate the pace of progress towards sustainable development. Adapting to 
climate change involves reducing exposure and sensitivity and increasing adaptive capacity to 
build a climate-resilient society. Further to these two broad measures (mitigation and adaptation), 
Nigeria will also need to promote economic diversification – going beyond lowering the carbon 
content of activities, but also moving away from oil export dependency. 
 
National mitigation and adaptation measures are guided by the new National Climate Change 
Policy12,  which  vision  is  low-carbon,  climate-resilient  Nigeria,  and  a  mission  of  ensuring 
sustainable development and a climate proofed economy through multi-stakeholder engagement. 
The goal of the policy is to promote a low-carbon, climate-resilient and gender-responsive 
sustainable socio-economic development, which is expected to (i) reduce Nigeria’s vulnerability 
to climate change impacts, (ii) improve its social, economic, and ecological resilience. (iii) reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, (iv) increased awareness of climate change impacts and adaptation and 
mitigation measures, (v) enhance and strengthen research, innovation and technology development

and transfer and systematic observations, (vi) enhance capacity to implement climate change 
related interventions at national, state and community levels, and (vii) mainstream climate change 
and its cross-cutting issues in national development. A major objective of the goal of Nigeria’s 
Climate Change Policy is the implementation of adaptation and mitigation measures with co-
benefits and SDG focused outcomes that promote low-carbon development in the country and 
reduce the vulnerability of Nigerians to the impacts of climate change. 
 
Within the strategic policy response framework of fostering low-carbon, high growth economic 
development path and building a climate resilient society to enable Nigeria to meet the challenge 
of climate change, Nigeria has also identified priority courses of action that will be implemented 
in  its  ten-year  (2021  –  2030)  Climate  Change  Programme 13.  These  activities  take  into 
consideration the focused areas of the national policy on climate change and the opportunities 
offered by international agreements and conventions that Nigeria is party to. Programme focus 
areas  are  targeted  at  (i)  managing  for  resilience  in  ecosystems,  infrastructure  and  human 
communities through mitigation and adaptation strategies and initiatives; (ii) addressing current 
risks, vulnerabilities, policies, capacities, and gaps in knowledge; (iii) facilitating internal and 
external resources for climate financing; and (iv) engaging internal and external partners in seeking 
solutions. 
 
In contributing to global efforts to reduce GHG emissions and attaining a low-carbon economy, 
Nigeria will analyse its options for reducing greenhouse gases, assess various mitigation scenarios 
and explore various mitigation options that may include increasing the availability of carbon sinks 
(biological absorption of GHGs) and reducing the level of emissions released into the atmosphere 
from  sectors identified in the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) (i.e. agriculture, power, 
oil and gas, transport, industry, water and waste sectors) which produce the greatest amounts of 
emissions in the country. The strategies will lay emphasis on (i) reducing GHG emissions, (ii) 
preventing  new  GHG  emissions  to  be  released  in  the  atmosphere  and  (iii)  preserving  and 
enhancing sinks and reservoirs of GHGs (e.g., by protecting natural carbon sinks like forests or 
creating new sinks - carbon sequestration). 
 
Since climate change is now inevitable, putting strategies and measures in place to adapt to these 
changes also remains significant. The country’s approach is to treat adaptation to climate change 
as an issue of climate-resilient development, rather than as a bespoke set of activities (flood 
defenses, drought plans, and so on), combining climate and development challenges into a single 
strategy. The aim is to protect the health of the ecosystems and the people, human settlements and 
infrastructure, as well as energy supply among others from climate-related damages and to 
maximise the benefits from climate-related opportunities. This will prepare Nigeria for a climate-
resilient future. The challenge for the country then is how to rapidly develop the economy and 
fulfill its obligation to the global climate change agreement as elaborated in its NDC.

2.3  Nigeria’s NDC 
Nigeria recently updated and submitted the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the 
United Nations Climate Change Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as part 
of her commitment to the global target of keeping the earth’s warming below 2oC in line with 
Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement. 
In the updated NDC, Nigeria recommits to its unconditional contribution of 20% below business-
as-usual by 2030 and increases its conditional contribution from 45% to 47% below business-as-
usual by 2030, provided that sufficient international support is forthcoming. In addition to the 
existing sectors of the 2015 NDC, Nigeria in scaling up her ambitious targets, included the waste 
and water resources sectors and articulates other nature-based solutions not included in the 2015 
NDC. 
An investment of 177 billion USD is indicated in the NDC for   implementation that covers 2021-
2030.  This value is economy-wide productive investments that is not expected to be a burden 
exclusively on the government budget.

2.4  Achieving Sustainable Development Goals in the Face of Climate Change 
Promoting conservation and sustainable use and management of natural resources to reduce the 
risks associated with climate extremes as well as resilience building are critical elements for the 
attainment of many of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and Agenda 2030.  Extremes 
weather events, such a floods, storm surges, and heat waves can strain cities, roads, drainage 
systems, power plants, ports, and other types of infrastructure. Also, climate change further 
threatens the national ability to build and sustain its human capital, particularly through health and 
education. The concern is that climate change could threaten or reverse Nigeria’s advances towards 
the attainment of the SDGs and overall national development. Thus, all effort should be geared 
towards ensuring the resilience of the ecosystem through mitigation and adaptation measures. 
 
The NDC sectoral plans identifies strategies to promote economic and social development in a 
way that sustainably grows Nigeria’s economy at 5% per year while making the country more 
resilient to climate impacts. If implemented, the NDC will improve standards of living, promote 
clean energy access and food and water security for all, whilst reducing emissions under the 20-
45% below business as usual by 2030. 
 
Implementation of the NDC will serve as a catalyst for a comprehensive national climate action 
and offers Nigeria several opportunities to advance the attainment of sustainable development 
goals in the country. They include: (i) inducing long-term changes in key economic drivers and 
sectors, such as power, oil and gas, industry, transport and agriculture and forests; (ii) improving 
national scope to drive climate change actions at the local level; (iii) keeping up political 
momentum at the national level and strengthening climate change legislation; (iv) embedding  a 
longer-term  vision  for low-emission  climate  resilient  development  for  social  and  economic 
11 
  
 
development as well as poverty eradication; (v) mobilizing finance for climate change from diverse 
sources and creating an enabling environment for private sector investment in climate mitigation 
and adaptation; (vi) providing innovative measures and mechanisms for the integration of climate 
change into development planning and strategies at all levels of governance in the country; (vii) 
presenting a common force  to strengthen national adaptation efforts; (viii) warehousing climate 
policy coordination in a cross-cutting body that is better able to influence policy in major sectors 
of the economy; and (ix) engaging with government departments, companies and stakeholders in 
sectors that need to transition into a low-emission resilient development pathway and help 
mainstreaming climate action into sectoral policies and investments, among others. This approach 
supports national efforts on the attainment of SDGs, and all that Nigeria now needs is a further 
development  of  the  political  framework  and  existing  institutions  to  strategically  plan  and 
implement the necessary climate change and adaptation measures within a well-formulated long-
term vision of development.

3.  Nigeria’s 2050 Vision 
 
3.1   Current Situation 
 
Nigeria is a nation of vision. The Vision 20:2020 was the major national development strategy 
directing the development process in Nigeria in the last decade and during the development of the 
NDC. This Federal Government’s economic growth plan recognises climate change as a threat to 
sustainable growth in the coming decades. It perceives climate change as a potential driver of 
“damaging and irrecoverable effects on infrastructure, food production and water supplies, in 
addition to precipitating natural resource conflict”. This Vision is currently being updated to reflect 
the country’s vision of development for 2030. There is also an ongoing initiative to develop an 
Agenda  2050 14  aimed  at  making  Nigeria  a  socio-economically  advanced  nation  with  a 
technologically enabled, digitally connected, diversified and inclusive sustainable economy. This 
2050 Development Agenda for the country is seen to advocate for the adoption of global best 
practices to development in Nigeria. It is anticipated to obviously include a visionary approach to 
address the challenge of future  climate change scenarios within the national framework of 
contributing to the global agreement of limiting global warming-induced temperature increase of 
1.5OC above pre-industrial level. The 2020 Economic Sustainability Plan envisioned a resilient 
and sustainable development in post-COVID-19 Nigeria, which also includes climate resilience. 
 
In  addition,  many  of  the  national  policies  contain  elements  of  visioning  for  low  carbon 
development.  The vision of its current Policy on Climate Change is a low-carbon, climate-resilient 
Nigeria, while that of its NDC is climate-smart development with emphasis on (i) climate-smart 
approach to ensure GHG efficiency and minimize GHG emissions in its agriculture sector; (ii) 
promoting  climate-resilient  industrial  development  and  adoption  of  green  technology  in  its 
industrial sector; (iii) transitioning from fossil fuels and reducing gas flaring and fugitive methane 
emissions through incentivizing the productive use of the gas in its oil and gas sector; (iv) 
sustainable energy for all (SE4All) by 2030 in its power sector; and (v) fast, safe, efficient, 
affordable, integrated and inter-modal transport system for goods and people to drastically reduce 
GHG emissions in the transport sector. Also, improved energy access for all towards a low-carbon 
economic development is the focus of the country’s Energy Policy, with a focus on clean 
renewable energy development in its Rural Electrification Strategy. In a similar vein, reduction of 
the nation’s dependence on fossil fuel and securing long-term energy security is the main visionary 
goal of Nigeria’s Gas Policy.  
 
The  Long-Term  Vision  for  Nigeria  (LTV-2050) which  is  the preparatory  step  towards the 
Development of its Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS) leverages these 
existing or past visions. 
   
   
 
14 Under preparation led by the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget, and National Planning 
13 
  
 
 
3.2  Developing the LTV Vision 
 
The process for the development of the LTV Vision for Nigeria involves the adoption of a number 
of guiding principles and stakeholders’ consultations to identify the main elements of the vision. 
 
3.2.1  Guiding Principles  
 
This vision will be guided by the following principles that have been highlighted in the National 
Climate Change Policy: 
▪  Country-driven  and  country-specific  climate  change  interventions  and  responses. 
Nigeria will think globally but act locally. As a party to the Paris Agreement, Nigeria, 
through a country-driven effort, will contribute to the global efforts to hold the increase in 
the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue 
efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. While doing 
so, Nigeria will partner with other countries in taking robust climate action through 
knowledge  and  technology  transfer.  Such  national  efforts  will  lead  to  reduce  GHG 
emissions and provide an opportunity for sustainable growth and development. 
 
▪  Build  sustainable  and  resilient  economy  and  social  development  with  adequate 
adaptation  response.  For  development  planning  processes,  facilitate  resilience  and 
adaptation to climate change integration in a coherent manner within all relevant sectors 
and at different levels and with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Low carbon 
development compels a rethink of actions to embed new climate economic approaches and 
alignments with high growth sectors. 
 
▪  Effective citizenship participation. This will be key to creating a sustainable environment 
for industrial development and fostering future growth.  The government will provide 
enabling environment for MDAs at all levels, private sector, civil society organizations, 
communities, and donor agencies to optimize the use of energy and transit towards a 
carbon-neutral society.  
 
▪  Shared  vision  social  inclusion,  and  responsibility  among  stakeholders.  The 
transformation of Nigeria towards a low carbon, climate resilient society will take place 
within a broad consensus among various stakeholders, including policymakers, private 
sector, civil society, academia, and local communities. The 2050 vision for Nigeria will be 
based on public support and engagement, and social inclusion.  
 
▪  Identification of low-carbon transition enabling activities. In Europe, Gas, and nuclear 
energy, are examples of transitional activities in full respect of “do no significant harm” 
as  they  are  seen  as  allowing  economic  activities  to  be  labelled  as  environmentally 
sustainable15. In Nigeria, “Natural gas is accepted more or less as a transition fuel, the 
 
15https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room 
14 
  
 
bridge to renewable energy.”16. Thus, whether Nigeria economy could leverage activities 
in gas sector as transition to a low-carbon economy with “no significant harm remains a 
conjecture.” 
 
▪  Promotion of environmental quality and ecological equilibrium. Environmental quality 
and ecological equilibrium will be promoted by moving away from linear economy (fossil-
fuel based production, distribution, and consumption patterns) to circular economy that 
will ultimately enable people to achieve universal goals for environment and health. 
Nature-based solutions will be continuously pursued to accelerate the transition to a low 
carbon society whilst ensuring growth and the economic and social wellbeing of the people. 
 
▪  Transparency,  accountability,  and  equity.  Nigeria  will  ensure  transparency, 
accountability, and equity as it moves towards achieving its mid-century vision. The 
Government will inform the people of the detailed costs to be incurred from this transition 
as well as the benefits of climate action in a transparent manner, as well as ensuring that 
the costs of implementation are borne in a fair and equitable manner by all members of the 
Nigerian society. 
 
▪  Monitoring, evaluation and reporting of all climate change interventions and lessons. 
Government will put in place a robust national monitoring, reporting and verification 
(MRV) system to monitor, evaluate and report on each stage of the transition. It will also 
regularly share information with the people on gains and losses of the transition and seek 
their consent on the way forward based on lessons learnt. 
 
▪  International  partnership  and  cooperation.  Climate  change  is  a  transnational 
phenomenon. There are cross cutting challenges at multi-scale with multistage dimensions. 
Funding  adaptations  places  severe  burden  on  scarce  resources  creating  avenues  for 
maladaptation and adaptation deficit. Meeting urgent climate action of changing world 
requires bilateral and multilateral cooperation. There is the imperative to ratchet green 
climate fund to improve international support if Nigeria will surmount near term climate 
risk as well as promoting a cultural shift needed for the institutionalization of net zero 
emission economy.  Nigeria will need to leverage opportunities for capacity building, 
efficient  energy and  innovations  in  technologies  and  digital  transformations  through 
bilateral and multilateral partnerships and cooperation. 
 
▪  Policy Coordination: The bane of effective climate governance and the green transition is 
poor policy coordination and inconsistencies. Lack of coordination between ministries and 
MDAs in climate change mitigation and adaptation creates gaps and results in gross 
inefficiency. The result of which is that mitigation and ‘greening’ efforts are scattered in 
different sectoral policies with different institutional mandates foisting policy ownership 
crises. Policy coordination will ensure multisectoral coordination; improve the delivery of 
service while also providing the direction for the journey to a carbon just civilization.  
Policy coordination will reduce the coordination gap between different MDAs in the 
 
16 (VP  statement  on  behalf  of    President  Buhari  at  Africa  Regional  Heads  of  Government  Commonwealth 
Roundtable.https://insidebusinessafricang.com/2021/04/16/osinbajo-seeks-fair-transition-towards-global-net-zero-
emissions-target/) 
15 
  
 
adaptation space, reduce overlapping mandates by insisting responsible MDAs are tasked 
with  adaptation  and  mitigation  and  enhance  effectiveness  and  accountability  which 
increased local buy-in and legitimacy. 
 
▪  Good Governance: Good governance underpins all the elements of an LTS: A stable 
environment for the maintenance of the harmonious relationship between humankind and 
nature hinges on good governance. Governance is the bedrock of economic, political, and 
environmental sustainability. The nature and form of governance structure determine the 
level of success achieved in LCD. Good governance is related to  equitable climate 
governance as promoting equity minimizes climate risks, fosters harmony, and builds 
enduring climate structure conversant with the needs of a changing world yet, is mindful 
of intra and inter-temporal equity. 
 
3.2.2  Stakeholders’ Consultation 
 
In the process of developing the vision, representatives of Ministries, Departments and Agencies 
(MDAs) that are either directly or indirectly connected with the planning and implementation of 
NDC activities for Nigeria were consulted for their visionary views on national development in 
the  face  of  expected  impacts  of  climate  change  in  the  country.  This  was  done  through  a 
questionnaire and structured dialogue. The list of stakeholders consulted is given in Annex 2 with 
a summary of the views of various MDAs that were consulted. They all indicated, in qualitative 
terms, the country’s concern for climate change and the desire to move Nigeria’s development in 
the path that will significantly reduce the country’s dependency on fossil fuel, particularly oil, 
while focusing on increasing its reliance on gas and renewables, such as solar and wind, for 
sustainable climate-resilient and climate-compatible development. In this way, it may be said that 
Nigeria will pursue the path of low-carbon development in its immediate and future development 
plans to enable it to meet its obligations towards international commitment to the Paris Agreement 
and to align with anticipated global best practices for sustainable development. Modeling scenarios 
will be developed to depict the trajectory that Nigeria will follow in the course of LT-LEDS 
development  
 
Private  sector  needs  government  enablement  to  create  new  investable  opportunities  that 
encapsulates  visibility,  transparency,  viability,  and  bankability.  The  new  climate  economic 
systems are the overarching economic enablers that leverage use of digitalization and to improve 
efficiency across multiple economic systems such as the circular economy, bioeconomy green, 
blue and food economies amongst others. The extent to which emerging economies like Nigeria 
can spur cities to catalyse sustainable, inclusive, and resilient growth is crucial not only for their 
future, but for the entire world as well. Future sustainable cities would embed industrial parks, 
agro-allied sectors, new housing, manufacturing and trade and commerce to spin out millions of 
new opportunities and jobs for decades to come. Under this scenario, energy and economic growth 
modelling for key economic sectors contributing to low emissions growth with provision to replace 
fossil fuel economy by 2050 would be needed. 
   
16 
  
 
 
 
3.2.3  Main Elements of the Vision 
 
From  the  various  consultations  conducted  among  various  stakeholders,  key  elements  were 
identified in the vision development as depicted in Figure 3. These are also anticipated to 
eventually guide the development of the LT-LEDS for Nigeria.

3.3  The Vision: Where we want to be in 2050. 
 
Nigeria will continue to be part of the global efforts and collective engagements required to 
frontally address the challenges of climate change, while aiming at becoming a high middle-
income economy.  Thus, the LT Vision will be that by 2050, Nigeria is a country of low-carbon, 
climate-resilient, high-growth circular economy that reduces its current level of emission by 
50%, moving towards having net-zero emissions across all sectors of its development in a 
gender-responsive manner. 
 
It is hoped that this vision will promote sustainable development and guarantee a climate proofed 
economic development through multi-stakeholder engagement across multiple sectors that include 
the bioeconomy, blue, green and food economies, especially at this time that Nigeria is also 
engaged  in  developing  medium-term  (2021-2025)  and  long-term  (Agenda  2050)  national 
development plans. It is also expected to lay a solid foundation for Nigeria to contribute to the 
global goal of climate neutrality, and to be a climate-resilient society with a knowledge-driven 
economy that is globally competitive and compliant with Africa’s Agenda 2063, as well as enable 
the country to play its leadership role in Africa effectively. In the long-term, Nigeria’s Long-Term 
strategy must align with key principles of these complexly interrelated strategies and visions to 
enshrine economic growth while also building a climate resilient economy. 
 
 
   
The Vision 
   By 2050, Nigeria is a country of low-carbon, climate-resilient, high-growth 
circular economy that reduces its current level of emission by 50%, moving 
towards having net-zero emissions across all sectors of its development in a 
gender-responsive manner. 
18 
  
 
 
4.  Visions by Sector 
 
The proposed long-term Vision for Nigeria’s LT-LEDS remains largely broad and encompassing 
many sectoral  “visions”  that  would  need  to  be  properly  integrated  for  sustainable  national 
development. The key sectoral “visions” are highlighted in this section of the report. 
 
4.1  Agriculture, Forest, and other Land Use (AFOLU) 
Agriculture, Forestry, and other Land Uses (AFOLU) is a major sector that has the most significant 
contribution to climate change in Nigeria and which also impacts on climate change significantly. 
As agriculture contributes about 24% to the country’s GDP, reducing GHG emissions from this 
sector and adapting the sector to climate change remain critically important for any long-tern vision 
for low carbon development in Nigeria. Destructive land use practices such as deforestation, 
uncontrolled use of fertilizers and poor livestock management contribute significantly to the 
release of GHGs, particularly carbon-dioxide (CO ), nitrous oxide (N O) and methane (CH ). 
2 2 4
According to Nigeria’s Third National Communication submitted to the UNFCCC 2020, total 
GHG emissions from AFOLU stands at 366,734 Gg CO -eq, representing about 60% of the total 
2
net GHG emissions for the country. On the other hand, appropriate land use practices such as 
agroforestry  will  increase  the  carbon  sink  potentials  of  the  sector.  Thus,  this  sector  holds 
significant climate change mitigation potential for Nigeria through reductions of GHG as well as 
enhancement of agricultural sequestration and application of climate smart technologies.  
 
The Vision 20:2020 seeks to improve agricultural productivity by enhancing yield per hectare, 
reducing post-harvest losses, and increasing processing and integration with an industrial value 
chain to feed the nation’s growing population. Reducing GHG emissions from AFOLU offers a 
great opportunity for Nigeria to contribute to land cover changes at global, national, and local 
levels that have characterized human-environment relationship. AFOLU also has both local and 
global benefits to climate change mitigation and whilst supporting millions of smallholder farmers 
adapt to climate change impact.  
 
The major challenge for the country is to reduce its rate of deforestation, which is one of the highest 
in the world. With rapid growth in population and its associated demands on forest and non-forest 
products, the impact of extraction continues to escalate the challenges of deforestation as well as 
de-vegetation, to the extent that only less than 10% of forest cover remains.  Utilizing the country’s 
agricultural resources for food security is also an area of national importance with implications for 
GHG emissions. 
 
To move the AFOLU sector to a LT-LEDS, Nigeria will develop and/or deploy low-carbon 
agricultural adaptation technologies and practices, water management in irrigated rice farms, low-
methane  fodders  for  livestock,  low-input  farming;  development  of  soil  carbon  storage 
methodologies and management; and replacement of fossil fuel with clean energy sources.  The 
Government will pursue Research and Development on these low-carbon farming practices and 
expand education and support for farmers for wider application. The Government will also need 
to scale up certification and labelling of low –carbon agricultural produce, meats or dairy products 
that are produced using farming practices that minimize inputs, such as chemical fertilizers and 
19 
  
 
pesticides. In the urban areas, significant effort will be targeted at (i) optimizing the use of city long 
spaces by diversifying uses, for example agripolis urban farming systems, while promoting urban forms 
that are resilient to the effects of climate change, and (ii) stopping degradation of agricultural, natural and 
forest areas and limiting the drying of wetlands.  
 
Government will sensitize consumers to do their part by generating less food waste and changing 
their dietary habits to reduce their carbon footprints in their daily life. There will be public 
awareness-raising programmes to change people’s consumption patterns and lead them towards a 
low-carbon lifestyle. Best practices and lessons learnt from farming and fishing communities 
elsewhere that use solar, wind and other eco-friendly energy sources will be emulated. Such 
lessons will serve as a model for future lifestyle, balanced national development, and eco-friendly 
energy transition. They will be exhibited as best practices of combining energy transition with 
local development. They will also help Nigeria to be prepared for potential social changes, e.g., 
changing industrial site locations and population migration. 
 
   Increasing resilience to climate change and effectively reducing GHG emissions in the 
AFOLU sector will be feasible within a vision that states that by 2050, Nigeria is a country 
in which sustainable land use and Climate Smart Agriculture (including livestock and 
fisheries) practices are adopted by all large-scale farmers and more than 75% of 
smallholder farmers, while forestry management practices are in line with the global 
mechanism of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+).  
 
 
4.2  Energy 
 
The Third National Communication reported that the total GHG emissions from the energy sector 
stands at 206,452 Gg CO -eq or about 34% of the total net GHG emissions of Nigeria. As the 
2
second major contributor of GHG in Nigeria and given the potential transformational effects for 
the development of other sectors, the energy sector is critical in the country’s effort to reduce GHG 
emissions and pursue long-term low-carbon development.  
 
Visioning for a low carbon development in Nigeria’s energy sector remains a serious challenge, 
as the country’s economic growth is still largely dependent on oil and gas. Nigeria has the second 
largest proven oil reserves in Africa after those of Libya. It has oil reserves of about 35 billion 
barrels  and  gas  reserves  of  about  5.8  trillion  m3,  ranking  10th  and  9th  in  the  world, 
respectively. There is also about 21 million tonnes of proven recoverable bituminous coal 
reserves, including anthracite. 
 
Nigeria in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on oil  and  gas for its economic 
development. It is noted however, the recent past shows that the country faces declining production 
and, in the future, lower global demand and lower prices. The impact of these and low carbon 
scenarios on expected oil and gas revenues would be developed to put things in perspective. 
 
The economic importance of oil and gas makes Nigeria, like other oil and gas producing countries 
of the world economically vulnerable to global efforts to reduce GHG emissions. As global action 
to reduce GHG emissions will necessarily require reduced consumption of fossil fuels, this will 
20 
  
 
affect the country’s main economic base—the extraction and export of oil and gas17. However, 
while  addressing  climate  change  and  reducing  GHG  emissions  presents  challenges  for  the 
country’s development, it is also an opportunity that could intensify the national effort to diversify 
its economy and lead to the development of low-carbon technologies such as carbon capture and 
storage (CCS), energy efficiency technologies and alternative energy. Moreover, the Vision 2020 
singled out the expansion of electric power production from gas and hydropower as a key driver 
of growth. Associated and non-associated gas will increasingly replace the predominantly diesel-
generating sets ubiquitous in companies and homes. As gas prices rise and regulation improves, 
more of the currently flared natural gas will find its way into power production, thereby reducing 
GHG emissions from gas flaring18. With support from international development partners Nigeria 
shall seek to use of gas, as opposed to just flaring, with substitutes diesel generators for large 
installations and renewables would be an alternative. And even in smaller installations. 
 
In addition, Nigeria has renewable and non-renewable energy resources in commercial 
quantities. The main renewable energy resources include sun, wind, hydro, biomass, and 
tidal wave. The Third National Communication concluded that solar energy is the most 
promising renewable energy resource due to Nigeria’s location within the heart of the tropical 
region where sunshine and solar radiation are very abundant and well distributed. The report 
estimated that the available annual solar energy in Nigeria is about 27 times her total fossil 
fuel  resources  and  about  115,000timestheelectricalpowergenerated  in  Africa’s  most 
populous country and largest economy.  
 
A wide variety of mitigation options can be applied in the energy sector. Renewable energies can 
make a major contribution to reducing emission levels. Renewable energy and energy efficiency 
are globally promoted as measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and response to 
climate  change.  The  country’s  Renewable  Energy  Master  Plan  projects  to  2025  of  26.7% 
renewable energy contribution to the Nigeria’s energy use. This was expected to reduce CO  and 
2
GHG emissions at 38% by 2025. In the same vein the country’s NDC energy sectoral plan 
indicated that increasing the current pace of energy efficiency improvement in all sectors of the 
nation’s economy to 2.5 percent per year, could achievee a 40 percent reduction in the amount of 
energy consumption by 2030, measured in terms of energy intensities, and thereby contribute 
significantly to GHG emission reduction in the long run. 
 
The following are needed to move Nigeria in the direction of long-term decarbonisation pathway: 
(i) promote decarbonization goal through carbon market; (ii) embedding innovative technology to 
catalyze green growth; (iii) scale-up the use of natural gas rather than PMS and liquid fuels; (iv) 
scale-up in renewable energy technologies; (v) adopt fiscal incentives to promote renewable 
energy utilization including subsidies, tax holiday, investments, grants and import exemption to 
incentivize prospective investors. In the urban areas, focus will be on energy efficiency in both new 
and  existing  buildings;  design  buildings  to  utilise more  natural  lighting  and  consume  less energy. 
Furthermore, there is need for subsidy reform, carbon tax, eco-labelling, carbon market to send 
long-term policy signals.

The objective of the country’s vision for low-carbon energy is to initiate changes in the energy 
production patterns to significantly increase the renewable energy proportion of the country’s 
energy mix, as well as promote and enforce improvements in energy distribution systems (e.g., 
improved power grids) to avoid inefficient use of energy resources, through the adoption of 
appropriate and new technologies for climate change mitigation. From current realities in Nigeria’s 
energy sector, the 2050 vision for the sector should be anchored to decarbonize the energy sector 
by halving emissions in the sector relative to current levels and increasing the contribution of 
renewables to the country’s energy mix by 50% with a view of achieving net zero carbon 
emission by the end of the century 
 
4.3  Fresh Water and Coastal Wetlands 
 
Nigeria has significant total water resources estimated at 215 billion m3 of surface water and 87 
billion m3 groundwater resources, although with large-scale spatial inequalities in different regions 
of the country. Nigeria’s coastal and marine environment stretches for about 853 km along the 
coastline and inland for about 15km in Lagos in the west to about 150km in the Niger Delta and 
about 25km east of the Niger Delta. However, Nigeria has significant challenges in ensuring proper 
and sustainable management of its water resources for domestic, agricultural, and industrial 
purposes. 
 
It is estimated that the annual total water demand in Nigeria is about 5.93 billion m3. This is 
expected to increase to 16.58 billion m3/year in 2030.According to an analysis in Nigeria’s Water 
Master Plan (2014)19, the projected global warming-induced change in air temperature over 
Nigeria could bring about 20% reduction of annual runoff in the country. Groundwater recharge 
could also be reduced by up to 20% due to influence of the climate change. Additional 5 to 20m 
lowering of groundwater for the whole country is predicted by2030. This would warrant the need 
to drill boreholes at 20m deeper than current depth and make the depth of pump table to attain 20m 
deeper than it is currently. Over-pumping may further aggravate the impact of climate change on 
the lowering of groundwater level and possible ground subsidence effects in the country. This is 
an interesting example of interactions between water, energy, and climate nexus. Due to more 
intense climatic changes and higher air temperature, drought will set in, thus leading to higher 
demand for water. But the lower the groundwater table, the more energy and costs will be needed 
to build and operate deeper infrastructure systems. Depending on the source of the energy, this 
might result in higher emissions or other pressures. 
 
Climate change and climatic variability will further threaten the water supply potential of the 
country as water supplies will be affected, not only for agriculture, but also for industry, energy 
production and even fisheries, in addition to health impacts and threats to biodiversity. In addition, 
it is also important to note that other activities being planned by Nigeria to reduce emissions or 
build resilience may be limited by water or influence available and usable water resources. 
Industry, energy, and agriculture in the same basin or dependent on the same water resource may 
compete for the resource20. This compels the need to manage water and climate change in a more

holistic and coordinated manner imperative. It also informs that the water sector must be part of 
the global effort of limiting global temperature increase to well below 2OC by 2030 as captured in 
the Paris Agreement, and for the NDC is the national implementation policy.  
 
The provision of drinking water and the treatment of wastewater require tremendous amounts of 
energy, the production of which is responsible for high amounts of CO -emissions. For example, 
2
a crude estimate indicates that the supply of 5.93 billion m3 that was estimated as water demand 
(which may also include pumped irrigation water) in 2013 by the WRMP would have resulted in 
the emission of about 4MtCO . Thus, it can be affirmed with some degree of certainty that if water 
2
supply in the country is fully sourced through renewable energy powered sources, then it would 
be  possible  to  achieve  good  targets  for  emissions  reduction  for  the  sector  in  the  NDC 
implementation. Emissions from domestic wastewater in 2016 was estimated to be 1.95MtCO2-
eq. Thus, the inclusion of the water sector in the NDC is evidence of increasing recognition of its 
high potential to reduce energy demand and thus contribute to the overall goal of climate change 
mitigation.  
 
The processes of water extraction, reticulation and treatment offer various mitigation options to 
reduce carbon emissions. The main challenge is to keep the impacts of climate change from 
becoming a disaster to the water sector and water resources more generally. For example, the 
indirect impacts of biogeochemical cycle in dams and drops in hydrostatic pressure during water 
level drawdowns can influence ebullition, which ultimately, will decrease CH  that is further 
4
oxidized to CO  by methane oxidizing microbes. The saga of burning river tributaries in Nigeria’s 
2
Niger Delta region due to incidental oil spills is a grim reminder of water share of emissions 
impacts. Also, the ill managed industrial waste disposal triggered carbon pollution in rivers of 
USA (Cuyahoga-Cleveland 1969, Chicago 1970, Buffalo 1970, and Rouge 1971). These incidents 
clearly  point  to  emissions  warning  symbols  to  humanity  on  impacts  of  inadvertent  water 
management neglect. Similarly, the role of catchment activities in fueling microbial methane 
(Kiene, 1991) and organic matter decomposition (Thorton, 1991) was also reported. In Nigeria, 
the greatest impacts stem from industrial clusters, where steam boilers are used at supercritical 
temperatures for either heating, or processing of consumer goods. The wharfs, seaports and 
marinas also contribute significantly to local GHG emissions because of shippers’ obduracy to 
IMO green flag directives. 
 
The country’s vision for the water sector is to Nigeria minimizes the impact of climate change 
on the sector, improves energy efficiency and increases sector’s resilience for sustainable 
water development, through strategic mitigation and adaptation options. 
 
 
4.4  Industry   
Nigeria’s industrial sector in 2019 contributed about 27% of the nation’s GDP21, despite the 
challenges of inadequate power and infrastructure, quality issues and limited access to finance, as 
well as high cost of energy. Insufficient power generation capacity is driving companies to use

natural gas and diesel to self-generate power. Thus, while their growth and success help to reduce 
the level of unemployment in the country, their rapidly increasing rate of GHG emissions remains 
a source of concern22.  
 
The country’s comprehensive industrial policy is set out in the Nigeria Industrial Revolution Plan 
(2014),  and  it  indicates  that  Nigeria  intends  to  fast-track  the  renaissance  of  the  country’s 
manufacturing industries as a key source of growth, jobs, and food security. With the current use 
of natural gas and diesel to generate power, increasing the industrial output of the country may 
lead to increasing rate of GHG emissions. The NDC sectoral analysis for industry indicates thatthe 
sector’s GHG emissions could increase from 4.2 Mt CO2e in 2010 to 14.8 Mt CO2e in 2030 if no 
measures to improve energy efficiency are implemented23. Thus, government recognizes that as 
the sector grows there must be a coordinated shift to low emission production systems. The use of 
green technology to ensure sustainable efficiency of the development of factory facilities to the 
fabrication and installation of production equipment will reduce the demand for fossil fuels and 
enhance overall efficiency.  
 
Specific industrial energy efficiency plans that will be implemented with the overall objective of 
reducing GHG emissions in the industrial sector include the National Renewable Energy and 
Energy  Efficiency  Policy  (NREEEP)  (2015),  the  National  Energy  Efficiency  Action  Plan 
(NEEAP) (2016), and the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) Action Agenda (2016). In 
particular, the NEEAP sets out several measures that work towards achieving the SE4ALL 
proposed targets for industrial energy efficiency. In the NDC analysis, these targets were to 
improve on 2015 energy consumption levels by 20% by 2020 and by 50% by 2030 through energy 
efficiency24. 
 
Nigeria’s current focus is the use of natural gas to generate power and increase the industrial output 
of the country, while minimizing increasee in GHG emissions to comply with its global obligation 
of low-carbon development. To effectively achieve this goal, the country will need to be well 
positioned to pursue an alternative and sustainable path to industrialisation that takes advantage of 
new innovations, technologies, and business models.  
 
The national vision for the industry sector is that by 2050 Nigeria will have a low carbon industrial 
sector with enhanced energy efficiency that seizes the opportunities that comes with global transition 
towards climate resilience and circular economy. 
This vision will accelerate the country’s industrial development, utilizing energy mix with an 
emphasis  on  renewable  energy  and  promoting  energy  efficiency  networks  for  industrial 
enterprises.     
 
4.5  Urban Settlements 
 
A large share of global GHG emissions is attributable to cities. The International Energy Agency 
(IEA) estimates that urban areas currently account for more than 71% of energy-related global 
 
22Eleri, E. O., Onuvae, P. and Ugwu, O. (2013): Low-carbon energy development in Nigeria: Challenges and opportunities. IIED

24 ibid 
24 
  
 
GHG and this is expected to rise to 76% by 2030, making energy-related emissions the largest 
single source of GHG25.In 2019, 51.16% of Nigeria's total population lived in urban areas and 
cities. The eight largest cities in Nigeria will become even bigger by2030. The population growth 
of Nigeria’s biggest city Lagos will almost double within the next decade to about 20 million 
people. Three other cities will also almost double their population and in the context of the global 
trends, Nigerian cities, where most production activities are taking place, will in the future become 
a major source of GHG emissions from a production-based perspective if emissions are allocated 
to the places where they are generated. Nigerian cities will, therefore, play a major role in the 
country’s  climate  change  mitigation  efforts. Their  main  challenge  will  be  how  to  combine 
sustainable growth, development, and an enhanced quality of life whilst lowering CO - emissions. 
2
 
Effective management of Nigerian urban centre offers the potential to capitalize on the multi-layer 
benefits of mitigation, adaptation, and improved access to services. Cities with excellent services 
are resilient cities: advanced drainage systems can alleviate flooding during intense storms; robust 
healthcare services are equipped to respond to emergencies; warning systems and transportation 
infrastructure allow citizens to evacuate in response to risk. The key requirement is synergy 
between sectors: electricity; water and wastewater; heating; cooling and transport with investments 
in energy efficient heating and cooling of buildings and electrified transport. Main strategic 
approaches may include: 
▪  Promotion of compact urban areas (by curbing urban sprawl) in such a way that reduces 
the need for building on undeveloped land that can instead serve as carbon sinks. 
▪  Strengthen development control functions to avoid haphazard planning and development 
and ensure adoption and implementation of national planning laws by states and local 
government councils. 
 
The national vision for country’s urban sector is for Nigerian cities reduce their carbon 
footprint by 50% by 2050 and move towards becoming carbon-neutral and climate-resilient at 
the end of the century.  
It is worthy to note that Lagos is part of the Climate Ambition Alliance, pledged to Net Zero by 
2050.

4.6  Oil and Gas 
 
Globally,  the  oil  and  gas  sector  are  a  major  source  of  GHG  emissions.  According  to  the 
International Energy Agency’s (IEA) World Energy Outlook 2018, indirect GHG emissions from 
oil and gas operations, including carbon dioxide and methane emissions, make up about 5.2 billion 
tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent, equivalent of about 15% of the world’s energy sector’s total 
GHG emissions. The oil and gas sector in Nigeria contributes up to 14% of the country’s GDP, 
and accounts for 95% of the foreign exchange earnings. It also contributes to 65% of the annual 
federal budget. The country’s NDC indicates that the main GHG emissions in the sector are from 
gas flaring, fugitive methane emissions, on-site fuel use (upstream and midstream) and on-site fuel 
use from refineries as well as artisanal crude refining that is ubiquitous in the Niger Delta area and 
contributes to significant environmental degradation due to the use of artisanal equipment in the 
refining process26. The combined contribution of flaring and venting to the environment is about 
80% of emissions in the sector. The target is to reduce flaring down to less than 10% by the year 
2020 and end it completely by 2030. The strategic approach is to deploy the vast gas resources of 
the country as the major fuel for power generation and to position Nigeria as the African regional 
hub for gas-based industries. 
 
Eliminating flaring by 2030 could save around 64 million tonnes of CO  per year and have large 
2
development co-benefits. This target is achievable if the right legislation and strategies are 
implemented. The Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization Programme (NGFCP) (2016), Nigerian 
Gas Policy (2017), Flare Gas (Prevention of Waste and Pollution) Regulation (2018) and the 
Petroleum  Industry  Roadmap  as  well  as  the  Nigeria  Gas  Masterplan  contain  well  defined 
propositions to achieve the target27.  
 
Critical policy measures that can be advanced for a carbon neutral oil and gas sector in Nigeria, as 
indicated in the National Climate Change Policy, will include: 
▪  Pursue green jobs and just transition strategy to attain low-carbon transition for oil and gas 
sector plus a strategy that anticipate and accommodate stranded assets in the country. 
▪  Supporting low-cost, technically feasible solutions to reduce methane emissions in oil and 
gas operations, including recovery and use of escaping gas. 
▪  Incentivizing the deployment of natural gas as Nigeria’s major transition fuel for power 
generation, industrialization, and domestic use, particularly cooking, towards ending gas 
flaring and anticipating e what comes after gas in two – three decades. 
▪  Facilitating  sustainable  regulatory  frameworks  and  incentives,  as  well  as  financial 
mechanisms to end gas flaring by 2030. 
▪  Investment and use of smart technologies in oil refining; and 
▪  Reducing fugitive emissions in the sector  
 
The national vision in the sector will be to reduce carbon emission from Nigeria’s oil and gas 
value chains by 50% of its current level by 2050 and transit to net zero emission by the end of the 
century.

4.7  Transport 
 
The transport sector is the backbone of any productive system; enabling the mobility of people and 
goods means connecting people and nations and fostering economic and cultural exchanges and 
social development.   It is a major emitter of GHGs in Nigeria, and accounts for nearly one-tenth 
of total Nigerian emissions (Eleri et al., 2013)28. However, by 2016 it accounted for 31.9% of total 
emissions  in  Nigeria.29Cervigni  et  al  (2013)  indicated  that  between  2010  and  2035  fuel 
consumption in the sector is projected to increase by 680%, driven by a five-fold increase in total 
vehicle kilometers driven and induced by greater level of growth observed in the commercial 
vehicle fleet increasing importance of non-oil products in Nigeria’s manufacturing industries, as 
well as the expansion of the service sector due to rising incomes, and the removal of the gasoline 
subsidy that makes the use of heavy diesel-fueled vehicles more attractive. GHG emissions are 
forecast to increase significantly over the same period, driven by increasing population, economic 
activity, and wealth. The complexity of the transport sector requires deploying a diverse mix of 
decarbonization solutions to meet the challenges within each of its four main segments: roadways, 
railways, aviation, and navigation. 
 
Government’s  response  to  minimizing  GHG  emissions  in  the  sector,  as  elaborated  in  the 
transport’s sectoral plan for the NDC is a fast, safe, efficient, affordable, integrated, and inter-
modal transport system for goods and people. It is targeted at reducing GHG emissions by about 
4MtCO e by year by 2030, whereas the projected rise in emissions is projected at over 25times of 
2
that value. This obviously is not an adequate target for country that intends to be carbon neutral by 
2050.The  national  transport  policy  also  seeks  to  expand  rail  infrastructure,  improve  road 
construction and maintenance as well expand urban collective transportation, among other pursuits 
These  are  all  important  elements  in  a  green  transportation  strategy  that  will  require  the 
institutionalization of appropriate behavioural and social modifications among Nigerians as well 
as the development of technological capacities in the area of clean technologies such as zero 
emission vehicles (ZEVs). It will also require the adoption of integrated land use and transportation 
systems that will connect housing, jobs, schools, and communities through a variety of integrated 
low-carbon mobility solutions. In the urban areas, emphasis will be on (i) expansive adoption of 
mass transit system such as the Rail and Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) to reduce number of 
commuter vehicles on the road and curb emission; and (ii) encouraging the acquisition and use of 
zero-emission vehicles such as electric cars.  
 
The long-term vision in the transport sector that can move the country toward carbon neutrality is 
a national transportation system by 2050 with all having access to a range of affordable 
transportation choices in which not more than 50% of all journeys are by cars, at least 40% of 
all journeys are by public transport (including trains and BRT) and at least 10% of all journeys 
are by active travel (e. g. cycling, walking) to generate little to no GHG, keep the air clean, 
reduce vehicle distance traveled while increasing access and grow the economy. 
Increased transportation efficiency and ubiquitous, safe, and affordable access to low-carbon 
transportation options are key to the success of the vision.

27 
  
 
4.8  Waste 
 
Waste  generation  has  consistently  increased  in  Nigeria  due  to  increase  in  population, 
intensification  in  socioeconomic  development,  industrialization,  changing  lifestyles  and 
consumption patterns. The quantity and rate of solid wastes generation in Nigeria have outgrown 
the capacity of existing facilities and structure put in place to manage them, therefore this has been 
of great concern across many Nigerian cities. Domestic solid waste generation rate per annum in 
Nigeria is currently estimated at 63 million tonnes (0.45 kg/capital/annum) and is increasing30. 
 
The Third National Communication indicates that waste sector in Nigeria accounts for about 4% 
of the total net national emission of 609,783Gg CO -eq. This is expected to increase over the years 
2
due to increasing resource use by the rapidly increasing population of the country that is set to 
reach over 400 million by 2050. 
 
The poor management of waste in Nigeria has led to indiscriminate disposal or discharge of waste 
into unintended ecosystem, thus causing blockages of drainages channels and diffused flooding; 
degradation of aesthetic values of cities across the nation; uncontrolled burning of wastes and 
emission of poisonous gases into the atmosphere; leachate contamination of water and soil 
resources;  pollution  from  discharged  toxic  wastes  amongst  others.  These  constitute  both 
environmental and health hazards and contribute to GHG emissions from the sector and across the 
waste  management  chain  including  collection,  transportation,  treatment,  and  landfill.  These 
uncontrolled emissions in turn contribute to the negative impacts of global warming issues across 
the globe. The largest source is usually landfill methane (CH4), followed by wastewater CH4 and 
nitrous oxide (N2O); in addition, minor emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) result from the 
incineration of waste containing fossil carbon (C) (plastics; synthetic textiles). 
 
The key approaches to waste handling for GHG removals and overall climate mitigation include 
recycling, waste reduction, waste to wealth and energy recovery from wastes. The main policy 
direction is to significantly lower emissions from the sector with appropriate waste management 
and wastewater treatment solutions. Emphasis will be on post-consumer urban solid waste, as well 
as emissions from municipal wastewater and industrial wastewaters. Other areas of focus may 
include pre-consumer GHG emissions from waste within the industrial and energy sectors, 
agricultural wastes and manures and forestry residues. A wide range of mature, environmentally 
effective  technologies  will  be  deployed  to  mitigate  emissions  and  provide  public  health, 
environmental protection, and sustainable development co-benefits, such as an improvement in air 
quality, a reduction in contamination-related illnesses, economic growth, and a boost to energy 
resources. 
 
The objective is to sustainably reduce GHG emissions in the sector through the implementation of 
an integrated solid waste management strategy, including targeting waste prevention, recycling, 
composting, energy recovery, treatment, and disposal, which can have a significant impact on 
reducing GHG emissions. A strategic approach will be to reduce the amount of waste generated at 
source and create a virtuous cycle where resources are renewed, reused, or recycled repeatedly 
within a circular economy framework. This could be achieved by maximizing resource efficiency 
 
30 FME (2018): National Policy on the Environment 
28 
  
 
and minimizing resource inputs throughout the entire product life cycle – from extraction of natural 
resources to production, distribution, and consumption of products, to recycling and disposal of 
waste. 
 
The national vision is the reduction of GHG emissions from the sector by at least 50% by 2050, 
while transiting to a carbon-neutral waste management at the end of the century through 
expansive adoption of up-to-date technologies for solid, liquid, and gaseous waste (MSW) 
processing and other emerging technologies. 
 
4.9  Cross-cutting: Gender inclusion 
 
There is a global recognition that women play an important role in climate change adaptation and 
mitigation  because  of  their  roles  in  core  climate  change  sectors:  farming  and  livestock 
management, energy, disaster risk reduction, transport, forestry, water management and health. An 
analysis by the UNDP (2016) indicates that women participate in mitigation-related activities 
through their selection and use of fuel for cooking and household tasks as well as transport-related 
needs and practices, they are important energy users, suppliers and consumers, and household 
energy managers and savers; thereby potentially capable of contributing to GHG mitigation that 
in the long-term move the world towards carbon-neutrality. Because of the different roles and 
responsibilities of women and men, which vary by socioeconomic level as well as by region, there 
are  gender  differences  in  the  impacts  of  climate  change,  responses  to  climate  change, 
vulnerabilities to climate change, and the capacities to adapt. Moreover, women’s local and 
environmental knowledge and survival strategies are major ingredients for recovery and resilience 
(UNDP, 2016)31. 
 
Envisioning a gender-based just, long-term low emission strategy for Nigeria will require a whole 
of society approach that intentionally seeks to close pervasive gender inequality gaps skewed 
against women as well as leveraging on opportunities that low carbon development might open for 
a sustainable future. The national approach will be to adopt the general UNFCCC principles of32: 
▪  Ensuring  the  equal  participation  of  men  and  women  in  decision-making  and 
implementation around adaptation and mitigation.  
▪  Ensuring that women can act as agents of change at different levels of the adaptation and 
mitigation process.  
▪  Promoting mitigation approaches that are aware of gender implications and outcomes and 
working towards gender equality and positive impacts on the lives of women through 
improving  livelihoods  and  health  and  allowing  time  for  the  pursuit  of  additional 
opportunities. 
▪  Adoption of clean, sound, socially appropriate and gender responsive technologies; among 
others. 
 
A gender  aware  technology  assessment  for low carbon development  will  ensure  gender is 
mainstreamed and harmful and/ risky technologies are locked out. Overall, the focus shall be to 
mainstream gender considerations into all actions and leverage on existing forward-looking

practices to foster equitable institutions and systems for a paradigm shifting transition to net 
zero carbon and climate resilient future that will benefit all equally.  
 
The vision should successfully mainstream the gender equality and social inclusion initiatives 
(GESI) and capture inclusivity for women, aged people, youth and persons living with disabilities 
by actions to embed affirmative action policies.  
 
 
30 
  
 
5  Role of Innovation 
 
Achieving  a  low  emission  development  future  for  Nigeria  in  the  context  of  the  projected 
population increase and economic growth requires that a strong emphasis be placed on the role of 
innovation. There will be needed to embed technological, policy, governance, economic and 
environmental innovation, among others. 
 
5.1  Social Innovation 
Social change necessitates social innovation to reorient societal values. In transitioning to a carbon 
neutral future there is the imperative for social innovation to produce green cities who consume 
and relate with nature equitably. A genuine transition to a green economy demands fundamental 
changes to both macro-economic and micro-economic conditions—and, therefore, institutions. 
Business as usual with respect to economic policy is not a viable alternative to meet the challenges 
of the future demands of mankind's desire to fundamentally redesign things and create new 
institutions without re-thinking social innovations that suit new demands.  
 
5.2  Economic Innovation 
The tension and lack of progress witnessed in the implementation of climate action so far in Nigeria 
is largely due to different goals and aspirations pulling the nation in different directions. Nigeria 
has expressed a long-term aspiration to be a low carbon and climate-friendly economy, but 
prevailing  economic  circumstances  have  often  imposed  constraints  over  the  abilities  of 
government to take a low carbon route to development mainly due to the significant investments 
required for infrastructure and other costs. Nigeria’s long-term Vision encapsulated in the Vision 
20:2020 blueprint (to be revised) and the ERGP was to make the country a high middle-income 
economy, but with little consideration for low carbon development approach. Conversely, in the 
Paris Agreement the nation also acceded to carry out aggressive and binding cuts in her GHG 
without having the budgets to make it happen. To plant the country firmly on an LTS path, there 
is a need to redefine the economic innovation approaches to diversify the economy and address 
the unacceptable trade-offs between economic growth and environmental sustainability.  
 
5.3  Technological Innovation 
Innovation in technology is essential for achieving Nigeria’s LTV. Technological innovations 
utilize advance technologies to mitigate climate change. Globally, much of the progress made in 
decoupling  emissions  from  development  in  the  energy  sector  has  come  from  technology 
innovation including in generation, storage, energy efficiency and Carbon Capture and Storage 
(CSS) and renewable energy. Fastest advancement have been made where there is technological 
convergence, a process where merging, blending, integration, and transformation of independent 
technologies leads to a completely new converged technology. This broad and complex concept 
encompasses a wide range of technologies, including the internet of things (IoT) and smart home 
devices. Examples include TV, internet, phones, home –smart, climate Smart Agriculture, energy-
smart and water-smart technologies. It is vital that Nigeria invests in promoting these technologies, 
along with the diffusion of indigenous technology innovations as a thrust for its LT-LEDS. 
 
5.4  Environmental Innovation 
31 
  
 
 
Nigeria’s  LTV  deserves  environmental  innovation  that  is  focused  on  organizational 
implementation  and  change.  Environmental  innovation  encompasses  many  different  aspects 
including economic, social, and technological change in way of doing things designed to promote 
environmental  integrity.  The  focus  is  on  the  environment,  with  implication  for  products, 
manufacturing  processes  and  marketing  with  degrees  of  novelty.  It  includes  emphasis  on 
conversation but also distribution of wealth within the nation to reduce disparities between rich 
and poor and achieve social and economic justice. It calls for precaution and the use of science to 
enhance social and environmental outcomes, through the identification of environmental risks and 
externalities  as  well  as  incorporating  such  externalities  in  national  economic  accounting 
frameworks. It entails using strategic, coordinated, and integrated planning to deliver sustainable 
development, the green economy and poverty alleviation but also that citizens should have access 
to information concerning the environment, as well as the opportunity to participate in decision-
making processes. 
   
32 
  
 
 
6.  Way Forward and Elaboration of the LT-LEDS 
 
Nigeria’s LTV has been validated and launched at the highest level of governance in Nigeria. It 
can thus be submitted to the UNFCCC under Art 4.19, as Nigeria's first contribution towards the 
elaboration of its LT-LEDS. The LTV lays a solid foundation for the elaboration of Nigeria’s 
robust LT-LEDS and identifies the critical dimensions that policy-makers, private sector and 
society at large will need clarity on, to get on track for a low-carbon, climate-resilient transition.   
 
It is anticipated that the LT-LEDS for Nigeria will be developed and pursued in a robust and 
consistent manner that will take the nation to 2050 on a low-carbon trajectory for the next 30 years.  
 
Tentative building blocks for the elaboration of Nigeria’s LT-LEDS are presented in Figure 4. The 
questions posed by stakeholders that will guide the LT-LEDS process are presented in Annex I. 
Annex II provides the suggested process(es) for inclusiveness and robustness by stakeholders to 
be considered during the elaboration of Nigeria’s LT-LEDS.

reach the world’s 1.5 °C target? 
6.  Do we have negative-emission technologies (NETs) that would safely and permanently remove 
carbon already accumulated in the atmosphere in Nigeria? 
7.  How will a shift to more circular business models reduce CO2 emissions and help cut the use of 
materials and natural resources while maintaining economic growth? 
8.  An end of international funding for gas as a fossil fuel would create dire challenges for gas-
producing countries, especially in Africa, as recently said by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi

Annex 2: Suggested Process(es) for Inclusiveness and Robustness for the LT-
LEDS Elaboration for Nigeria. 
 
Although the Paris Agreement invited countries to formulate and communicate a LT-LEDS by 
2020, the scope and elements to be included in the LT-LEDS are not clearly defined. For 
Nigeria to envision a low-emission development and national socio-economic development 
pathway in an integrated and strategic manner, a robust and an inclusive LT-LEDS is required. 
Key areas for consideration include but not limited to the following: 
 
a. Policy alignment  
Nigeria’s LT-LEDS process must be aligned with other national programmes and strategies 
such as ERGP, Mid-term National Development Plan and Agenda 2050, NDC, Climate Change 
and other related ones. Linking these policies and strategies will help Nigeria identify long-
term opportunities from the short-term actions in the NDC, Climate change policy and other 
related national strategies.   
 
b. Identification Entry points for the implementation of LT-LEDS 
An in depth understanding of national circumstances and national development priorities and 
existing climate strategies can constitute important entry points for developing LT-LEDS. For 
instance, Nigeria’s NDC and Climate Change policy have already identified priority climate 
mitigation  and  adaptation  opportunities.  There  are  existing  institutional  and  regulatory 
frameworks in place that can be leveraged and improved upon through lessons learned for the 
development of the LT-LEDS.  
 
c. Strong Interagency coordination  
The LT-LEDS process will require strong interagency collaboration and coordination across 
Federal, State and Local governments as well as the private sector to establish a unified effort 
and to maximize available resources in a collaborative manner. 
 
d. Stakeholder’s engagement  
To create the support needed for the LT-LEDS in the short-, medium- and long-run, strong 
stakeholders’  engagement  is  required.  Involving  the  public  through  regular  stakeholder 
consultations processes will contribute to improving the quality of the LT-LEDS.  
e. Robust finance and investment   
The LT-LEDS process will only succeed if there are clear roadmaps for sustainable funding 
and investment.  
 
f. Robust MRV 
There will be need to have clear mechanisms and templates for monitoring, reporting, and 
verifying the LT-LEDS process.
