Foreword 
The Kingdom of Cambodia, as a country vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, understands the 
urgency of ambitious climate action. Although Cambodia bears very little responsibility for the 
historical and current climate crisis, we have consistently responded to international calls for action 
on climate change and contributed to the efforts, in line with our capacities and responsibilities under 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
As announced by Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen, Prime Minister of the Kingdom 
of Cambodia, during the 2020 United Nations Climate Ambition Summit, this “Long-Term Strategy 
for Carbon Neutrality (LTS4CN)” is yet another testament to our consistent, strong commitment and 
political will to address climate change.  
We are proud to be among the very first members of the Least Developed Country group to submit 
this long-term strategy. This is a highly significant step for a developing country like Cambodia. This 
also reflects leading by example on climate change action on the part of Cambodia, a strong supporter 
of multilateral action on climate change. 
This LTS4CN essentially aims to serve as a roadmap or vision document based on a comprehensive 
analysis and modelling of all relevant economic sectors, and it looks several decades ahead. It outlines 
priority mitigation actions for each sector to achieve the country’s goal of a carbon neutral economy 
in 2050.  The strategy largely builds on existing commitments of the Royal Government and proposes 
a  trajectory  consistent  with  the  Updated  Nationally  Determined  Contribution.  It  takes  into 
consideration the balance between emissions reductions, economic growth, social justice, and 
climate resilience. Economic analysis shows that the investments to be made under this strategy have 
the potential to create 449,000 additional jobs, and deliver an additional 2.8% of annual GDP growth 
by 2050 for Cambodia. We can achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 through continued efforts to 
address the forest sustainability and land use; decarbonize our power sector and pursue higher 
energy efficiency; as well as promote low-carbon agriculture, industrial processes, and waste 
management. 
The vision set out in this document will be regularly updated and may be amended as needed to 
reflect any evolving trends or unforeseen events. It provides an overall policy direction, while the 
exact commitments and programmes of the Royal Government will continue to be articulated in our 
Five-Year National Strategic Development Plans and corresponding sector plans. 
We believe that this LTS4CN will help Cambodia to achieve carbon neutrality, which will be our major 
contribution to the sustainable development in Cambodia and the world. 
It is worth acknowledging here our inter-ministerial team who diligently took up the challenge to 
develop this LTS4CN through a year-long process of intensive discussion and consultations among 
international and national experts, concerned ministries, and key relevant stakeholders. 
Our acknowledgement also goes to all our valued partners who have contributed to the development 
of this important document, including, but not limited to, the Cambodia Climate Change Alliance 
programme  (funded  by  the  European  Union,  Sweden,  and  the  United  Nations  Development 
Programme), the United Kingdom, the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations, Global Green Growth Institute, and Agence Française de Développement.

Cambodia’s Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality    iv 
  
Executive Summary 
An innovative visioning exercise for Cambodia 
By presenting this Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality (LTS4CN)1, Cambodia demonstrates 
her commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and presents a policy scenario to realize 
a vision of a carbon neutral and resilient society within the next 30 years. The LTS4CN is a new type 
of policy tool for Cambodia. As a visioning exercise, it is not meant to replace or supersede existing 
national and sectoral strategies of the Government but rather to guide future policy and investment 
decisions by all concerned stakeholders. 
The LTS4CN will possibly be reviewed every five years, in line with the framework for updating 
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. This will provide an 
opportunity to refresh the LTS4CN and reflect the latest trends in policy, technology, and financing 
as well as any unforeseen external events. 
Developing the strategy was a collective effort that included contributions from relevant ministries 
and agencies as well as technical experts. A two-stage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions modelling 
approach applied sector models to the agriculture, forestry and other land use (FOLU), industrial 
processes and product use (IPPU), energy, and waste sectors. A combined pathway model indicated 
the socioeconomic impacts of proposed measures.  
The process started with defining relevant existing policy targets and action plans in national and 
sectoral strategies as well as in the Updated NDC issued in 2020. An intensive round of consultations 
led to the identification of priority mitigation actions for each sector. Different scenarios were 
developed to explore how these actions can reduce emissions and help achieve carbon neutrality, 
compared to business as usual (BAU). An economic modelling estimated the socioeconomic costs 
using the marginal abatement cost model.  Adaptation benefits were elaborated for suggested 
mitigation actions. 
A credible scenario for carbon neutrality by 2050 
The LTS4CN modelling suggests that Cambodia could achieve carbon neutrality in 2050 with the 
FOLU sector providing a total carbon sink of 50 megatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO e). The 
2
energy sector is expected to be the highest emitter in 2050 at 28 MtCO e, followed by the agriculture 
2
sector at 19 MtCO e. The waste and IPPU sectors are projected to emit 1.6 and 1.2 MtCO e, 
2 2
respectively (Table 1).

Total  156.0  155.6  0,3 
*The FOLU sector uses the national forest definition and soils have been included into the calculations. 
 
The LTS4CN proposes a trajectory for decarbonization that is largely aligned with the updated NDC 
trajectory. It incorporates some carbon sinks not previously considered in the NDC, however, 
including an updated sink factor for forests remaining forests (in line with the second Forest 
Reference Level Report), and for plantations and forest soils. This leads to a lower estimate of total 
GHG emissions, at around 35 MtCO e less in 2020 compared to the NDC. 
2
Cambodia’s vision for carbon neutrality is largely founded on the continued implementation of 
existing commitments in the FOLU sector. Execution of the REDD+ Investment Plan2 will drive 
reduced rates of deforestation as well as an expansion of afforestation and reforestation activities. 
The FOLU sector is expected to provide a significant carbon sink leaving room for other sectors to 
incrementally transition towards carbon neutrality.

During the first decade of the strategy, emissions reductions are achieved in the FOLU sector by 
starting implementation of the REDD+ Investment Plan. Once it is fully financed, it is expected to 
reduce the deforestation rate by 50 percent in 2030 compared to the REDD+ baseline specified in the 
updated NDC (reduce 50percent of historical emission). From 2030 onwards, reforestation and 
afforestation efforts will continue with a raised level of ambition to ensure that the carbon sink from 
                                                             
2 REDD+ refers to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, fostering conservation and 
sustainable management of forests, and enhancing forest carbon stocks.

forests continues to grow. The FOLU sector is expected to be carbon neutral from 2031. Afforestation 
and reforestation efforts will be compatible with growth in the agricultural sector because of 
expected gains in productivity and climate resilience. Deforestation is assumed to stop by 2045, with 
the  FOLU  sector  becoming  both  resilient  and  sustainable,  transformed  by  agroforestry  and 
reforestation as two dynamic mitigation actions. Land dedicated to sustainable plantations and 
agroforestry is assumed to constantly increase to reach 1.6 million hectares under afforestation and 
reforestation  mitigation  actions  and  1.1  million  hectares  of  native  forest  restoration.3 These 
combined actions will result in a carbon sink of 50 MtCO e in 2050. 
2
In the energy sector, emissions reductions until 2030 come from energy efficiency and conservation 
through the implementation of the National Energy Efficiency Policy4 in buildings, industry, and 
public services. This will limit growth in energy demand even as demand for energy services rises 
rapidly. Additionally, policies will be developed and put into place to incentivize switching to 
electricity for cooking and passenger vehicles, and to coal alternatives in the industrial sector. Major 
long-term infrastructural changes in the energy sector will be studied and prepared in this first 
decade. After 2030, energy sector emissions reductions will come from more stringent energy 
efficiency standards and continued fuel switching to low-carbon sources. Initial steps to decarbonize 
the electricity supply will be taken, with some investments in renewable energy and gas. With natural 
gas used as a transition fuel in the power sector, investments in infrastructure for imports, storage 
and transportation will be necessary. In the last decade of the LTS4CN scenario, between 2040 and 
2050, the power sector will start a deeper decarbonization journey by adding more renewable 
energy in the generation mix, reaching a share of 35 percent in 2050. Within the renewable energy 
share, 12 percent is assumed to come from solar. Investments in grid modernization, flexibility and 
storage will be required during this transition. 
In the transportation sector, urban public transportation will become more widespread and electric 
vehicle penetration will grow in the passenger vehicle fleet. Investments in rail development will 
start after 2030. Emissions will be also reduced by more moderate use of electric vehicles, increased 
fuel efficiency for internal combustion engine vehicles and higher penetration of compressed natural 
gas (CNG) for interregional buses and for trucks. Under the LTS4CN scenario, 70 percent of 
motorcycles and 40 percent of cars and urban buses are expected to be electric vehicles by 2050. 
The waste sector will achieve half of its emission savings in the first decade through mitigation 
measures  in  solid  waste  disposal,  for  example,  by  diverting  organic  waste  from  landfills  or 
introducing the effective management of landfill gas. Other important mitigation measures are linked 
to reducing open burning and domestic wastewater. A small but increasing share of emissions 
savings will be achieved through introducing good practices in the biological treatment of solid waste. 
In 2050, the waste sector is expected to realize nationwide waste collection coverage of 85 percent 
and will be almost fully decarbonized. The recycling rate will increase to 35 percent; 50 percent of 
organic waste will be composted or treated. Most urban dwellings will have access to proper 
wastewater treatment. And the principle of reduce, reuse, and recycle will be mainstreamed into the 
national development agenda, including through environmental, social and economic plans, policies, 
strategies, and programmes. 
Mitigation actions in the agriculture sector are expected to be implemented gradually over the 30-
year period. Major reductions will be achieved by reducing methane-intensive rice and livestock 
production, and promoting composting and producing biogas in livestock management, organic 
fertilizer, and deep fertilizer technology.  
Major mitigation actions for the IPPU sector will start in the first decade of the LTS4CN scenario, with 
emissions projected to peak in the early 2030s before dropping steeply until 2040. Between 2040 
and 2050, emissions will fall gradually. Key mitigation actions in the sector are clinker substitution

and carbon capture and storage in cement production, recycling of aggregate concrete, increased use 
of refrigerants with low global warming potential and regular inspection of refrigeration and air-
conditioning equipment as well as recovery of spent refrigerants. 
The LTS4CN pathway delivers net economic benefits reaching 2.8 percent of GDP by 2050 
Economic analysis of the LTS4CN suggests net economic benefits for the public and private sectors, 
in addition to adaptation and wider social and environmental benefits. These net benefits start from 
the first year of LTS4CN implementation and reach more than US $4.2 billion in 2050, over 2.8 
percent of projected GDP. Wider social and environmental benefits including adaptation co-benefits 
from LTS4CN actions are estimated to be worth more than the economic benefits, at nearly $7 billion 
in 2050. 
By 2050, the private sector is projected to invest nearly $1.4 billion each year, mostly in energy, 
transportation, and the forestry sectors, with some significant investment in the IPPU sector. Benefits 
in terms of private sector operating expenses are over six times the investment and come from a wide 
range of actions. Significant benefits come from energy efficiency ($3.4 billion), vehicle electrification 
($1.1 billion) and rail and freight haulage ($1.1 billion). These are reduced by $800 million in 
opportunity costs from protecting forests from conversion to agriculture. Public capital expenditures 
are relatively small, with some ongoing investment in renewable energy, buses, trains, and forestry, 
in line with the REDD+ Implementation Plan. There are significant ongoing public operating expenses, 
dominated by rail and haulage ($500 million) and the loss of a fuel tax from the electrification of 
vehicles ($200 million). These costs are offset by operating profits from renewable energy. The net 
contribution of agriculture, waste, and IPPU sectors is small.  
Implementing the LTS4CN will require substantial public investment over 30 years (Figure 2). A 
proposed public financing plan suggests devoting 1 percent of new public borrowing to the LTS4CN 
and making a small shift to divert 3 percent of public spending on economic services to LTS4CN 
actions. These two measures provide 40-50 percent of financing needs. The financing plan assumes 
that pricing policies and taxation reform in the transportation sector will be introduced gradually 
and cover 90 percent of transportation sector costs by 2050. 
The financing plan also assumes that international climate finance will meet the remainder of public 
finance needs. This will cover major investment in public transportation and rail freight, support in 
the forestry sector, and financing for carbon capture and storage, and grid flexibility. International 
climate finance is essential for Cambodia to implement the LTS4CN scenario.

Achieving Cambodia’s LTS4CN scenario is an ambitious but feasible goal. Realizing it depends on a 
comprehensive enabling environment, sufficient access to technology and climate financing, and 
extensive capacity building, and education.  
With reducing emissions to net zero by 2050 critical to meeting the Paris Agreement goal of keeping 
the global average temperature increase below 1.5°C, Cambodia is committed to leading the way. The 
LTS4CN is an important starting point in providing guidance on how it can reach carbon neutrality

Cambodia’s Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality    5 
  
1. Introduction and Background 
1.1.  Global and local context of climate change 
Science has made it clear that the Earth’s climate is changing, in every region and across the global 
climate system. Most of these changes are unprecedented. According to the latest report from the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climate action in the next decades is crucial to 
limit global warming. Staying below a temperature rise of 1.5°C or even 2°C will be nearly impossible 
if immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in GHG emissions do not take place.5 Improved 
observational data sets to assess historical warming and better scientific understanding of the 
response of the climate system have affirmed that human activities are responsible for the majority 
of global warming since 1850. 
The Royal Government of Cambodia is committed to combating climate change and accelerating the 
transition to a climate-resilient, low-carbon, sustainable mode of development. Cambodia has been a 
party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change since 1996, the Kyoto 
Protocol  since  2002,  and  the  Paris  Climate  Agreement  since  2017.  Accordingly,  the  country 
submitted her first NDC in 2015 and the Updated NDC in 2020, highlighting ambitious targets to 
reduce emissions and strengthen adaptive capacity in line with Cambodia’s national policies and 
strategies. 
In the Updated NDC, Cambodia aims to reduce emissions by around 42 percent from 155 MtCO2e 
under BAU to 90.5 MtCO e by 2030.6 The first national Biennial Update Report was submitted in 2020, 
2
which includes emissions from 1994 to 2016. Total emissions in 2016 reached 163.6 MtCO e. The 
2
FOLU sector is the largest source of emissions in Cambodia.7 
1.2.  Developing Cambodia’s long-term strategy 
Development of the Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality (LTS4CN) concluded in 2021. It 
provides a detailed, evidence-driven guide to help Cambodia take long-term climate actions aligned 
with the Paris Agreement commitment to limiting global warming to 1.5°C. It includes institutional 
arrangements for long-term planning, development of a monitoring and evaluation framework, and 
analysis of financial options and socioeconomic impacts of selected priority actions.  
Developing the LTS4CN included planning (Phase 1) and strategy development (Phase 2). The 
planning phase encompassed a literature review of key documentation and data sets and a vision-
setting exercise based on desk research. The collection of baseline emissions information in five key 
sectors, namely FOLU, energy, agriculture, IPPU, and waste, was accompanied by an exploration of 
decarbonization pathways used or proposed in Cambodia so far. Phase 1 involved the development 
of a plan for the strategy development. 
The outcomes of Phase 1 were consistent with a vision of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 through 
upscaling existing mitigation activities and adding new activities. The study concluded that the main 
contributors to emissions in Cambodia are the FOLU, agriculture, and energy sectors. Reaching net 
zero by 2050, therefore, requires more focus on decarbonizing these sectors. In the FOLU sector, the 
main driver of emissions is the expansion of industrial agriculture, while in agriculture, a key source

Figure 4: Overall methodology for Phase 2 of developing the LTS4CN  
The Department of Climate Change of the General Secretariat of the National Council for Sustainable 
Development/Ministry of Environment and Cambodia Climate Change Alliance Phase 3 coordinated 
the development of the LTS4CN with support from development partners such as the United Nations 
Development Programme, Agence Française de Développement, Global Green Growth Institute, the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the European 
Union, and the World Bank. 
A two-stage GHG emissions modelling exercise was employed, consisting of sector models for the 
agriculture, FOLU, IPPU, energy, and waste sectors, and a combined pathway model including a 
socioeconomic cost and benefit analysis. Intensive consultation with all relevant stakeholders from 
line ministries and other key institutions discussed priority mitigation actions and validated data, 
assumptions, and approaches. This ensured that suggested LTS4CN actions would be feasible and 
aligned with Cambodia’s development priorities and at the same time targeted to the goal of carbon 
neutrality by 2050.

2. Cambodia’s Vision for Carbon Neutrality 
2.1.  LTS4CN objectives and scenarios 
The LTS4CN outlines a vision of a carbon neutral economy and provides long-term policy direction 
on how to reduce emissions in the next few decades. The overall goal of the strategy is to describe a 
pathway towards a country-wide carbon neutral economy by 2050.  
2.1.1.  The BAU scenario 
Summarizing findings from sector analysis and modelling, under a BAU scenario, emissions are 
expected to increase at an annual rate of 1.9 percent up to 156 MtCO e. Figure 5 illustrates this 
2
emissions pathway. The FOLU sector has the highest share of total emissions, at 63percent in the 
base year of 2016. In 2050, 53 percent of total emissions is expected to come from the energy sector, 
followed by agriculture at 22 percent and FOLU at 14 percent. The smallest emitters are estimated 
to be the IPPU and waste sectors, with shares of 7 percent and 4 percent, respectively. The BAU 
scenario for the LTS4CN differs from the NDC BAU scenario primarily because additional carbon 
sinks have been incorporated in the analysis. The carbon sink factor for forests remaining forests has 
been aligned with the second Forest Reference Level Report recently submitted by Cambodia, and 
the carbon sink from forest soils has been added along with the sink from plantations included in the 
national forest definition.

 Agriculture  Energy  FOLU  IPPU  Waste BAU Balance
 
Figure 5: GHG emissions projections in the BAU scenario by sector 
In the agriculture sector, rice cultivation, livestock management (enteric fermentation and manure 
management), nitrous oxide emissions from managed soils and fertilizer are the main contributors 
to emissions. Total emissions in the agriculture sector in the base year of 2016, amounted to 18 
MtCO e. Emissions are estimated to almost double to 35 MtCO e in 2050 assuming current trends 
2 2
continue and no major mitigation actions occur. The main drivers of the agriculture sector are 
population  and  economic  growth,  which  lead  to  increased  rice  and  meat  production  and 
consumption.  
The energy sector was responsible for roughly 8 MtCO e in 2016. It is the third largest emitting sector 
2
after FOLU and agriculture. Emissions are expected to grow exponentially, however, up to 83 MtCO e 
2
under the BAU scenario by 2050, driven by population and economic growth leading to increased 
 
Cambodia’s Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality    8 
  
energy  demand.  As  the  BAU  scenario  follows  a  conventional,  primarily  fossil  fuel-based  and 
emissions-intensive development path, emissions are expected to increase by a factor of 10. 
The FOLU sector was responsible for 51 MtCO e of emissions in 2016, the largest share of emissions 
2
in Cambodia. Deforestation is the major cause of emissions. Under the BAU scenario, emissions would 
decrease to 21 MtCO e by 2050, with an annual decline by 2.6 percent between 2016 and 2050. 
2
The waste sector is the second smallest emitter at 2.8 MtCO e in 2016. Under BAU conditions, 
2
emissions are expected to grow to up to 6.5 MtCO e by 2050, which includes emissions from solid 
2
waste disposal, biological treatment, burning, and wastewater.  
In the IPPU sector, the mineral industry (cement and glass), pulp and paper, lubricants, substitutes 
for ozone-depleting substances (refrigeration and air conditioning, and fire protection) as well as the 
food and beverage industry are the main contributors to emissions. Emissions totaled 1.8 MtCO e in 
2
2016,  mainly  from  the  cement  industry  (1.4  MtCO e,  74  percent)  and  refrigeration  and  air 
2
conditioning (0.4 MtCO e, 21 percent). According to BAU projections, emissions in 2050 is expected 
2
to  increase  to  11  MtCO e,  with  55  percent  from  the  cement  industry  and  39  percent  from 
2
refrigeration and air conditioning.  
2.1.2.  The LTS4CN scenario 
Reaching carbon neutrality requires both reducing sources of emissions, such as the combustion of 
fossil fuels, and increasing carbon sinks, such as by expanding forests, since trees capture carbon 
from the atmosphere as they grow. Cambodia’s vision for carbon neutrality is founded on the 
country’s  strong  political  commitment  in  the  FOLU  sector.  Under  the  LTS4CN  scenario,  full 
implementation of the REDD+ Investment Plan will drive afforestation and reforestation activities. 
The FOLU sector is expected to become a significant carbon sink in 2050, leaving room for other 
sectors to incrementally transition towards carbon neutrality.

Figure 6: GHG emissions projections in the BAU and LTS4CN scenarios 
The LTS4CN scenario suggests that Cambodia could achieve overall carbon neutrality in 2050 with 
the FOLU sector providing a total carbon sink of about 50 MtCO e. The waste and IPPU sectors will 
2
be the least emitting sectors in 2050 with 1.6 and 1.2 MtCO e, respectively. The energy sector is 
2
expected to be the highest emitter at 28 MtCO e, followed by agriculture at 19 MtCO e (Figure 6).

Compared to the BAU scenario, where carbon emissions are expected to increase to up to 156 MtCO e 
2
in 2050, the LTS4CN scenario would cumulatively avoid about 1,400 MtCO e of emissions over 30 
2
years (Figure 6). Reaching carbon neutrality is possible if the FOLU sector can develop a significant 
carbon sink and all other sectors gradually reduce their emissions to the levels suggested in Table 2. 
Total emissions in the LTS4CN scenario are projected to decline gradually until 2040, with the 
decrease slowing between 2040 and 2050, as summarized in Figure 7. Figure 13 summarizes major 
mitigation actions and targets for each sector.

Figure 7: GHG emissions projections in the LTS4CN scenario with sectoral shares 
The LTS4CN scenario introduces eight mitigation actions for the agriculture sector to avoid a total of 
16 MtCO e in 2050. That corresponds to an emissions reduction of 45 percent compared to the BAU 
2
scenario. Major decreases of emissions in crop cultivation can be achieved by using less methane-
intensive rice cultivars, direct seeding practices, alternate wetting and drying practices, and organic 
fertilizer and, deep fertilizer technology. In livestock management, mitigation measures are feed 
additives  for  cattle,  improved  fodder  management  and  the  wide  application  of  composting 
technology.

The FOLU sector consultation and modelling process suggested a “green highway” scenario where

2
(Figure 9). This can be achieved through implementing ambitious sector policies and strategies 
starting from the early 2020s, including the full implementation of the existing REDD+ Investment 
Plan until 2050. Five key sectoral mitigation actions under the LTS4CN scenario are reducing 
deforestation,  afforestation  and  reforestation,  improved  forest  management,  assisted  natural 
regeneration9 of native forests and riparian landscapes, and agroforestry.

Figure 9: GHG emissions projections for the FOLU sector in the LTS4CN scenario 
Cambodia’s LTS4CN scenario for the energy sector can lead to significant emissions reductions by 
progressively prioritizing three main actions: energy efficiency and conservation, shifts to low-
carbon sources and decarbonization of electricity production. The scenario projects the energy 
sector would emit only 28 MtCO e by 2050 (Figure 10), an emissions reduction of 66 percent 
2
compared to the BAU scenario. 
Major emissions saving comes from energy efficiency in buildings and industry, the switch to 
electricity for domestic cooking, and coal substitution and abatement in the industrial, and power 
sectors. Incremental decarbonization of the power sector is suggested through a moderate share of

renewable energy in the generation mix until 2050, while using natural gas as a transitional fuel. That 
requires substantial investment in combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plants and LNG import 
capacity. In the transportation sector, emissions savings can be achieved by developing rail for 
passengers and freight, urban public transportation, and the electrification of the passenger and, 
light-duty vehicle fleet.

The LTS4CN scenario suggests five mitigation actions for the IPPU sector that could avoid a total of 
9.1 MtCO e of emissions compared to 10.7 MtCO e under BAU. These priority actions aim to reduce 
2 2
emissions in cement production and use as well as the climate impact of refrigerants. They include 
promoting clinker substitution and carbon capture and storage in cement production as well as the 
recycling of aggregate concrete. The refrigeration and air-conditioning market would need to 
implement use of refrigerants with low global warming potential, accompanied by regular inspection 
of equipment and recovery of spent refrigerants (Figure 11).

recycle principles; producing biogas and compost from organic waste; eliminating open burning;

2.2.  Economic costs and benefits  
The sector analysis entailed consultations to identify 31 key actions contributing to carbon neutrality. 
Discussions of a long list of options led to the selection of five to eight key actions per sector that 
capture the main opportunities for achieving carbon neutrality. Some actions bundle sets of more 
detailed actions. An assessment of economic costs and benefits of the 31 key actions built on an 
Extended Cost Benefit Analysis (see more details in separate the Technical Annex).  
The LTS4CN scenario creates estimated net economic benefits for the public and private sectors of 
about $5 billion in 2050 (3 percent of projected GDP). Further benefits will include $1 billion in 
adaptation co-benefits from LTS4CN actions. Wider social and environmental benefits would reach 
$6 billion, mainly from FOLU actions. Full net benefits start from the first year of the LTS4CN and 
grow to more than $11 billion in 2050, which is 7.5 percent of projected GDP that year (see Section 
3 for more details). This would compensate for about two thirds of the GDP lost due to climate change 
impacts, as estimated in the Climate Economic Growth Impact Model (CEGIM) for Cambodia.

Total costs and benefits  1,859  5,366  11,188 
 
By 2050, the private sector would be investing nearly $1.4 billion each year, mainly in energy, 
transportation and forestry, with some significant investment in the IPPU. Private-sector operating 
expenditure benefits are six times initial investment costs and come from a wide range of actions. 
Benefits are high from energy efficiency ($3.4 billion), vehicle electrification ($1.1 billion) and rail 
and freight haulage ($1.1 billion). These are reduced by nearly $800 million, however, due to the 
opportunity costs of protecting forest from conversion to agriculture. Public capital expenditure is 
relatively small, with some ongoing investment in renewable energy, buses, trains, and forestry, in 
line with the REDD+ Investment Plan. There are significant ongoing public operating expenditures, 
dominated by rail and haulage ($500 million) and the loss of a fuel tax from the electrification of 
vehicles ($200 million). These costs are offset by operating profits from renewable energy, however. 
The net contribution of the agriculture, waste, and IPPU sectors is small.

2.2.1.  Public sector costs 
Public costs are dominated by operating expenditures in the energy and transportation sectors, 
including costs associated with rail and freight and loss of a fuel duty from electrification. While 
public transportation fares will gradually increase to reduce the subsidy required for bus operations, 
this will be more than offset by the steady rise in the loss of a fuel duty due to the electrification of 
cars. These costs could be reduced or even entirely avoided by introducing other forms of vehicle 
taxation and building demand for buses and trains so that pricing policies can make bus and rail 
operators profitable. 
There are smaller net costs in the forestry sector, mainly from lost forestry royalties, but also from 
the costs of supporting reforestation, afforestation, improved forestry management and restoration 
of degraded forest. Costs of public support average $17 million per year in the first 10 years of the 
LTS4CN scenario, consistent with the REDD+ Investment Plan, which requires $16 million per year. 
2.2.2.  Public financing plan 
The LTS4CN will require substantial public investment over 30 years (Table 5). A proposed public 
financing plan suggests devoting 1 percent of new public borrowing to the LTS4CN and making a 
small shift in public spending on economic services to divert 2 percent to LTS4CN actions. These two 
measures provide 40-50 percent of financing needs. The financing plan  assumes the gradual 
introduction of pricing policies and taxation reform in the transportation sector, which will cover 90 
percent of transportation sector costs by 2050. 
The remainder of public finance needs will be met by international climate finance. This will include 
major investment in public transportation and rail freight as well as support for the forestry sector 
and financing for carbon capture and storage and, grid flexibility.

2.3.  Technology and capacity needs 
Technology and capacity needs are crucial for successful LTS4CN implementation, especially for the 
Department of Climate Change, the Climate Change Technical Working Group, and sectoral and 
subnational technical working groups. They are the enablers of adaptation and mitigation actions 
and  commitments.  Without  proper  capacity  and  technology,  it  will  be  difficult  although  not 
impossible for Cambodia to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The following subsections summarize 
key technology and capacity needs for each sector. 
2.3.1.  Agriculture sector 
Major barriers to LTS4CN actions in agriculture include conflicting land use demands, the clash 
between  regional  and  sectoral  implementation  plans,  and  the  significant  energy  required  for 
manufacturing organic fertilizers. Transformations are required to improve agriculture productivity, 
increase land use efficiency and enhance planning and implementation, among others. Table 6 details 
the challenges and required technology and capacity.

2.3.2.  Energy sector 
The main barriers to the LTS4CN scenario in the energy sector include obstacles to electric cooking, 
large-scale displacement of coal in industries, challenges to increase clean transportation, develop 
collective transportation and a sustainable transportation economy, increase variable renewable 
energy, the use of natural gas in the power and transportation sectors, and develop “behind the meter” 
distributed energy resources. Table 7 suggests how to address these barriers to achieve necessary 
transformations.

2.3.3.  FOLU sector 
For the FOLU sector, gaps in the technical capacity for measurement, reporting and verification 
(MRV) were identified as emphasized in the 2020 Biennial Update Report and the Updated NDC. 
Capacity gaps relate to a lack of in-depth understanding of the technical aspects of GHGs and 
mitigation actions, including the detailed set of modalities, procedures and guidelines under the 
Enhanced Transparency Framework, GHG inventories, mitigation analysis, climate vulnerability and 
adaptation assessments, projection methods for emissions and removals, quality assurance and 
control, and technical support for improving activity data and emissions factors. Also important is 
improving institutional capacity for monitoring and evaluation to enhance reporting on mitigation, 
adaptation, and support needed and, received. Table 8 provides an overview.

2.3.4.  IPPU sector 
Several major barriers in the IPPU sector include the long-distance transportation of captured carbon, 
the use of several products for clinker substitution, the risk of increased emissions from recycling 
aggregate concrete, and the impact of refrigeration and air-conditioning systems on global warming. 
Needed transformations could build on technical and economic feasibility assessments to determine 
carbon capture readiness, the allocation of bare lands away from residential areas for carbon storage, 
the introduction of novel technologies and national-level research on using refrigerants with low 
global warming potential. Table 9 summarizes major challenges and outlines required technology 
and capacity.

2.3.5.  Waste sector 
Several main barriers to the LTS4CN in the waste sector include gaps in solid data; the lack of clear 
government investment policies, incentives and mechanisms; insufficient institutional capacity; and 
limited public participation and awareness. Necessary transformations, among others, centre on 
installing  weighbridges  and  matters,  developing  a  central  database  and  conducting  waste

3. Socioeconomic Benefits 
3.1.  Costs and benefits of LTS4CN actions 
Figure  presents the evolution of net costs and benefits for each of the 31 actions in the LTS4CN. Ten 
actions account for over 90 percent of total costs and benefits, covering both public and private costs. 
Actions with the highest net benefits are at the bottom of the figure; actions with the highest net costs 
are at the top. 
Major costs are from lost timber and farming revenues arising from reduced deforestation, along 
with expenditures on carbon capture and storage and to some extent for public transportation over 
the first decade. Forest restoration also requires net costs in the same period.  
Four actions would deliver substantial net benefits. Public transportation benefits arise from reduced 
vehicle operation costs, and time savings among commuters on all modes of transportation due to 
lower congestion. Renewable energy is profitable through most of the time. Road and rail haulage 
and switching to low global warming potential refrigerants are also profitable.  
The private sector would see very strong benefits from energy efficiency. Afforestation yields steadily 
growing benefits. The electrification of vehicles in the last decade of the period delivers nearly 
$500 million of benefits by 2050. 
 
 
 
Cambodia’s Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality    26 
  
 
Figure 14: Costs and benefits of key LTS4CN actions, including public and private capital and operating expenditures  
A marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve describes both the cost effectiveness of the action (on the   
y-axis) and the scale of its potential contribution to emission reductions (on the x-axis). This Figure  
presents a MAC curve for the LTS4CN, with the average cost effectiveness over the period on the          
y-axis and the potential reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 on the x-axis. Labels for smaller actions 
are removed to make the MAC curve more legible. The more cost-effective actions appear to the left 
of the curve. 
 
 
Cambodia’s Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality    27 
  
 
Figure 15: The MAC curve for 2050 
28 
  
The MAC curve provides a guide to help prioritize actions. It offers only a broad overview, 
however, and simplifies key issues, including changes in cost effectiveness due to technical 
innovation and market conditions, and greater expense as actions are scaled up. Despite these 
shortcomings, some conclusions are possible. 
•  About 15 percent of emissions reductions comes from six actions that are strongly 
profitable: energy efficiency, rail, refrigerants, renewable energy, electric vehicles, 
and public transportation; 
•  About 50 percent of reductions can be achieved by actions that are marginally 
profitable, including, in particular, afforestation, forest management, and rice 
practices; and 
•  The remaining 35 percent of reductions require actions with net costs. These 
reductions are dominated by reduced deforestation and carbon storage and capture. 
3.2.  Total economic costs and benefits 
The economic analysis suggests that the LTS4CN create net economic benefits for the public 
and private sector even before accounting for adaptation and wider social and environmental 
benefits. These net benefits start from the first year of the LTS4CN and grow to more than $4 
billion in 2050, over 2.8 percent of projected GDP that year. 
Public and private sectors: Figure  shows that public sector costs start at relatively modest 
levels and grow steadily through the period, reaching nearly $1 billion or 0.7 percent of GDP in 
2050. The private sector experiences strong net benefits from the second year, reaching $1 
billion in 2036 and growing strongly for the remainder of the period. The figure also shows, 
however, that these net benefits require significant private sector investment, which must 
grow steadily to nearly $1.5 billion in 2050. This investment is profitable but requires clear 
policy commitments to providing private sector confidence in investing in carbon neutral actions. 
29 
  
Figure 16: Total costs and benefits of public and private capital and operating expenditures  
Costs and benefits by sector: Figure 14 shows the sectoral distribution of net costs and 
benefits. The economic impacts of actions in the agriculture, waste, and IPPU sectors are small. 
The overall costs are dominated by FOLU, with net costs in 2050 of about $1 billion. These costs 
are attributed to the FOLU sector but the largest element is the opportunity cost of foregoing 
income from the agricultural use of deforested land. The cost of foregoing timber sales from 
deforestation is also large. Direct forestry costs are significant but smaller than the opportunity 
costs associated with reduced deforestation. The benefits are dominated by energy and 
transportation, with net benefits of over $4 billion in 2050, driven largely by economic savings 
from energy efficiency plus reduced commuting costs associated with public transportation, 
renewable energy, lower haulage costs, and electric vehicles. 
 
Cambodia’s Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality     30 
  
Figure 14: Total costs and benefits by sector 
3.3.  Public sector costs 
Figure 15 shows public sector costs by sector, with substantial funding required in energy and 
transportation, FOLU, and IPPU.  Mid-period funding in the energy sector relates largely to 
public transportation. The strong increase in the last decade is associated with investment in 
rail and haulage to support strong economic growth, and the loss of a fuel duty as electrification 
of transportation expands. 
 
Figure 15: Public sector costs by sector 
 
 
Cambodia’s Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality     31 
  
Figure 19 shows the breakdown of public expenditure requirements by key actions. The largest 
requirements are for operating expenditures in the energy and transportation sectors, which 
require over $350 million in funding in 2050, with large funding requirements for rail and 
haulage. The loss of a fuel tax is partially offset by gains from competitive renewable energy 
generation. Public transportation subsidies are initially high but the analysis assumes that 
these costs are increasingly offset through cost-recovery fare policies. Carbon capture and 
storage requires steadily increasing funding; no accounting is made for possible reductions in 
its costs. 
 
Figure 19: Public sector costs by action 
There are smaller net costs in the forestry sector, mainly from lost forestry royalties but also 
from the cost of supporting reforestation, afforestation, improved forestry management, and 
restoration of degraded forest. The costs of public support average $17 million per year in the 
first 10 years of the LTS4CN. This is consistent with the REDD+ Investment Plan, which 
requires $16 million per year.

3.4.  Implications for investment, economic growth, gender, 
and jobs 
This section considers only the net economic benefits from LTS4CN actions, without taking into 
account the adaptation and wider social and environmental benefits, which are addressed in 
the next section. 
Figure    presents  the  potential  loss  in  GDP  arising  from  climate  change  with  no  global 
commitment to carbon neutrality. This assessment comes from the CEGIM. It suggests that GDP 
in 2050 would be lower by over $15 billion or 10 percent of GDP if mitigation is limited to the 
levels assumed in the IPCC mid-range climate change scenarios.10 If global commitments to 
carbon neutrality are realized, this will not eliminate all GDP losses; the extent of loss 
avoidance is unclear, however. Some losses arise because of emissions that have already taken 
place. Achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 would reduce cumulative new emissions by half (if 
reductions are achieved in a linear fashion), compared to a mitigation policy freezing emissions 
at current levels. If GDP losses from past emissions account for one third of the total loss, and 
global carbon neutrality halved remaining losses, GDP loss would fall by about $5 billion in 
2050. 
 
Figure 20: Implications of LTS4CN for economic growth 
The assessment above considers only the effects of mitigation actions on reducing GDP loss 
arising from climate change. Economic analysis shows substantial net economic benefits from 
LTS4CN actions. It assumes that total annual public and private investment in these actions 
rises to $18.6 billion by 2050 and accounts for between 5-8 percent of total national investment 
                                                             
10 For floods, droughts, rainfall variability and sea level rise, it used the A1 scenarios in the IPCC Special Report on 
Extreme Events, and for heat stress, the RCP4.5 scenarios in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. 
 
Cambodia’s Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality     33 
  
over the period. The analysis suggests that net annual benefits from this investment would rise 
to over $6 billion by 2050, which implies an average rate of return on investment of 20-25 
percent. In recent years, Cambodia has achieved high growth rates of over 7 percent of GDP 
with investment levels of about 25 percent of GDP, suggesting that routine non-LTS4CN 
investment be delivering rates of return on investment similar to those achieved by the 
LTS4CN  investment.  Although  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  around  the  accuracy  of 
available data, evidence suggests it would be possible to reallocate some domestic investment 
from  routine  development  to  LTS4CN  actions  without  a significant  loss  of  growth.  The 
substantial  economic  gains  from  mitigation  are  thus  achievable  without  significant  net 
economic costs. 
Based on available evidence, the average return on investment for routine development is 
about  five  percentage  points  higher  than  for  LTS4CN  investment,  at  about  28  percent 
compared to 20-25 percent. There would, therefore, be a modest reduction in growth from 
diverting  funds  from  routine  development  to  LTS4CN  investment,  before  considering 
mitigation, adaptation, and wider benefits. Achieving the financing plan presented in the 
previous  section  would  mean  26  percent  of  LTS4CN  investment  would  be  funded  by 
international climate finance, without reducing domestic investment in routine development. 
This would roughly compensate for the difference in returns on investment. The scale of 
international funding envisaged in the financing plan is consistent with the argument that 
developing countries should be compensated for the net costs of their contribution to global 
mitigation. 
The CEGIM analysis suggests that a package of adaptation measures could reduce losses and 
damages arising from climate change by 22 percent or about $3.3 billion.11 If global carbon 
neutrality plans are implemented (worth about $5 billion to Cambodia in 2050) and Cambodia 
adopts the adaptation measures described in the CEGIM analysis (worth about $3.3 billion), 
the potential loss of GDP arising from climate change could be about 55 percent less than the 
$15 billion projected in the CEGIM analysis,12 without significantly reducing growth from 
investment in the economy. 
Figure  presents an estimate of the potential value of carbon emissions delivered by LTS4CN 
actions, if they are valued at the social cost of carbon of $100 per tCO e.13 This analysis suggests 
2
larger reductions in the loss of GDP may be achievable, although given uncertainties around 
the appropriate value of the social cost of carbon, this comparison is useful mainly as a source 
of confidence that the LTS4CN economic analysis is not exaggerated. 
Labour and jobs: The economic benefits from LTS4CN actions could take the form of either 
increased profits or increased income associated with new jobs and greater wages. Since the 
case studies reviewed in the economic analysis do not provide enough evidence to assess 
whether benefits come from profits or income, a detailed modelling of the impact on jobs and 
incomes is not possible. A first indication can be provided by using evidence in the Cambodia 
Social Accounting Matrix (SAM), which distinguishes between returns to income and capital 
for 26 sectors, including agriculture and forestry (56 percent to labour), manufacturing (60 
                                                             
11 These adaptation measures are mostly different than the LTS4CN actions. The benefits are thus separate from 
the adaptation co-benefits from LTS4CN actions. 
12 The net economic benefits from the LTS4CN. 
13 The social cost of carbon is estimated by dividing the expected global loss of GDP arising from climate change by 
the emissions reductions required to avoid that loss. The Biden Administration in the United States of America is 
currently reviewing evidence on the social cost of carbon but it is expected to rise substantially from the level of 
$50 per tCO2e used in the Obama Administration to a level greater than $100 per tCO2e. 
 
Cambodia’s Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality     34 
  
percent to labour), and transportation/services (51 percent to labour), with a national average 
of 45 percent to labour. Statistics from the International Labour Organization (ILO) show 
average salaries in 21 sectors in 2019, with a national average of $266 per month and $173 per 
month for agriculture and forestry, $254 for manufacturing, $259 for energy, and $170 for 
water and sanitation. 
Using these statistics, it is possible to estimate the number of jobs created by the economic 
benefits of each LTS4CN sector. The analysis does not count jobs created by actions that have 
net costs because the costs will be reflected in lower incomes elsewhere in the economy. For 
example, all FOLU actions do create jobs in forestry but some also involve substantial net costs. 
In particular, reducing deforestation generates some jobs, such as in enforcement, but it results 
in the loss of agricultural income from the inability to cultivate land that would otherwise have 
been converted into agriculture. 
The analysis suggests that the direct economic benefits from LTS4CN actions would deliver 
157,000 jobs by 2050, using the following assumptions: 
•  Only the LTS4CN actions that deliver net benefits are considered; 
•  The share of benefits obtained by labour is based on the SAM; and 
•  All sector salaries rise in line with the CEGIM projections for per capita GDP. 
All of these jobs are in sectors with average incomes that are less than the national average, 
generating a net contribution to reducing equality. About 80 percent of the jobs are in the 
energy and transportation sector. Since it has wages only slightly below the national average, 
the net impact on inequality would be modest. 
If resources for LTS4CN investment were used for routine development, outside the LTS4CN, 
and if they achieved returns similar to the average for Cambodia in recent years, total economic 
benefits would be slightly higher than direct benefits from LTS4CN actions. As a higher share 
of benefits would go to profits and average wages would be higher, the total number of jobs 
created would be slightly higher at about 183,000 in 2050, compared to 157,000 for LTS4CN 
investment. 
 
Table below expands the analysis to include not only jobs created by the direct economic 
benefits from LTS4CN actions. When jobs from wider mitigation and adaptation benefits are 
added, LTS4CN actions generate 449,000 jobs in 2050, or 145% more than routine investment.

Impact on gender equality: The impact of the LTS4CN on gender equality is difficult to assess 
without more detailed evidence on incomes in subsectors and the possibilities for designing 
actions to promote gender equality.  An illustration of the potential impact, however, is 
provided by comparing the impact of reduced deforestation (the only action with net annual 
private sector costs) with the impact of energy efficiency (which delivers just over half of total 
annual private sector benefits). The costs from reduced deforestation involve loss of farm 
income, where women will be more affected than men because they account for 53 percent of 
agricultural labour. In contrast, benefits from energy efficiency in manufacturing are over twice 
the costs of deforestation, and women account for 67.5 percent of manufacturing labour. New 
jobs for women in manufacturing will be much better paid than those lost in agriculture. Table 
2 presents the analysis and shows that the combined effect of the two LTS4CN actions will 
increase incomes by over $600 million in 2050 and create over 22,000 new jobs. Women will 
receive 77 percent of the net increase in income and 86 percent of the net increase in jobs.

The above analysis considers only the impacts on incomes and jobs from the direct economic 
costs and benefits of the two LTS4CN actions. There are three further ways in which the 
LTS4CN will affect gender equality. 
•  Actions have adaptation co-benefits. Since women are more vulnerable to climate 
change than men, they are likely to benefit more from adaptation; 
•  Actions have wider social and environmental benefits, mainly related to forestry (i.e., 
better health, non-timber incomes, and flood reduction). These will be shared by both 
men and women but will benefit women more because they are more engaged in 
activities linked to natural resources; and 
•  Finally, if the LTS4CN is matched by equivalent global reductions in emissions, there 
will be very large benefits from reduced economic losses and damages due to slower 
climate  change.  Women  again  will  benefit  more  than  men  given  their  greater 
vulnerability to climate change. 
3.5.  Adaptation and wider social and environmental 
benefits 
Adaptation benefits: A monetary value for adaptation benefits was estimated based on a 
classification system developed. It is assumed that a high classification will increase benefits 
 
Cambodia’s Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality     36 
  
by 50 percent. This is because most adaptation benefits are associated with resilience to 
extreme and irregular rainfall patterns. The IPCC Special Report on Extreme Events suggests 
that the frequency of these events would roughly double by 2050 in Cambodia.14 Therefore, 
the average increase over the period in benefits from a public action with high adaptation 
relevance is 50 percent, compared to 30 percent for a mid-level of relevance and 10 percent 
for low relevance. 
Wider  social  and  environmental  benefits:  Wider  benefits  are  estimated  based  on  a 
comprehensive literature review of case studies reporting on the valuation of social and 
environmental benefits. This review is summarized in the separate technical Annex. The 
evidence is patchy. While several studies attempt valuation, they often produce quite widely 
varying results.  
Total wider social and environmental benefits are estimated to be worth more than the 
economic benefits, at nearly $7 billion in 2050. Over 90 percent of these benefits are associated 
with forestry and almost all the rest with energy efficiency. Key features of the wider benefits 
are as follows. 
•  Forestry delivers critical watershed benefits related to the retention of water in the soil. 
This reduces erosion, which decreases dam siltation and improves water quality. It also 
reduces downstream flooding. For established natural forests, these benefits  are 
estimated at over $500 per hectare a year. Plantations and recovering forest areas also 
deliver watershed benefits but to a lesser degree. 
•  Forestry delivers important biodiversity benefits with studies suggesting that one-off 
loss of these benefits from deforestation amount to about $2,000 per hectare. 
•  The economic analysis includes only potential incomes from timber extraction. Wider 
benefits from tourism and non-timber forest products are also possible, with values of 
over $300 per hectare reported in various studies. 
•  The main wider benefits from energy and transportation relate to the health benefits 
from  reduced  pollution.  Global  studies  provide  some  indications  of  the  average 
national cost of pollution linked to emissions. When these are adjusted to reflect 
Cambodia’s per capita income, they suggest an average of $4.6 per tCO e. Economic 
2
analysis uses this figure for power generation. Emissions from transportation are likely 
to have significantly higher health costs because people are much more exposed to 
concentrated levels of pollution. 
•  The Extended Cost Benefit Analysis case studies and international literature review 
provide  some  evidence  for  further  specific  wider  benefits.  Health  benefits  from 
electrification of cooking are about 10 times higher than average health benefits. Buses 
and trains cut the number of accidents. Waste actions reduce water pollution.

now  and  in  the  medium-term  2050  scenario  was  included.  Some  impacts  that  are  not 
immediately relevant can become very significant with the progression of climate change.  
It was assumed that extreme events become more frequent in line with the conclusions of the 
IPCC 2012 Special Report on Extreme Events. The report found that the frequency of most 
irregular climatic events (from floods to droughts to unseasonal rainfall) will roughly double 
by 2050. Exposure to climate change will be mainly through the changing frequency of extreme 
events and rainfall variability.  
The results of the analysis are reported in the following tables by sector. A scale shows the 
expected impact of each measure (low, moderate, medium, high, and top). The last column 
indicates specific NDC actions related to proposed adaptation benefits.

4.2.  MRV indicators and tracking 
4.2.1.  MRV framework 
MRV helps transparently demonstrate progress in implementing the LTS4CN in line with the 
targets of Cambodia’s Updated NDC. 
Cambodia has developed an integrated and detailed MRV system for her updated NDC that 
comprises tracking and reporting on progress towards adaptation and mitigation, finance 
received, and required capacity support. The system assists in the coordination of NDC 
implementation, provides a collective and easy way to update progress made, serves as an 
effective communication and engagement tool, and provides access to all information relevant 
to reporting under the Paris Agreement. In developing the system, particular attention was 
paid to integrating cross-cutting issues in the tracking, such as those related to youth, gender, 
and private sector engagement.   
The  MRV  framework  for  the  LTS4CN  will  build  on  existing  government  systems,  while 
strengthening capacity and data collection capability where possible. It will be integrated into 
the online NDC tracking system with reporting conducted in parallel. The long-term process 
will be tracked with specific sectoral headline indicators (Table 19) and results indicators that 
will be selected later.

4.2.2.  Reporting responsibility   
The LTS4CN will likely be reviewed every five years in line with the framework for updating 
NDCs. This will ensure the transparency, accuracy, and comparability of information on 
emissions reductions leading towards carbon neutrality by 2050.  
Relevant sector leads and ministries will contribute to tracking LTS4CN implementation. They 
will need to communicate outcomes to the National Council for Sustainable Development to 
support  national  reporting.  The  Council  is  responsible  for  collecting  and  submitting 
Cambodia’s national reporting related to the Paris Agreement.
