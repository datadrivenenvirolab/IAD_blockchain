Climate change caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is transforming our environment at a speed unprecedented in human history. Failing to thwart this development economic and food systems on prosperity in the broad sense. Acting now and decisively for the climate is therefore essential. This is both an urgent challenge and an opportunity to build a better future for all. On this backdrop global climate action. The accomplishment of the main objective of this agreement requires reaching climate neutrality (zero net GHG emissions) by the middle of the 21st century requires a rapid and profound transformation of the economy and society. that's why December 2019 for sustainable and inclusive growth aimed at transforming the European Union (EU) into a fair and prosperous resources growth in resource use. The implementation of the green pact is in progress. Thereby European on the climate3 net reduction of GHG emissions in the EU of at least 55% by 2030) June 30, 2021. Anticipating development at European level climate neutrality in Luxembourg by 2050 at the latest entered into force in December 2020. Since then strategy and identifies the guidelines as well as the main fields of action and measures strategies for a successful transition to climate neutrality. It will serve as a guide for national climate policy for 2050 as agreed in the 2018-20235 coalition agreement. Besides European and international. In effect energy and climate action6 requires the establishment long-term climate action parties to the Paris Agreement are required to present long-term development strategies with low GHG emissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (CCNUCC). Given the cross-cutting nature of climate action essential between the various ministerial departments competent in the sectors concerned. 1 See in particular the special report of the IPCC (2018) on the consequences of global warming of 1 relative to pre-industrial levels and associated trajectories of global greenhouse gas emissions in the context of strengthening the global response to climate change and the fight against poverty 2 Communication from the European Commission (COM(2019) 640 final): The European Green Deal 3 Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of 30 June 2021 establishing the framework required to achieve climate neutrality and amending Regulations (EC) No 401/2009 and (EU) 2018/1999 (“European Climate Law”) lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R1119&from=FR 4 Amended law of 15 December 2020 relating to the climate 5 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 6 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02018R1999-20210101&from=EN Towards climate neutrality in 2050 4 / 97 Thus the aim of ensuring the coherence of sectoral policies with the objective of climate neutrality ministries have provided their contributions relating to the guidelines and main fields of action and policy measures in their respective areas. Following the finalization of the draft of the pre- long-term strategy project government council Next General public. It was made accessible on the national portal of public inquiries and on the portal from the Ministry of the Environment invited to submit their comments and suggestions by October 12, 2021. The final draft of the strategy was adopted by the Council of Government on October 29, 2021. The strategy covering an extended period of thirty years regular. It should be noted that the aforementioned Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 provides every five years day will make it possible to complete and refine the strategy and innovations in this area as well as the conclusions resulting from the dialogue that is established within the framework climate policy governance Achieving climate neutrality implies a profound transformation of the economy and the society. This process involves considerable challenges unique in socio-economic and environmental terms: job creation competitiveness quality of life structural and economic. The transition will therefore have to be socially just and economically efficient and aspire to maximum valuation of the co-benefits public finances. It is only with the participation of all that it will be possible to succeed in such a social project. The The success of the transition essentially depends on the acceptance it will meet with from the population. It is therefore necessary to work on an attractive perspective for all by following a integrated approach and establish the basis of trust within our company and among all stakeholders economic that this change is necessary the opportunity to actively design change Guiding principles to guide the transition to climate neutrality in Luxembourg: 1. Exploit the potential for reducing anthropogenic GHG emissions so as not to have to offset by absorptions that the residual emissions 2. Socially just transition: leaving no one behind; 3. Economically efficient and financially viable transition: preserve or even improve Luxembourg's competitiveness sustainably healthy and balanced; 4. Involve society and economic actors in the design of the transition; 5. Integrated approach: promoting an approach that respects development objectives sustainability of the 2030 Agenda 6. Clear legislative and policy framework coherence of the Luxembourg legislative and policy framework (including strategies instruments and investments) with the objective of climate neutrality; 7. Facilitating EU framework: work for and take advantage of a favorable EU framework that is essential for a successful transition from a small open economy to neutrality climate; Towards climate neutrality by 2050 5 / 97 8. Regional cooperation and with other Member States: cooperating in the Greater Region and with the other Member States to improve the efficiency and speed of the transition; 9. Green finance: exploiting the strengths of the Luxembourg financial center ecosystem to successfully finance the green transition nationally and globally; 10. Post-COVID-19 green recovery: take advantage of post-COVID-19 economic recovery programs COVID-19 to accelerate the transition; 11. Integrated reduction of environmental harm: do not act to the detriment of health human the environment and make the most of the co-benefits human; 12. Waiver of the promotion of nuclear energy; 13. Improving resilience: do no harm to resilience of the natural environment to climate change. Successfully transitioning to climate neutrality in Luxembourg by 2050 at the latest requires a action taken directors guiding the transition (Between brackets is a selection of the levers and instruments described in the strategy.):  effective governance and the active participation of all actors in the transition (law relating to the climate  provide the necessary incentives through fiscal policy (the polluter-principle) payer 2  integrate climate aspects into the State budget and guarantee public finances sustainable (investments in key infrastructure evolution profile towards low GHG emission development);  consolidate the pioneering role of the State and municipalities by developing public procurement sustainable (sustainable public buildings decarbonization by 2040);  exploit the intersectoral coordinating function of territorial and urban planning (master program for regional development of attraction and concentrated deconcentration  mobilize research and promote innovation and digitization (national strategy for research and innovation  Foster societal engagement and expand the key role of education and training (participation of citizens and consumers skills development); as well as  consolidate the EU framework for climate action (legislative package “Delivering the European  Green  Deal » eco-design). In short the 2050 horizon must be ensured. Next strategies to guide transformation in all relevant sectors (In parentheses is evoked a selection of the levers and instruments described in the strategy.): Towards climate neutrality in 2050 6 / 97 1.

Regarding funding priorities for climate action financial instruments compatible with the objective of climate neutrality unrecoverable. Investments in the green modernization of the Luxembourg economy will be essential to maintaining or even improving the country's long-term competitiveness and will require planning in line with the budgetary trajectory and the requirements of the stability and growth balanced. In this sense Duchy of Luxembourg7 COVID-19 pandemic to accelerate the green and sustainable transformation of the economy. 7 https://gouvernement.lu/fr/dossiers.gouv_mfin%2Bfr%2Bdossiers%2B2021%2Bplanderelance.html Towards climate neutrality in 2050 8 / 97 2 Context The findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are unequivocal. Climate change caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) is transforming our environment at a speed unprecedented in history of humanity. Failing to thwart this development implications for economic and food systems political stability sustainable development agreed globally within the framework of the United Nations. Acting now and decisively for the climate is therefore essential. It is both a challenge urgency and an opportunity to build a better future for all. 2.1 International and European context The Paris Agreement global level. At the heart of this agreement is the objective of containing the rise in temperature global average well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels continue efforts to limit it to 1 risks and impacts of climate change. The Paris Agreement therefore calls for strong and fast globally. In effect illustrates the size of the challenge and the urgency to act: only a halving of emissions by 2030 global net anthropogenic emissions of CO compared to 2010 2 net emissions of CO ) on a planetary scale around 2050 and a strong reduction in all other GHGs 2 later in the 21st century overshoot or with minimal overshoot. Achieving this goal is still possible requires rapid and profound transformations in all areas removals by carbon sinks to offset residual emissions. Limiting the increase in the global average temperature to 1 irreversible impacts of climate change and reduce the costs associated with the adaptation of our society and economy to these impacts. The difference between an increase of 1 significant in terms of impacts and consequences for ecosystems and the economy. Ultimately the later we act enhancement of absorption by carbon sinks will have to be significant and rapid in the period after 2030. All parties to the Paris Agreement are required to present long-term strategies for low GHG emissions development to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The European Union (EU) submitted its long-term strategy in March 2020 on the basis of the conclusions of the European Council of 12 December 2019 which approved the objective of climate neutrality of the EU until 2050. The approval of this objective was obtained following an institutional and societal debate based on the strategic European vision for 8 IPCC at pre-industrial levels and associated trajectories of global greenhouse gas emissions context of the strengthening of the global response to climate change the fight against poverty Towards climate neutrality in 2050 9 / 97 long term “A clean planet for all”9 proposed by the European Commission in November 2018. This strategy presents a vision of the economic and societal transformations necessary to reach net zero GHG emissions by 2050 following a transition that is socially just and economically viable. It includes the related strategic priorities outlines a European facilitating framework for a successful transition and highlights the opportunities what this transition offers for the European economy and citizens to be met in order to carry it out. In December 2019 strategy for sustainable and inclusive growth aimed at transforming the EU into a fair society and prosperous characterized by the absence of net GHG emissions by 2050 and the decoupling of growth from resource usage. The green pact tends to guide and accelerate the inevitable transition in converting climate and environmental challenges into opportunities to be seized by all stakeholders in the society and the economy. It contains priority policies and measures and a roadmap with key actions covering the following aspects: strengthening the EU's climate ambition for 2030 and 2050; a clean energy supply promoting a circular and clean economy; energy-efficient construction and renovation resources; accelerate the transition to sustainable and smart mobility; design a system fair food biodiversity; a “zero pollution” ambition for a substance-free environment toxic; promote green finance and investment and ensure a just transition; green them national budgets and send the right price signals; mobilize research and promote innovation; activate education and training. The implementation of the green pact is in progress. Thereby european climate neutrality (European climate law) making it possible to anchor in law the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 to achieve the EU's 2030 net GHG emissions reduction target at least 55% below 1990 levels December 2020 in particular adopted the following conclusions:  “To achieve the EU climate neutrality target by 2050 the objectives of the Paris Agreement come and update its climate and energy action framework. For this purpose European Union approves a binding target consisting of a net reduction in emissions greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. 9 Communication from the European Commission (COM(2018) 773 final): A clean planet for all – One long-term strategic european vision for a prosperous economy the climate 10 Communication from the European Commission (COM(2019) 640 final): The European Green Deal 11 Communication from the European Commission (COM(2020) 562 final): Stepping up Europe’s 2030 climate ambition – Investing in a climate-neutral future for the benefit of our people (Plan cible en matière de climat à horizon 2030) Towards climate neutrality by 2050 10 / 97 He invites the co-legislators to take this new objective into account in the bill European Union on the climate and to adopt it quickly.  [The EU will raise its] climate ambitions in a way that will boost growth sustainable economic health and the environment and will contribute to the long-term global competitiveness of the EU economy by promoting innovation in green technologies. » Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 establishing the framework required to achieve climate neutrality and amending Regulations (EC) No 401/2009 and (EU) 2018/1999 (“European Climate Law”)12 endorsing the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 and a net reduction in carbon emissions greenhouse gases in the EU by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels dated June 30, 2021. To take into account the increased climate ambition presented on 14 July 2021 a legislative package13 environmental in particular proposals concerning the sharing of the effort between the Member States greenhouse gas emissions trading system (ETS) land renewable energies CO emissions for vehicles. 2 2.2 National context In the light of the special report on the consequences of global warming of 1 published in October 2018 of the 2018-2023 coalition agreement signed on December 3, 2018 this [Paris] Agreement and take into account the conclusions of the special report 1 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)”. Besides “to achieve this objective [objective of containing global warming below 2°C by compared to pre-industrial levels balance between emissions and removals (art. 4 of the Paris Agreement) committed to working towards the objective of net zero GHG emissions by 2050”15 and that “in order to to achieve this goal Pursuant to the coalition agreement and following the example of the regulation (EU) establishing the framework required for achieving climate neutrality (EU climate law) the long-term goal of climate neutrality net” in Luxembourg residual anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission is counterbalanced by removals anthropogenic equivalents”. 12 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R1119&from=FR 13 https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/delivering-european-green- deal_en 14 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 15 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 16 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 17 Amended Law of 15 December 2020 relating to the climate Towards climate neutrality by 2050 11 / 97 This long-term strategy identifies the guidelines and the main fields of action and strategic measures for a successful transition to climate neutrality. It will serve as a guide climate policy for 2050 as agreed in the aforementioned coalition agreement18. The objective of climate neutrality in 2050 implies a trajectory of reduction of emissions of appropriate GHG. Thereby Luxembourg's energy and climate policy for the period 2021-2030 (PNEC)19 and the law relating to the climate set as an intermediate objective in 2030 a reduction of 55% compared to the levels 2005 of emissions allocated to Luxembourg under Regulation (EU) 2018/84220. The PNEC 2018/199921 and the climate law Luxembourg by 2030. This is the main planning and monitoring instrument in this area. and addresses the following five dimensions: decarbonization renewable interior energy as well as research In addition to the aforementioned objective of reducing non-ETS GHG emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to to the year 2005 44% in terms of final energy compared to the European reference scenario of 2007 and to increase the share of renewable energies to 25% of gross final energy consumption at the 2030 horizon. It describes the policies and measures to achieve these objectives and constitutes during a roadmap that is implemented through the adoption of laws and regulations and projects as well as other measures between 2020 and 2030. It is now a question of further accelerating a transition initiated in recent years. In this context Third Industrial Revolution for the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg”22. Made according to a participatory approach and in collaboration with the American expert Jeremy Rifkin and his team result of the process is presented in the form of a detailed study proposing a panoply of strategic measures economy to begin the process of the "Third Industrial Revolution". In total people from all socio-economic sectors have been actively involved in participating in working groups based on energy challenges construction than prosumers and the social model. Prior to the development of the NECP and this long-term strategy were organized by the Department of the Environment of the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Infrastructures in 2018 with civil society actors science and public administration. These consultations were accompanied by the expert German Reinhard Loske. During a first co-creation workshop 18 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 19 Luxembourg's integrated national energy and climate plan for the period 2021-2030 https://environnement.public.lu/fr/actualites/2020/05/pnec.html 20 Regulation (EU) 2018/842 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments taken within the framework of the Paris Agreement and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 21 Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the governance of the energy union and climate action 22 https://www.troisiemerevolutionindustrielle.lu/etude-strategique/ Towards Climate Neutrality by 2050 12 / 97 identified social innovations to mitigate climate change. A second above all, the workshop made it possible to develop the fundamental principles of policy governance national climate. In June 2018 stakeholders. In June 2020 Regional Planning launched the urban-architectural and landscape consultation “Luxembourg in Transition – Territorial visions for the decarbonized and resilient future of the region Luxembourg function”23. It is part of the ongoing overhaul of the program regional development director (PDAT) concerning land use planning relating to the overhaul of the PDAT carried out between 2017 and 2018 and published under the title “Change collaborative territory". Ultimately sustainable development and climate policy which have tremendous potential to be mutually reinforcing. In effect of society and systems that contribute to limiting global warming to 1 perspective the United Nations 2030 Agenda with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)25 some priority action areas that directly support climate action  Promoting sustainable consumption and production  Plan and coordinate the use of the territory  Ensuring sustainable mobility  Protect the climate  Ensure sustainable finances Vice versa useful actions to advance the transition to climate neutrality set out in this long-term strategy achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in general and in particular SDG 13 – Measures relating to the fight against climate change or even SDG 7 – Clean energy and a affordable cost. 23 See also the chapter “Exploiting the coordinating function of territorial and urban planning” 24 Ministry of the Environment National for Sustainable Development https://environnement.public.lu/content/dam/environnement/documents/developpement- durable/PNDD.pdf 25 https://environnement.public.lu/fr/developpement-durable.html Towards climate neutrality in 2050 13 / 97 The COVID-19 pandemic places the whole world health challenges public been considerable. Gold green to which the Government has fully subscribed. In this sense and growth 202126 specifies that “[The Government] will continue in 2021 its budgetary policy fully in favor of qualitative and job-creating growth fostering innovation and social inclusion as well as giving the highest priority to investments to meet the challenges arising from the double ecological transition and digital. ". Clearly, climate action must be a cornerstone of the recovery making it possible to deal with the threat of climate change, the effects of which are much heavier to overcome and in the longer term too. A green recovery offers the opportunity to accelerate the transition coveted towards an economy with net zero GHG emissions. In this regard of its meeting of December 10 and 11, 2020 noted in particular that “the economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic offers the opportunity to accelerate the sustainable transformation and modernization of our economies and gain a competitive advantage”. And even that "it is necessary to make the best taken advantage of the MFF [multiannual financial framework]/Next Generation EU package just transition mechanism why Luxembourg has notably drawn up a “Recovery and Resilience Plan”27 (PRR) whose 61% of investments are dedicated to contributing to efforts in the fight against change climatic the Luxembourg PRR among the most ambitious in this area. 26 Ministry of Finance >  2025 gramegna/Stability-and-growth-programme.pdf 27 https://gouvernement.lu/fr/dossiers.gouv_mfin%2Bfr%2Bdossiers%2B2021%2Bplanderelance.html Towards climate neutrality in 2050 14 / 97 3 Summary of the national situation During the last three decades the transformation of its economy in the direction of progressive decarbonization.

Given the exceptional nature of the year 2020 refer to the year 2019. Around 57% in 201938 70% can be attributed to the sale of fuels to non-residents professionals. The causes are above all the geographical situation of Luxembourg at the crossroads Western Europe transit routes compared to neighboring countries and the high proportion of cross-border workers. After a higher drop 20% of emissions resulting from fuel sales between 2005 and 2016 the increase is recorded between 2017 and 2019. It should be noted that the quantity of fuels sold and not intended for export is growing steadily despite a lower total quantity in 2019 compared to 2005.

As Luxembourg does not have large power plants mainly electricity imports40 national balance sheet. Thereby 2019 thermal power station. Thanks to the development of renewable energy sources (essentially wind and solar energy) and the systematic replacement of natural gas in cogeneration plants and district heating networks using renewable sources national electricity production is growing without emitting greenhouse gases4142. Despite sustained population growth and resulting construction activities amount of emissions generated by buildings in 2019 was almost equal to that of 2005. sum 60% were due to residential buildings.

Towards climate neutrality by 2050 20 / 97 4 Development and further updates of the strategy The long-term national climate action strategy defines the strategic vision of the climate neutrality of Luxembourg by 2050 at the latest and it outlines the transformation of economy and society required to achieve it. Thereby main fields of action and strategic measures for a successful transition in all sectors concerned: energy system; buildings; mobility; economy; food and agriculture; forestry and carbon sinks; sustainable finance. A summary and qualitative presentation of the financing aspects to implement the transition to climate neutrality and elements to take into account to ensure a just transition as well as an overview of the strategy in adaptation to climate change complete the document. As agreed in the 2018-2023 coalition agreement44 national climate policy for 2050. In addition long-term strategy at European and international level. In effect 2018/1999 on the governance of the energy union and climate action45 requires the establishment for at least thirty years. Furthermore present long-term low GHG emission development strategies to the UNFCCC. Given the cross-cutting nature of climate action indispensable between the various competent ministerial departments in the sectors concerned. Thereby the aim of ensuring the coherence of sectoral policies with the objective of climate neutrality ministries have provided their contributions relating to the guidelines and main fields of action and policy measures in their respective areas. Later long-term plan has been agreed with a view to its adoption by the Council of Government. This one marked its agreement with the preliminary draft dated July 30, 2021. Next General public. It was made accessible on the national portal of public inquiries and on the portal from the Ministry of the Environment invited to submit their comments and suggestions by October 12, 2021. The final draft of the strategy was adopted by the Council of Government on October 29, 2021. The strategy covering an extended period of thirty years regular. It should be noted that the aforementioned Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 provides every five years day will make it possible to complete and refine the strategy and innovations in this area as well as the conclusions arising from the dialogue that is established in the climate policy governance framework. While this strategy outlines the transition to be made in the long term the main medium-term planning instrument 44 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 45 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:02018R1999-20210101&from=EN 46 See explanations concerning the law relating to the climate in the chapter “Governance and active participation of all actors of the transition” Towards climate neutrality in 2050 21 / 97 in detail the policies and measures allowing Luxembourg to embark on a trajectory of reduction of GHG emissions compatible with climate neutrality in 2050. Towards climate neutrality in 2050 22 / 97 5 Towards climate neutrality in 2050 5.1 Strategic vision By 2050 at the latest long-term goal is to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by offsetting residual emissions carbon sink. The Luxembourg economy will be decarbonized will contribute to the well-being of citizens improving public health and supporting the halting of biodiversity loss. 5.2  Mission Achieving climate neutrality implies a profound transformation of the economy and the society the supply of energy and exhaustible resources. This process has challenges considerable environmental: job creation air and water Succeed in the transition to a net-zero GHG emissions economy and take advantage of opportunities associated with it is not a purely technological challenge economic. The transition must therefore be socially just and economically efficient and aspire to a maximum valuation of the co-benefits mentioned public. It is only with the participation of all that it will be possible to succeed in such a social project. The The success of the transition essentially depends on the acceptance it will meet with from the population. It is therefore necessary to work on an attractive perspective for all by following a integrated approach. To achieve the transformation initiated by this strategy confidence within our society and among all economic players that this change is necessary change The facilitating framework should include the appropriate instruments to consolidate governance and the active participation of all actors in the transition mobilize research and promote innovation financing and socially equitable. The complexity of the mission and the interdependence of policies and measures in terms of action for climate require effective governance and intense coordination between all actors in particular the ministerial departments concerned. The strategies energy investments commerce budget and finance the objective of climate neutrality and therefore of this strategy. Towards climate neutrality by 2050 23 / 97 The involvement of companies and citizens will promote the confidence that they will put into the transition and hence their acceptance of it. Education and raising awareness will help stimulate individual and collective action. Environmental protection and climate protection go hand in hand with health protection of the Luxembourg population. A slowdown in climate change will have automatically have a positive impact on human health. The integration of this concept will allow citizens to better understand and accept the proposed measures in the implementation. It is also important to improve the resilience and adaptive capacities of society Luxembourg's economy and natural environment to climate change. Ultimately majors shortage of resources development and adoption of nature-based solutions. 5.3 Guiding Principles The following guiding principles will guide the transition to climate neutrality in Luxembourg: 1. Exploit the potential for reducing anthropogenic GHG emissions so as not to have to offset by absorptions that the residual emissions 2. Socially just transition: leaving no one behind; 3. Economically efficient and financially viable transition: preserve or even improve the competitiveness of Luxembourg sustainably healthy and balanced; 4. Involve society and economic actors in the design of the transition; 5. Integrated approach: promoting an approach that respects development objectives sustainability of the 2030 Agenda 6. Clear legislative and policy framework coherence of the Luxembourg legislative and policy framework (including strategies instruments and investments) with the objective of climate neutrality; 7. Facilitating EU framework: work for and take advantage of a favorable EU framework that is essential for a successful transition from a small open economy to neutrality climate; 8. Regional cooperation and with other Member States: cooperating in the Greater Region and with the other Member States to improve the efficiency and speed of the transition; 9. Green finance: exploiting the strengths of the Luxembourg financial center ecosystem to successfully finance the green transition nationally and globally; 10. Post-COVID-19 green recovery: take advantage of post-COVID-19 economic recovery programs COVID-19 to accelerate the transition; 11. Integrated reduction of environmental harm: do not act to the detriment of health human the environment and make the most of the co-benefits human; 12. Waiver of the promotion of nuclear energy; 13. Improving resilience: do no harm to resilience of the natural environment to climate change. Towards climate neutrality in 2050 24 / 97 6 Acting for climate neutrality Successfully transitioning to climate neutrality in Luxembourg by 2050 at the latest requires a action taken coordinated and effective deployment of policies description of the primary cross-cutting policies and actions forming the facilitating framework to be implemented in place presented by field of action buildings; mobility; economy; food and agriculture; forestry and carbon sinks; sustainable finance. 6.1 Facilitating framework for the transition to climate neutrality The facilitating framework should in particular include the appropriate instruments for effective governance effective and the active participation of all actors in the transition through tax policy sustainable public finances sustainable public procurement territorial and urban engagement of society and expand the key role of education and training as well as strengthen the EU framework for climate action transition: the implementation of a just transition and the provision of financing adequate47. 6.1.1 Governance and active participation of all actors in the transition National governance in terms of climate action must be strengthened over time to ensure the success of a mission of this magnitude. The governance model must in particular to be equipped with organs It must ensure a coordinated approach levels and thus allow policy coherence sectors with the objective of climate neutrality within a predictable framework. In order to facilitate the support and commitment of the whole of society an ongoing multi-level dialogue on action to the climate between all the stakeholders scientist public administration relating to the climate48 the climate policy observatory contributes to ensuring the coherence of climate action legal obligations of all ministerial departments and administrations involved. Together with the anchoring of the long-term national objective of climate neutrality and the objective intermediate level by 203049 climate change with the aim of holding sectors accountable in their role of contributing to the achieving the necessary GHG emission reductions. In effect only if the responsibility is shared and assumed by all the sectors and actors concerned. One 47 See the chapters “Financing the transition to climate neutrality” and “Ensuring a transition fair " 48 Amended law of 15 December 2020 relating to the climate 49 See the chapter “National context” Towards climate neutrality in 2050 25 / 97 Grand-Ducal regulation determines the respective annual allocations of the sectors for a first period up to 2030 and for each subsequent period. The governance model must be based on continuous monitoring and ex-ante and ex-assessments. post-regular to monitor compliance with the greenhouse gas emissions reduction trajectory tight useful adjustments without delay. It is therefore necessary to acquire monitoring instruments and analytical tools and organize the support of competent partners. Specifically draft legislation on GHG emissions Consistency of legislative acts with climate objectives. The climate pact with municipalities51 is a cornerstone of climate governance national. It sets the framework for the active participation of local authorities citizens and local businesses to the transition. In effect design and implementation of climate and energy policy at local level. The municipalities benefit from technical assistance and financial support which depends in particular the level of certification achieved on the basis of a catalog of measures structured into 6 categories (also covering the themes of the circular economy and air quality). All Luxembourg municipalities are committed to the pact and three levels of certification. Under the law of June 25, 2021 creating a 2.0 climate pact with the municipalities weather goals 2030 consolidation of the quantitative approach the offer of advice and tools grassroots advisers) and increased support for municipalities in their efforts to integrate the population businesses and other local actors. In this way as a central instrument for the implementation of climate and energy policy national at municipal level. Municipalities are also essential partners in the protection of nature and natural resources and following the positive experiences gathered by the climate pact based on the model of the climate pact is established by the law of July 30, 2021 creating a natural pact with the municipalities. Through the nature pact financial councils in favor of the preservation and restoration of biodiversity and services ecosystems. The interaction between the two pacts will provide a valuable element of management integrated at the local level of environmental crises. For exemple to the effects of climate change initiatives in favor of wetlands – important carbon stocks and sinks – will also benefit both climate protection and nature protection. 50 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 51 https://www.pacteclimat.lu/fr/accueil Towards climate neutrality by 2050 26 / 97 6.1.2 Tax policy: providing the necessary incentives Tax policy is a powerful instrument to encourage consumers and producers to adopt a sustainable behavior in pricing and providing the necessary incentives. In the current context of the transition to climate neutrality climatic. In parallel green economy and contribute to a socially just transition. This is to review progressively tax rates for fuels and fossil fuels (including subject to the CO tax described below) and to manage resources more responsibly 2 among other things by better taking into account the polluter-pays principle52 taking social considerations into account. Currently to neighboring countries. related to purchasing power EU member states. This situation poses certain challenges in terms of climate policy and energy. The Government is aware of this and the development and implementation of a predictable and coherent tax policy appropriate to social policy realities and challenges environmental. The taxation of energy and resources should progressively and in a way foreseeable to be revised upwards consumption and favoring renewable resources. Generally develop and promote the incentive effects of taxation in terms of mobility economic activities or agriculture provisions that can lead to incentives contrary to the protection of the environment. A successful tax policy is socially just and economically efficient. It generates the revenue to fund the coveted policy while promoting social equity. In this regard coalition55 mentions in particular that “the revenue generated by an increase in taxation energy will make it possible to finance the societal efforts necessary for a successful transition ecological and to reinforce its social equity”. Knowing that the GHG emissions attributed to Luxembourg are dominated for two thirds by the road transport sector fuels is inevitable to achieve a trajectory compatible with the objective of neutrality climatic. In accordance with the coalition agreement56 and heating oil) will be adapted with the aim of achieving the objectives subscribed to by Luxembourg in the framework of the Paris Agreements” (in particular through the CO tax introduced as part of the PNEC). 2 Specifically price differences with neighboring countries. A tax instrument capable of guiding the economy and society towards climate neutrality in a economically efficient is carbon pricing. Effective carbon pricing may encourage changes in consumer and business behavior and 52 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 53 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 54 To consider Sustainable Development – Environmentally Harmful Subsidies in Luxembourg» 55 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 56 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 Towards climate neutrality in 2050 27 / 97 stimulate sustainable investments. In addition to the emissions trading system for greenhouse gas emissions (ETS)57 focusing on high-intensity industrial sectors energy EU members. Obviously together a coherent framework. The introduction of a national carbon price was decided within the framework of the PNEC. From 2021 CO emissions resulting from the energy use of fuels and fossil fuels 2 outside the ETS are subject to a CO tax set at 20 euros per ton of CO for the year 2021. 2 2 annual increase of 5 euros per ton of CO is planned for 2022 and 2023. Indeed 2 carbon pricing will have to be gradually adapted to reach and maintain a trajectory consistent with climate neutrality in 2050. The non-fossil share of biofuels and biofuels is exempt from the tax. For the sake of social equity, revenue from the CO tax is 2 used in a balanced way between concrete measures to combat climate change climate change and tax and social measures with a view to reducing the costs targeted in favor of low-income households. Ultimately housing/renovation modal towards public transport and active mobility accelerated by an amplification of the incentive effect of vehicle taxation favoring electric vehicles and other vehicles with zero or low CO emissions. The coalition agreement59 2 provides that by updating the tax benefit for company cars (representing currently about 40% of new registrations) of CO will be more favored 2 travel by means other than the car alternative to that for company cars will be introduced. From fiscal year 2021 encourage the owners of rented accommodation to carry out an energy renovation durable investment in renovation benefiting from PRIMe House financial aid. In order to promote circular economy 3% on eligible repair work under EU law. 6.1.3 Sustainable public finance: integrating climate aspects into the State budget The transition to climate neutrality requires significant public and private investment. the financial challenge is to mobilize investment flows in favor of green priorities in order to ensure consistency with climate objectives. Like taxation, which is one of them. central component must themselves be made compatible with climate neutrality sustainably sound and balanced public finances through budgeting in accordance with the budgetary trajectory and the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. Fiscal policy will hand in hand with climate commitments. It should be noted in this context that budgetary expenditure 57 Directive 2003/87/EC (amended) establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading greenhouse in the Union 58 PNEC 59 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 60 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 Towards climate neutrality by 2050 28 / 97 in particular in terms of public transport have increased significantly over the course of the last years in Luxembourg. This investment policy will be continued. Firstly and key projects related to mobility must help mobilize the private investment required for a successful transition and this in particular through a tax policy that creates the appropriate incentive effects62 and aid schemes. Public funds and existing aid schemes climate neutral are presented. New instruments may complete the system to fill the gaps or even capitalizing on emerging opportunities. It is a question of creating reinforced and socially fair in terms of mobility forestry climate63. Two other recent developments are worth mentioning. In execution of the coalition agreement climate law and Energy both in terms of food and eligible investments. The changes make the fund even better able to face current and future challenges of action. Furthermore energy and climate measures included in the PNEC is quantified by the departments ministries concerned at the level of the State budget and the multiannual program64. The integration of climate aspects into public finances necessarily concerns both the side of expenses than revenue. Knowing that a consequent and continuous decline in sales and export of fuels is required to meet climate goals dependence of public finances on resources from the sale of fuels by taking continuous measurements » performance in terms of CO emissions for vehicles66 will in any case lead to 2 way to reduce fuel requirements. Generally stipulated by Article 2.1 c) of the Paris Agreement profile of evolution towards low greenhouse gas emission and climate-resilient development climatic changes ". Ultimately benchmark for sovereign sustainability bonds matter of green financing. Issuing sustainable bonds enables the Government to finance public spending that contributes positively to environmental and social objectives and 61 In this respect ambitious investment plan to further improve infrastructure and quality of life. » 62 See the chapter “Fiscal policy: providing the necessary incentives” 63 Consider Sustainable Development – Environmentally Harmful Subsidies in Luxembourg» 64 Ministry of Finance multiannual 2020-2024 65 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 66 Regulations (EU) 2019/631 setting CO emission performance standards for 2 new passenger cars and for new light commercial vehicles as well as Regulation (EU) 2019/1242 setting CO emission performance standards for new heavy-duty vehicles 2 Towards climate neutrality in 2050 29 / 97 thus act as a catalyst to meet Luxembourg's commitments under the the Paris Agreement and the United Nations 2030 Agenda. The framework also helps establish a level greater transparency on sustainable spending in the state budget. It allows the issuance of three types of bonds: purely green bonds green and social). The revenue resulting from these obligations is only allocated to the financing or the refinancing of eligible expenses relating in particular to the energy transition development of low-carbon transport climate finance or environmental protection in general and access to services essentials such as health According to the coalition agreement67 du Luxembourg (FSIL) will be oriented according to the criteria of responsible finance. According to the “Luxembourg Sustainable Finance Roadmap”68 compensation. Note that since 2020 principles of sustainable finance in the investment strategy of the FSIL69. 6.1.4 Sustainable public procurement: consolidating the pioneering role of the State and municipalities Public powers showing the example. Their weight on the market stimulates the development and supply of innovative and sustainable products and solutions. In order to make full use of this lever forerunner of the public sector must be consolidated buildings sustainability in public tenders will enhance the desired leverage effect. In this context ecotechnologies”70 and that “the law on public procurement will be used to promote the economy circular”71. In effect promote consideration of criteria other than price when awarding the contract ecological criteria or social criteria. Particularly important criteria for the climate neutral  Taking into account the total cost over the entire useful life of the product or service operating costs (such as energy)  Consideration of greenhouse gas emissions over the entire useful life cycle of products or services life cycle;  Renewable nature of products to avoid mobilizing fossil resources preferring materials capable of storing carbon  Consideration of properties that allow maintaining or recovering the value of products on their separability) be verified through electronic data records materials ; 67 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 68 See the chapter “Sustainable finance” 69 Luxembourg Sustainable Finance Strategy Sustainable-Finance-Strategy_EN.pdf 70 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 71 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 “life cycle” approach which will notably take into account the carbon footprint. » Towards climate neutrality in 2050 30 / 97  Promotion of new service models such as the “product as a service” concept or the sharing In pursuit of climate neutrality gradually strengthened to impose zero/low carbon or even negative emissions solutions based in particular on the holistic principles of the circular economy and balance sheets comprehensive environments. In the construction sustainability and circularity in their specifications sustainable and biobased materials such as wood72. Drawing on the experiences of recent years and best available practices sustainable audiences constructions than the renovation of the real estate heritage. While pursuing an approach holistic approach integrating the panoply of aspects of sustainability and the circular economy and guaranteeing the health of the occupants user acceptance buildings constructed or renovated. Minimized energy requirements are fully covered by renewable energies integrated into all buildings. To cover the remaining needs 100% renewable and high environmental quality green electricity. In the spirit of a integrated approach transport public in sufficient numbers. Effective management of the real estate portfolio is essential in order to fully benefit from the efforts consented. The operation of individual buildings must be optimized. In this regard coalition provides that “public buildings will be subject to a management and audit system ecological”73. Furthermore multifunctional available surfaces and the use of telework help to limit the need for additional surface. School buildings deserve special attention the use of non-toxic materials and effective ventilation impeccable interior. Public developers have an important role to play in the development of housing projects examples and in the development of decarbonized eco-districts social and high quality of life. The same public promoters are called upon to renovate their rental portfolio gradually. In addition to buildings important automobiles electric vehicles or exceptional or for specific vehicles. 72 Note that a new version of the sustainable construction and renovation guide (http://www.crtib.lu/fr/guide-construction-durable) will be developed. 73 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 Towards climate neutrality in 2050 31 / 97 Regarding consumer goods circulars and local or regional74 is to be favored by the systematic application of sustainability and quality in public tenders. Standardization of criteria for the different product groups as well as tendering tools will make it possible to strengthen the leverage exerted by public markets. In this context establishment of a “competence center – public contracts”75 and the development of specifications model76. Centralized management of public procurement could further facilitate an approach consistent and improve its effectiveness. In order to strengthen the pioneering role of the State in consultation with all ministries the state administration from 204077. It should be noted that the climate pact with the municipalities78, supplemented in particular by financial aid granted to specific municipal projects supports them technically and financially in their pioneering role at the local level. A tool facilitating the implementation of sustainable criteria and circulars in the purchase of certain types of products is made available to municipalities. These criteria are also directly reinforced by the Climate Pact 2.0. It should be noted that public markets are also identified as key tools in the “Null Offall Lëtzebuerg »79 or still the strategy in the matter of circular economy« Strategy Kreeslafwirtschaft Lëtzebuerg »80 and that the law on waste and resources requires the taking into account the waste pyramid concept when awarding contracts. 6.1.5 Exploiting the coordinating function of territorial and urban planning Spatial planning policies play a central role in the transition to neutrality climatic. Alongside energy policies spatial planning exercises an intersectoral coordinating function. In effect diffuse urbanization in rural areas requires residents to resort to different modes of transport bring citizens closer to their places of work to limit travel while developing decarbonized urban forms intelligently the different functions of housing – work – shops – leisure and adapted to the active mobility makes it possible to reduce emissions resulting from mobility needs and to improve 74 As an example especially in schools (Coalition agreement 2018-2023 75 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 76 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 77 Motion on climate neutrality adopted in the Chamber of Deputies on 29.04.2021 https://chd.lu/wps/portal/public/Accueil/TravailALaChambre/Recherche/RoleDesAffaires?action=doMotionDe tails&id=3513&backto=p0/IZ7_KHCC1240N8KQ10AN3G1BK33084=CZ6_D2DVRI420G7Q402JEJ7USN3847=M/# Z7_KHCC1240N8KQ10AN3G1BK33084 78 See the chapter “Governance and active participation of all actors in the transition” 79 MECDD offall-letzebuerg.html 80 MEA Kreeslafwirtschaft Lëtzebuerg » February/08-circular-economy-strategy/20210208-Circular-economy-strategy-Luxembourg.pdf Towards climate neutrality by 2050 32 / 97 citizens' quality of life. In this objective on three scales: national territory combined with an extremely strong economic attractiveness. System of centers of development and attraction and scale-up concentrated deconcentration national At the national level and as proposed in the context of the overhaul of the master program land use planning (PDAT) currently being finalized development and attraction (CDA) is one of the main tools of land use planning. By defining a hierarchy between urban centers investments in spatial planning policy at the national level. It has a double objective of guiding public investment policy and providing the necessary urban framework the implementation of a policy of concentrated deconcentration administrative bodies representing the State to major CDAs (without transfer of skills). The system also constitutes a reference framework of territorial logic for the sectoral policies to be impact territorial One of the strategies to be pursued must consist in maintaining a well-balanced urban framework i.e. a network of cities capable of providing equipment surrounding spaces of a balanced urban structure allows territory planning compatible with society's demands in terms of social sustainability environmental. Concentrated deconcentration promote physical proximity between the State and the citizen against the nuisances caused by the process of metropolisation ever-increasing concentration of people and activities in the City of Luxembourg. This metropolisation generates problems and negative externalities in terms of congestion highways even though the outskirts or rural areas may be faced with attractiveness deficits or negative growth dynamics. Coupled with concentrated deconcentration contributes to structuring the national territory and organizing flows and new settlements. In acting on these central places influence of the latter and contribute avoiding in particular a scattering of the polarities or an excessive dilution in the space of the residential function countryside. The CDA system and concentrated deconcentration are key instruments for bringing or even regroup residential functions different ADCs. This grouping reduces the need for motorized travel congestion of the main roads by redirecting on roads other than the roads penetrating the flow of workers to the capital and contributes to improving the attractiveness residential and professional CDAs local economic fabric Towards climate neutrality in 2050 33 / 97 Thus residential areas in rural areas and concentrating most of the activities in the capital Luxembourgish and attraction and concentrated deconcentration allows sustainable territorial development climate friendly and resilient. Territorial visions and eco-urbanism at the local level As part of the overhaul of the master program for land use planning (PDAT) which defines an integrated strategy for sector programming with development implications territory and decides on the guidelines municipalities for the three urban agglomerations of the country: the Nordstad South. To facilitate the subsequent implementation of the objectives territorial visions State-municipal territorial cooperation agreements. They should promote a sustainable and innovative urban development and ensure that rational land use is proposed by reconciling urban and economic development functional digital and ecological. The strategic orientations and the objectives set in the visions will be integrated into the next PDAT currently being developed. Besides the eco-urbanism approach with positive impacts at the neighborhood level by promoting the construction durable resources and carbon neutrality as well as collaborative and participatory processes. This guide is aimed at all actors involved in the development of neighborhoods and who wish to achieve neighborhoods that can be qualified as eco-districts by proposing a frame of reference and innovative concepts. The eco-urbanism approach must play a central role in the rehabilitation industrial wastelands. An urban-architectural and landscape consultation focused on the functional region of the Luxembourg bilateral at international level For Luxemburg essential to take into account the cross-border dimension when defining its strategic guidelines and its territorial development policies. With a very high share cross-border workers development of cross-border workers raise major mobility issues apprehended in a concerted cross-border approach. This same principle applies to many other themes such as, for example, economic activity zones. It is with this in mind that in 2020 Regional Planning has launched an urban-architectural and landscape consultation “Luxembourg in Transition – Territorial visions for the decarbonized and resilient future of the region Luxembourg function”81. The consultation aims to collect strategic proposals land-use planning and to produce territorial scenarios of ecological transition to 81 https://luxembourgintransition.lu/ Towards climate neutrality by 2050 34 / 97 the 2050 horizon for the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and its cross-border area. In this way regional planning policy will be able to specify its contribution to the strategy towards climate neutrality. The “Luxembourg in Transition” consultation is based on a multidisciplinary approach bringing together teams made up of architects environmental experts citizen participation through the “Biergerkommitee Lëtzebuerg 2050”. It is organized in three stages intended to provide territorial scenarios of ecological transition proposals for concrete pilot projects. To sketch these scenarios each step develop tools interdisciplinary with the functional region of Luxembourg as a case study and main object. The process is steered by an interministerial committee bringing together of Territorial Development Climate and Sustainable Development and Public Works. It is supported by a multidisciplinary Scientific Committee of 15 internationally renowned personalities and by an Advisory Committee made up of the entities competent institutions in territorial terms cross-border territorial engineering promote regional exchange of knowledge and experience. A citizens' committee "Biergerkommitee Lëtzebuerg 2050" of 30 people representing the residents of the Grand Duchy and its cross-border region brings its own vision of the organization of the territory to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. The results expected from the consultation have a dual purpose 1. Guide land use planning policies by proposing visions for the territorial development of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg by 2050 work on the overhaul of the PDAT; and 2. Initiate pilot projects intended to function as demonstrators of the capacity of the Luxembourg society to embark on the path of ecological transition. Cross-border cooperation at the level of the Greater Region and Territorial Development of the Greater Region (SDT-GR)82 pursues similar objectives. The SDT- GR aims to provide the Greater Region with a common territorial development strategy sustainable and is based on four axes decarbonized and resilient. At the bilateral level cross-border conurbations83 and natural parks. 6.1.6 Mobilizing research and promoting innovation and digitization Although many solutions exist in all sectors and thus suggest that a decarbonizing society is within reach by mid-century remain prerequisites for achieving climate neutrality. Better or even new solutions are essential to overcome persistent challenges and exploit potentials 82 https://amenagement-territoire.public.lu/fr/grande-region-affaires-transfrontalieres/SDT-GR.html 83 For example d’Alzette-Belval and the concept of territorial development along the German-Luxembourg border. Towards climate neutrality by 2050 35 / 97 additional reduction in GHG emissions. The transition to a zero-emissions economy nets requires, on the one hand, the continuation of technological development and innovation and the other the strengthening of systemic approaches and environmental innovations and economic. To facilitate technology deployment and innovation transfer A close relationship must be established between research and innovation and sectoral strategic measures. Transformative solutions to be developed or perfected include renewable energies and the energy efficiency of products and systems in the fields of building and mobility (including batteries) energy-intensive industries or agro-environmental technologies and carbon sequestration in soils. Systemic approaches are to be developed through intersectoral coupling and cooperation. The circular economy is a good example. While taking advantage of research and innovation at European and global level Luxembourg is required to consolidate and intensify its efforts in this area to serve the implementation implementation of the transition in the national context. This involves targeted public support entrepreneurial engagement and mobilization of the entire innovation system the public research centers LIST84 and LISER85 as well as the University of Luxembourg86 Luxinnovation87 and its innovation clusters such as the Luxembourg CleanTech Cluster88 and the centers private research and innovation. The limited size of Luxembourg allows it to deploy rapid and demonstration of key technologies and innovations and thus play a pioneering role at the scale of a country. Investments in innovation and research in Luxembourg must guide the actors economic in the profound transformation underway. It is about seizing the opportunities offered by the transition for the development and economic diversification of the country. Environmental technologies already form one of the priorities of Luxembourg's economic diversification strategy. the development and transfer of solutions towards climate neutrality need to be further supported to ensure long-term competitiveness economic term. As it happens business models aimed at offering services and products that reduce the carbon footprint to consider Grand Duchy of Luxembourg”89. In its entirety transformation and innovation of Luxembourg society and economy. She is articulated around energy challenges finance With a view to consolidating the expertise of public research institutions in Luxembourg and support research and innovation activities in order to serve the implementation of the Luxembourg 2030 vision of a sustainable knowledge society 84 Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology : https://www.list.lu/ 85 Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research : https://www.liser.lu/ 86 https://wwwfr.uni.lu/ 87 National Agency for the Promotion of Innovation and Research: https://www.luxinnovation.lu/fr/ 88 https://www.luxinnovation.lu/cluster/luxembourg-cleantech-cluster/ 89 https://www.troisiemerevolutionindustrielle.lu/etude-strategique/ Towards climate neutrality in 2050 36 / 97 December 2019 this strategy United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (in line with the 10 fields of action priorities of the 3rd National Plan for Sustainable Development) as well as the political orientations of the European Commission priority research areas societal sustainable and responsible. This area is divided into four sub-themes present context: “climate change: energy efficiency and intelligent management of energy / resilient ecosystems and agrosystems” and “economic development: green finance and sustainable / circular and sharing economy”. In the implementation of the strategy focus on interdisciplinarity by combining the expertise of different disciplines and different institutions. In this sense strategy also aims to strengthen coordination between the various players in the research sector and innovation. Research priorities include:  Sustainable construction incorporating energy efficiency circularity and health-environment aspects (in new and existing constructions) and “sustainable development and smart cities”;  Intelligent electricity management systems/grids integrating the energies renewables and electromobility (thus promoting intersectoral coupling);  “Sustainable behaviors”: sociological aspects around the emergence of lifestyles “positive climate” and social consequences of the evolution of the energy transition;  Instruments and economic models consuming less resources and producing less negative effects on the environment sustainability and the circular economy and the sharing economy;  Development of technologies for the permanent monitoring of the effects of climate change and scenario modeling to best adapt to an environment changing. Particular attention should be paid to agricultural and forestry activities but also to the prevention of extreme events or the availability of water. Digitization is one of the key subjects of innovation and research capable of supporting the transition in all relevant sectors: smart energy networks smart 4.0 Luxembourg91 is a multidisciplinary government initiative collaborating with stakeholders public Luxembourg’s “Data-Driven Innovation Strategy”92 presents a digitalization roadmap priority sectors for economic development. 90 Ministry of Higher Education and Research assets/documents/actualites/2020/02-february/25-mesr-strategie-recherche-innovation/mesr-strategie- research-innovation.pdf 91 https://digital-luxembourg.public.lu/ 92 Ministry of Economy sustainable economy in Luxembourg economy/artificial-intelligence/data-driven-innovation.html Towards climate neutrality in 2050 37 / 97 The challenge is to benefit from the digital transformation while minimizing the needs infrastructure (including data centers) and connected applications. In effect Considerable progress in the energy efficiency of these technologies must be made. Thanks to the progressive digitization of work facilitating the decoupling of professional activity and workspace society in transition mobility needs and all the associated nuisances considerably. remote work including videoconferences professionals both inside and outside the country. The fact that the Luxembourg economy is largely based on services telework. Thereby majority of EU member states. The health crisis linked to the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated further acceptance of this form of work. According to an opinion of the Economic and Social Council regular and alternating will probably become for half of the Luxembourg population the normality in the years to come. In order to exploit the undeniable advantages of remote working the objective must be its anchoring as a permanent instrument in the work culture as well both in the private sector and in public administration. To this end related aspects of labor law and to continue to promote and facilitate teleworking for its citizens and their cross-border workers introduces workflows that allow and promote remote work and develop skills needed by their employees. Telework also requires IT infrastructure efficient construction and the real estate market must anticipate by developing building concepts flexible and modular In this context benefits. It is undeniable that teleworking in terms of the physical and mental health of employees. Teleworking also makes the organization internal within companies more difficult and can have negative effects on the development of economy and employment. An example is the lack of interaction between colleagues the erosion of social working relationships which are not suitable resulting in loss of jobs and those for whom telework is impossible. It is therefore necessary to take all these aspects into account when the development of teleworking. It is also important to consider the tax implications taking into account the provisions arising from bilateral agreements for the avoidance of double taxation with neighboring countries applicable. In terms of social security not residing in Luxembourg 93 During confinement in April and May 2020 teleworking compared to 20% in 2019. (Source: STATEC https://statistiques.public.lu/fr/actualites/population/travail/2020/05/20200519/20200519.pdf) 94 Opinion of the Economic and Social Council https://ces.public.lu/dam-assets/fr/avis/themes-europeens/2020-teletravail.pdf Towards climate neutrality in 2050 38 / 97 social security provides that when an employee works more than 25% of his working time in his Country of Residence This rule also applies to all sectors and countries of the European economic area. Since then exceeding the 25% threshold while remaining affiliated to Luxembourg requires either a modification of the European regulation different countries of residence of employees. 6.1.7 Promoting societal engagement and expanding the role of education and training The deep transformation required to achieve climate neutrality cannot be accomplished only if it meets with the acceptance of the population and if everyone commits as a citizen consumer and worker. It is only with the contribution of all that it will be possible to succeed. Citizens need to embrace change transformation as something beneficial. By their choices decisively influence the products and services offered. The choices made at the time to buy a house carbon for years. Lifestyle choices at the individual level can make a real difference more vegetal or for walking increasing willingness to adopt sustainable behaviors is observed must be supported to make it the norm. To achieve this in place of zero/low carbon solutions as described throughout this strategy strengthening their active participation and expanded education and training. Active participation of citizens and consumers To mobilize society climate change and above all also in favor of solutions need to be further developed. This involves, among other things, encouraging and supporting the choices of sustainable consumption by providing reliable and easily accessible information understandable about sustainability by labeling) existing95 citizens’ climate action plan. Next their ideas and develop ambitious actions permanent multilevel dialogue integrating citizens is established within the framework of governance of the climate policy as laid down by the law relating to the climate96. Note that experiments useful were collected during the participation of citizens and students in the workshops public consultation organized as part of the development of the PNEC. Facing the climate emergency our society is multiplying. For illustration 95 See in particular the myenergy website durable : https://www.myenergy.lu/ 96 See the chapter “Governance and active participation of all actors in the transition” Towards climate neutrality in 2050 39 / 97 activities based on the sharing or exchange of goods (sharing economy97 / consumption collaborative) or take part in the production of the product they consume (as prosumers). Concrete examples are community gardens pooling of goods and equipment self-consumption of renewable electricity consumers (energy). In order to multiply these initiatives clear frame information and best practices in this area. A study carried out in 201898 proposes measures in this direction for the sharing economy. A favorable legal framework is being created for individual/collective self-consumption and energy communities. The instrument of the climate pact with municipalities99 is predestined to stimulate citizen participation on a large scale. In recognition of its importance in societal transformation Climate 2.0 places particular emphasis on citizen engagement. In effect guaranteed to municipalities in their efforts to integrate the population. Note that the involvement of citizens will be able to promote the confidence they will place in the transition and therefore their acceptance of the latter. Key role of education and training Effective climate action in the sense of transformative action societal skills to act as a citizen fundamental to higher education The entire education and training system plays a decisive role in the transmission of these knowledge and skills development. It is therefore essential to develop continuously the system so that it can:  Equip young and old to better understand the challenges of change climate;  Encourage change of attitude  Qualify young people for the professional profiles required professional transitions and school draw for tomorrow. The reference point for extensive climate protection education is the United Nations 2030 Agenda with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals Luxembourg by the 3rd National Plan for Sustainable Development100. The government there identified its 10 priorities all” and “(6) Protect the climate”. The Ministry of National Education 97 The sharing economy aims to optimize the utilization rate of underutilized goods that the property reduction in resource consumption. 98  LSE  Consulting  and  VVA  Economics  and  Policy https://meco.gouvernement.lu/dam-assets/publications/rapport-etude-analyse/minist-economie/sharing- economy/Ministry-of-the-Economy-Sharing-Economy-Policy-in-Luxembourg-Final.pdf 99 See the chapter “Governance and active participation of all actors in the transition” 100 Ministry of the Environment National Plan for Sustainable Development https://environnement.public.lu/content/dam/environnement/documents/developpement- durable/PNDD.pdf Towards climate neutrality by 2050 40 / 97 Jeunesse takes the interdependence of these priorities to heart by setting clear objectives in the coalition agreement101: “Political action at the level of National Education Youth will be in line with the objectives of education for sustainable development defined in United Nations 2030 Agenda” and “Education for sustainable development will be part of basic training and continuing education for professionals”. Educational offers around climate change in the sense of development education sustainability address the complexity of the themes and dimensions of everyday life and develop options for action for the individual as well as for society. Thereby "As for school programs complexity of the challenges of our society sustainable future and to act as responsible citizens for present and future generations”. In this regard and based on ongoing actions such as the “School Futures” research project103 the platform «Action-Sustainability» 104 “Öko-check” pilot aimed at evaluating and improving the ecological footprint of establishments secondary education and the network of school gardens “Schoulgäärt” sustainable development and climate) will be encouraged as a methodological tool in the exemplary curricula and behaviors of the school community will be stimulated. In the diversity of the structured education system (formal and non-formal) collaboration between actors timely transfer of scientific knowledge into teaching practices and of learning at all levels are prerequisites for effective education in climate protection adaptation to the hazards of climate change. Thereby and teaching materials will be further networked BNE - Education for Sustainable Development 105 l’initiative « ClimateXchange »106 The labor market is constantly changing digital transformation. The skills required by the workforce are changing. Again professional profiles are emerging at an accelerated pace. In the field of education and formation these developments in the labor market different sectors of educational activities. The training offer will be developed accordingly and appropriate curricula. It should be noted in this context that a series of new training courses have already been developed in recent years 101 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 102 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 103 https://sustainabilityscience.uni.lu/school-futures/?lang=en 104 https://www.aktioun-nohaltegkeet.lu/ 105 www.bne.lu 106 https://portal.education.lu/climatexchange: Following the engagement of pupils in the framework of mouvements Fridays for Future et Youth for Climate students. Four exchange meetings were organised. The National Student Conference of Luxembourg has compiled the students' demands in a report (https://www.cnel.lu/wp- content/uploads/2018/07/climateXchange-rapport-sanssign-final.pdf) which was submitted to the Government in June 2019. Towards climate neutrality in 2050 41 / 97 that the Maison de l’Orientation assesses the needs and skills necessary for jobs in the future 6.1.8 Strengthening the EU framework for climate action To succeed in the targeted transition of the Luxembourg economy – a small open economy in the European Economic Area – it is essential to be able to rely on a solid EU framework:  Legal framework aligned with climate objectives renewable  Financial framework compatible with climate ambition contributing adequately to the financing of the transition;  European research and infrastructure programs supporting key sectors of the transition. As a result European medium- and long-term decarbonization. Specifically following are of decisive importance for the support of national policies and must be adapted to the heightened climate ambition:  European energy efficiency and renewable energy targets;  EU GHG Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) aviation and maritime sector adequately;  CO emissions performance standards for passenger cars 2 light commercial vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles;  Ecodesign requirements for products;  Circular economy and industrial dimension;  Electricity market;  Common agricultural policy. It should be noted that the European Commission presented on July 14, 2021 a legislative package including proposals to strengthen some of these policies EU greenhouse gas emission allowances and performance standards for CO2 emissions for vehicles. In this context borders is also proposed. In effect achieving climate neutrality by 2050 could be compromised by the lack of ambition of other major emitters worldwide. This would result in a risk of leakage of carbon by relocating industrial production to countries that are less demanding in terms of climatic. In order to counteract this risk and avoid the importation of goods whose production is accelerating global warming Towards climate neutrality in 2050 42 / 97 Climate diplomacy The national effort for the transition to climate neutrality is part of the European framework of a ambitious climate action Luxembourg is committed to the fight against climate change motivate other countries to follow the example. In effect would compromise the achievement of the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The national objective of climate neutrality therefore extends well beyond the simple dimension of domestic climate and energy policy. In this context national climate goals necessarily imply a change in supply energy with certain trading partners. States that genuinely commit to compliance with the Paris Agreement have a responsibility to choose climate-friendly solutions. He it is therefore a question of cooperating with third countries to mitigate the risks and conflicts situation therefore adds an important dimension of foreign and European policy interministerial coordination at the national level must take this into account. In this context “the importance of taking strong and coordinated action through European diplomacy active on climate” and that “the EU [will have to ensure] that its trade policy and its trade agreements are consistent with its climate ambitions”. The EU occupies a unique position as a global leader in climate action Luxembourg supports strong EU leadership in climate diplomacy. Besides existing economic and environmental arising from it. The problems accentuated by climate change include: food and water supply loss of livelihood It is therefore important to preserve and strengthen the climate change dimension of the policy foreign The Luxembourg Government is fully aware of this. This is why the coalition agreement107 provides for the development and implementation of a foreign policy that contributes to peace security climatic women as well as the rule of law and good governance strengthen the framework of international law. 107 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 Towards climate neutrality in 2050 43 / 97 6.2 Energy system As Luxembourg no longer has large power plants mainly electricity imports108 on the national balance sheet. Thereby in 2019 large power plant that was fueled by natural gas. Thanks to the development of sources of renewable energy in 2020 renewable energy sources. The same year of renewable energies compared to the total national production amounted to 81% compared to previous years. Based on the principle of energy efficiency first climate by 2050 renewable energy supply. The expansion of renewable energy sources will be facilitated through smart energy networks cross-sector couplings and the implementation of various options for energy storage and energy carriers such as hydrogen. 6.2.1 Principle of energy efficiency first The cleanest energy energy must be considered as a source of energy in its own right: it constitutes one of the most effective ways to support the transition to climate neutrality by 2050 at the same time generating countless opportunities for investment and jobs geared towards the future. The principle of energy efficiency first defined in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the governance of the Energy Union and Action for the climate as "the fact of taking the greatest account energy policy and investment decisions Cost-efficient energy alternatives aimed at making supply and demand more efficient energy active demand participation initiatives and a conversion more efficient energy distribution decisions”. Luxembourg undertakes to apply this principle horizontally in all of the policies related to the energy transition and in particular in infrastructure planning. It is therefore necessary to ensure that energy efficiency and demand mitigation are treated on an equal footing with production capacity. Energy efficiency must be taken into account when making planning or funding decisions about the system energy. Improvements in energy efficiency must also be achieved by priority whenever they prove to be more cost-effective than solutions equivalent on the supply side. This approach should contribute to the exploitation of the many 108 80 electricity 109 ILR 110 2015 : 32 Towards climate neutrality by 2050 44 / 97 benefits of energy efficiency to society Luxembourg. Particularly at the level of the PNEC primacy of energy efficiency as an "absolute priority" 40 to 44% by 2030 to examine energy investments technical plan could replace in whole or in part the projects envisaged on the supply side. This includes particular future decisions regarding investments in energy infrastructure. As developed at sector level throughout this strategy deep and sustainable building energy near-zero energy and circular efficient production the integration of the energy and transport sectors more efficient for different uses deployment of flexibility solutions on energy networks and more efficient distribution energy thanks in particular to new technologies. The dissemination of the principle of primacy of energy efficiency should be encouraged both in the public sector municipalities In synergy with a panoply of sectoral policies and measures energy efficiency111 acts as a cross-cutting instrument for promoting the use energy rational. Introduced in 2015 and reinforced for a second period from 2021 to 2030 requires electricity and natural gas suppliers to encourage consumers to reduce their energy consumption by implementing energy efficiency measures. Eligible measures are typically measures related to the energy renovation of buildings and projects energy efficiency in companies energy savings. A central aspect is the complementarity of the mechanism with the regimes financial assistance as well as consumer awareness and assistance by certain obligated parties. Thereby energy suppliers provides advice and assistance tailored to specific needs and facilitates in this way the identification and realization of projects. The Voluntary Agreement on Improving Energy Efficiency in Industry luxembourgeoise112 has been a proven instrument in this field since 1996. Member companies undertake in particular to achieve energy savings in return for advantages on the rates energy taxation. A new period with deepened and strengthened provisions starts in 2021. 6.2.2 Maximizing the deployment of renewable energies Renewable energies have experienced significant growth in Luxembourg over the past ten last years. Photovoltaic energy has recorded significant growth since 2008 111 https://www.myenergy.lu/fr/particuliers/lois-et-reglements/mecanisme-d-obligations; see also chapter " Economy " 112 https://www.myenergy.lu/fr/entreprises/grandes-entreprises-et-industries/accord-volontaire-fedil; to see also the chapter “Economy” Towards climate neutrality in 2050 45 / 97 installed electrical power has increased from 110 MW in 2010 to 187 MW in 2020 and forecasts Luxembourg ranks 6th among EU Member States. Wind energy has made an impressive leap forward since 2016. The installed capacity of the wind turbines is 153 MW in 2020. To stimulate investment in renewable energy projects regulatory account of feasible potentials and national goals. Luxembourg is sure to have reached its objective of 11% renewable energies by 2020113. However high energy demand as well as geographical and demographic constraints Luxembourg's objectives in terms of renewable energy sources had to be supported and reinforced by cross-border cooperation in a European state of mind. In 2017 cooperation agreements with Lithuania and Estonia EU countries to use the possibility of cooperation mechanisms offered by the (EU) Directive on promoting the use of energy produced from renewable sources. Guidelines for climate neutrality in 2050 It is understood that absolute priority will be given to energy efficiency according to the principle of primacy of energy efficiency renewable. As part of the PNEC 2050 from renewable energy sources. The energy supply must be sustainable and competitive in a context of decarbonization and digitalization. The transformation of the system centralized production towards a more decentralized system will be one of the key elements of the transition energy. The consumer will participate in the implementation of demand flexibility to facilitate the integration of variable renewable energies. The energy system will be highly electrified. This electrification will make it possible to enhance the maximum electricity ́ produced from renewable energy sources. The different sectors will be interconnected to allow the injection of an increasing share of renewable electricity in the network and its optimal valuation. The balance and security of the energy system energy will be ensured by sector coupling and by 2050 by H technologies (eg. 2 power-to-X). We must not lose sight of the narrowness of the national territory and therefore the limited nature of the potential nationals. The potential for national renewable electricity production will have its limits and will not will not allow coverage of national consumption located on Luxembourg territory. Interconnections with neighboring countries will play a role as well as cooperation at European level in the production of renewable energies. In this regard, European directives provide for the possibility of cooperation mechanisms in the framework of concrete projects. This will be the next step in the policy of cooperation in matters of renewable energies. Luxembourg full use of the financing mechanism under the Energy Union which will represent a considerable streamlining of administrative procedures. The Three Pillars – (i) statistical transfers guideline for Luxembourg in this field of action. Given the exiguity of its territory interconnection with especially the German electricity network and also European electricity network 113 Awaiting official 2020 figures Towards climate neutrality in 2050 46 / 97 such as renewable hydrogen through interconnection with the European gas network cross-border is logical and essential for Luxembourg. The political commitment of Luxembourg in the regional and European context will be of crucial importance. Main fields of action and strategic measures Wind energy existing injection tariffs/market premiums will be maintained. The financial contribution from municipalities and citizens will increase public acceptance for such projects. In because of the huge potential energy of the country and will be further developed in the years to come. Feed-in tariffs attractive should encourage citizens and businesses to build photovoltaic installations. In order to accelerate the expansion of photovoltaic energy tenders for large solar installations increased from year to year in order to achieve the objectives in this area. Decentralized production of solar energy will be integrated into the concepts of self-consumption and communities energy energy produced from renewable sources. The use of biomass for energy purposes will be developed and the framework strengthened to guarantee the sustainability of the biomass. Sustainability criteria will be put in place for power plants recovering forest biomass as well as waste wood. The supply radius of centers will be mainly limited to the Greater Region or to a radius corresponding to the Greater Region. The use of biomass will be done by respecting the hierarchy of use of the resource according to the principle of cascading multi-valuation. Appropriate technologies should also allow the emission of atmospheric pollutants to be minimized and compliance with the related objectives. Agriculture will also play an important role in energy production production of biogas and solar energy. With a view to improving the ecological balance of agriculture (reduction of methane and ammonia emissions etc.) reinforced dedicated crops for biogas production will be kept to a minimum. Injection of biomethane will be preferred. In order to better promote the production of biogas continuously improved. The use of renewable heat will be systematically developed in buildings residential and functional buildings allowing a decarbonization of new constructions and existing buildings. Increasing the energy performance of buildings will to use heat pumps with high coefficients of performance enhancing different environmental energy sources. The potential of deep geothermal energy will be identified from more systematically and taken into account more consistently in large-scale projects. The objective is to reduce the existing uncertainties and risks and to promote a more extensive use of geothermal energy in strategic areas. The combination of heat pumps efficient with photovoltaic installations and electrical storage systems will make it possible to create positive energy buildings. A thermal register as an instrument for energy planning favorable to the creation of urban heating networks. Heating network projects (high or low temperature) will be developed by public and private actors renewable and decentralized energy sources or data centers. Towards climate neutrality in 2050 47 / 97 To really be able to meet future demand for renewable energy cross-border will be further developed and will include concrete projects. The Benelux and the “North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC)” and also the Pentalateral Energy Forum (comprising Germany Luxembourg intends to participate in the Union platform for the development of renewable energies. Luxembourg also intends to rely on the financing mechanism of the Union on renewable energies concerning the pillar of bi- or multilateral projects of the existing structures is the Benelux and the affiliation of Luxembourg in the NSEC in other words, access to the sea and offshore wind power in Luxembourg. The European Commission has estimated that offshore wind in the North Sea can cover up to 12% of electricity consumption in the EU by 2030 and quantifies the potential of offshore wind power at 450 GW for 2050 by considering a scenario that achieves climate neutrality. Luxembourg intends to collaborate with the other countries of the NSEC on the possibilities of concrete cooperation projects Energy from Denmark. 6.2.3 About the potential role of renewable hydrogen Directive (EU) 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy produced from renewable sources recognizes hydrogen and its derivatives from renewable sources as key energy carriers that can contribute to achieving optimal exploitation of renewable energy potential across Europe energy pentalateral of June 12, 2020 called on the European Commission to define a harmonized regulatory framework for the EU and to develop a common long-term vision114 on the use of 100% renewable hydrogen to contribute to the decarbonization of the system energy in Europe. The PNEC cites hydrogen as one of the promising candidates for a decarbonized energy carrier from the future renewable. A hydrogen strategy for Luxembourg115 has been developed and adopted by the Council of Government dated July 8, 2021. It defines the vision concerning the role that will play renewable hydrogen as the energy vector of the future. Guidelines for climate neutrality in 2050 A renewable hydrogen economy should contribute to the goal of climate neutrality Luxembourg and the EU and continued as technological advances in decarbonization and in the integration and coupling of sectors. Alongside the priority aspects of improving efficiency energy and the deployment of fully renewable direct electrification recognizes the role that hydrogen and its derivatives from renewable sources can play in an indirect electrification medium and long term. Only hydrogen produced from renewable energies additional (i.e. without hindering the deployment of direct electrification entirely renewable) is seen as an energy vector that could help to decarbonize in a sustainable by 2050 the priority sectors of industry (for example the steel industry or the 114 Communication from the European Commission (COM(2020) 301 final): A hydrogen strategy for a climate-neutral Europe 115 Ministry of Energy and Spatial Planning – Department of Energy Luxembourg Hydrogen Towards climate neutrality in 2050 48 / 97 cement works) or an integrated energy system. It is understood that the production of renewable hydrogen on the territory will have its limits natural so that it is suitable focus more on the cross-border nature of suitable infrastructure and strengthen the cooperation in this area. Main fields of action and strategic measures Luxembourg will maintain efforts at European and national level in (i) the development hydrogen certification to ensure the consumption of a product that is actually decarbonized and renewable the transport of this renewable energy vector produced at an acceptable cost cooperation with EU Member States as well as with third countries for the exploitation optimal renewable. Progress around these three pillars will be key to meeting the long-term vision country term. The aforementioned hydrogen strategy retains at this stage seven strategic measures for Luxemburg:  Contribute to the definition of the framework at EU level;  Cooperate with EU Member States and third countries;  Identify opportunities in Luxembourg - Research and innovation;  Getting down to business - Flagship projects to be studied and carried out;  Prioritize actions - Towards targeted decarbonization through renewable hydrogen;  Developing instruments for a renewable hydrogen market;  Implement and continuously improve - Taskforce H2 Luxembourg. 6.2.4 Energy storage options facilitating renewable energy expansion The expansion of renewable energies leads to an availability of electrical energy in the system increasingly dynamic supply chain, in particular by following the conditions meteorological. In order to ensure supply in the future and to serve end consumers according to their needs of electricity supply. In addition to flexible production capacities and demand for more and more flexible including decentralized solutions integrated. According to a study published in 2020 by the European Commission116 storage in Europe will multiply by 2050 others due to the importance of their necessary electrical power can also contribute to supplying flexibility in the electrical system can be considered as a storage of electrical energy because it converts electricity into another form of energy reservoirs and whose consumption may take place in shifts. 116 European Commission supply in Europe. Final Report. https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/a6eba083-932e- 11ea-aac4-01aa75ed71a1 Towards climate neutrality in 2050 49 / 97 Luxembourg will participate directly in the development and provision of storage capacities sufficient. In effect electricity in Central Europe thanks to the pumped storage power plant of Vianden. However future is to further optimize the use of existing reservoirs according to the future needs of the electrical system while respecting local environmental aspects. Another potential, hardly used until now, exists in the field of energy storage by units chemical storage (such as Lithium-Ion batteries installed and used in a decentralized manner. A particularly interesting potential is perceived in the field of stationary electricity storage systems using “second life” batteries » Luxembourg will continue to develop the regulatory framework so that the various properties and externalities (including flexibility) of storage units are valued in a way non-discriminatory and integrated into the system. The structuring of network tariffs and taxes of storage is of particular importance in order to ensure a solid basis for planning long-term investments and to achieve a level playing field between storage technologies and other flexibility options. Luxembourg supports an approach technologically neutral development through targeted funding programs strengthens local know-how for the expansion and integration of storage solutions in the electrical system. In all the technological panoply available self-consumption seem particularly relevant energy communities (renewable) and the need for its extension. If today the economic viability of such systems is still difficult economically interesting composing these systems. In addition to the storage and out-of-phase injection of electricity heat storage in order to support the expansion of district heating networks and to be able to economically optimized. Thereby operation of a heat and power cogeneration plant in such a way that the heat demand is no longer the determining element for the control of the central cogeneration electricity generated or through flexibilities that have economic value in power grid management. Apart from the considerations already made in the chapter relating to the potential role of renewable hydrogen and in the context of the potential for flexibilization of hydrogen technologies hydrogen has the potential to become a significant factor in energy storage. In this perspective 117 In an optimistic scenario Cole and A. Will Frazier 73222 Towards climate neutrality in 2050 50 / 97 could be integrated into the instrumentation of the flexibility needed to manage the networks electricity in the future. 6.2.5 Smart Grid: Backbone of Energy Supply Power grids are the backbone of our energy supply today and even more tomorrow. Electricity networks traditionally have the role of transporting electricity from production centers to consumption centers and to ensure at all times balance between production and consumption. Gold the energy transition Luxembourg of the “Third Industrial Revolution”118 held that a transition would begin towards the third industrial revolution and communication (ICT) within a smart network Current electrical networks are faced with the development of new production methods especially decentralized and to a change in consumption patterns (self-consumption aggregation so-called smart must operate the integration of technologies of electrical systems and ICT. They refer to a set of technologies (components communications) integrated into the electrical system and into the management strategies of this system complex. These new technologies must enable them to effectively integrate the actions of different users effective To contribute to the success of the energy transition be articulated around four axes modifying the current system of networks based on a management unidirectional from upstream to downstream through integrated management at several levels and bidirectional:  Integration of renewable energies  Flexibility of production and consumption for the reduction of the electrical peak;  Management of two-way information and energy flows between the three voltage levels - high tension  Management of capacities and cross-border flows in the interconnected European network. The integration of ICT into the world of electricity requires the provision of detailed data and the better in real time. In Luxembourg transposed by a legal obligation for the operators of the electricity (and gas) network to deploy such meters to 95% of end customers connected to their network by 2020. Since they will in particular provide the network manager with better knowledge of the state of the network and to bring new services and information to consumers intelligence are often considered the essential first stone for the development of smart networks. They are an essential link in order to be able to offer flexibility services in the electricity market integrated storage solution emerging energy sources (demand management 118 https://www.troisiemerevolutionindustrielle.lu/etude-strategique/ Towards climate neutrality in 2050 51 / 97 renewable emerging electric vehicles. The management of an intelligent network will also have to secure the massive integration of productions of renewable and variable energy major wind farms consumption at all voltage levels and guaranteeing stability and safety supply. These same challenges arise at the level of the electricity transmission network European and interconnected, in particular to transport large quantities of electricity produced in the North Sea to consumption centers located in central Europe. Smart grids are defined by their inevitable reliance on ICT. Gold major effort to be made consists in guaranteeing the IT security of these critical infrastructures by protect themselves as much as possible against possible computer attacks. On the other hand development and use of artificial intelligence can provide potential for optimization benefits of energy networks. Smart grids are essential instruments to support the decarbonization of the energy system. They are beneficial to the establishment of conditions promoting energy efficiency better control of new uses such as the integration of electric vehicles enable the optimization of networks and their management and aim to promote useful behaviors for the networks through more flexible pricing based on usage. the Luxembourg continues to compete in various European fora (Benelux pentalateral of energy the development and implementation of smart electricity networks. 6.2.6 Harnessing synergies through sector coupling The growing intelligence of energy networks will make it possible to gradually couple the systems which are now largely operated independently of each other. This coupling results by two main advantages: On the one hand judiciously exploiting the waste heat of the electricity production units in the networks of heat or by recovering the batteries of electric vehicles in the network through two-way charging terminals. On the other hand to replace natural gas with hydrogen produced from renewable energies. Energy electricity is of paramount importance for both effects easy to decarbonize wide variety of end uses (transport raison increase beyond 2030. At the same time by electricity. For this reason decarbonized alternative energy such as hydrogen industry and in the field of mobility. A large number of cross-sectoral interactions and couplings are possible. However time decarbonization. A wide variety of concepts are already being developed and should be implemented as pilot projects by 2030 electricity to the gas sector and the integration of the hydrogen energy carrier. By 2050 expect these – assuming technology availability and efficiency Towards climate neutrality in 2050 52 / 97 economic – will be ready for the market and will establish themselves as an elementary concept of the system. In this context declaration developed within the framework of the Pentalateral Energy Forum towards decarbonization full energy supply. Sector coupling also depends on data infrastructure and communication. The Internet energy will play an important role in the future development of services rational use of energy. Automated processes and smart algorithms that adapt to the respective influences of the user and the environment will make it possible to optimize more energy needs. A central element of the various processes and activities in the energy sector will be the national energy data platform easy way to access high quality data in near real time. Consumers finals of this platform to manage market processes more efficiently quality of service and develop new service models (particularly in the field of energy efficiency). Luxembourg’s “Data-Driven Innovation Strategy”119 plans to integrate the energy data platform in a cross-industry data exchange platform which makes it possible to link the data together via a coherent interface and to enhance them further better. These common data interfaces will represent an essential element of the coupling sector in Luxembourg. 119 Ministry of Economy sustainable economy in Luxembourg economy/artificial-intelligence/data-driven-innovation.html Towards climate neutrality in 2050 53 / 97 6.3 Buildings Despite the sustained economic and demographic growth of Luxembourg and the activities of resulting construction almost equaled that of 2005. In short total emissions growing overall living area downward trend high energy levels which have been able to significantly limit the emissions caused by new housing. Driven by economic growth experienced a significant increase in recent years. Given the observed and projected magnitude of new construction and a demolition rate comparatively high of 2050 will be very significant towards climate neutrality. The current housing stock nevertheless remains mainly characterized by buildings over 20 years old that do not meet high standards in terms of energy efficiency and whose heating is largely dominated by fossil fuels. He should also be mentioned that the average living area per capita is already relatively high in Luxembourg and continues to grow average number of people per household. In order to fully decarbonise its building stock by 2050 to act resolutely to ensure that in the short term any new residential building or non-residential no longer emits greenhouse gases and to urgently accelerate and considerably the renovation of the stock of existing buildings resulting in buildings with zero emissions. Any new construction must respect the level of performance of a near zero energy building (NZEB thus a power supply exclusively based on renewable energies. Similarly 2050 high energy efficiency or even near-zero energy consumption cooled only by renewable energy energy saving potential. At the same time buildings. It is indeed a question of decarbonizing buildings and ensuring their sustainability on the whole. of their life cycle acceptance by them. Construction and renovation must become sustainable in the sense including the use of environmentally friendly building materials a rational and circular use of resources and the progressive application of the principles of the circular economy. The criteria for a sustainable building also include health (e.g. a good indoor air quality without pollutants) maintenance of a pleasant indoor climate in summer) construction and high comfort of use. Well-implemented digital technologies in smart and connected buildings can contribute to this comfort heating equipment renewable energy and electromobility in smart energy networks. 120 See the chapter “Circular economy” Towards climate neutrality in 2050 54 / 97 Finally decarbonization housing stock targeted to harmonize the growing need for housing with construction of buildings with small footprints and to respond to the observed drop in the average number of persons per household is particularly encouraged at the neighborhood level. To address the urgent need for housing and given the shortage of affordable housing housing with municipalities aims to increase the supply of affordable and sustainable housing. The three primary objectives of the housing pact 2.0 (entry into force from 2021) are:  Increase in the supply of affordable (rental) and sustainable housing at municipal level;  Mobilization of existing land and residential potential at municipal level (land "Baulückenprogramm" and existing residential);  Improvement of residential quality. 6.3.1 Decarbonized new constructions Recognizing that the energy renovation of buildings poses a much greater challenge and taking into account the usual life cycles of buildings decarbonized in 2050 is to ensure that in the short term any new construction no longer emits GES. In order to reduce energy consumption and therefore the carbon footprint of buildings Luxembourg has introduced extensive requirements in terms of the energy performance of new constructions since 2008 for residential buildings and since 2010 for buildings functional. These requirements have therefore been reinforced on several occasions and have reached the level of performance of a Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) since 2017 for new residential buildings and from 2021 for new functional buildings. With latest revision (effective 2021) energy performance makes the use of fossil fuels practically impossible121 and thus leads to the design and construction of zero-carbon buildings. The heating of buildings must therefore be ensured from renewable energy sources. The heat pumps powered by renewable electricity are well suited to heating near-zero energy buildings and avoiding particulate emissions associated with small biomass boilers. Heating networks urban often offer a profitable alternative in the case of fairly dense neighborhoods. The heat (at high or low temperature (combined in the latter case with heat pumps)) can then come from biomass deep geothermal energy framework of the aforementioned revision makes it possible to visualize and value the overrun of the requirements in particular through the optimized use of renewable energy sources and in particular through the advanced integration of photovoltaic energy on buildings. The combination of facilities photovoltaic and electrical storage systems enables self-consumption and facilitates development of energy communities122. Heated by efficient heat pumps buildings can thus become net producers of electrical energy. It is right to further develop the concept of the building as an energy producer for positive energy neighborhoods. 121 As of 2023 122 See the chapter “Energy system” Towards climate neutrality in 2050 55 / 97 Gold it is not enough to optimize the energy performance of their use. It is therefore important to promote sustainable construction rational and circular resources carbon as well as taking into account all phases of a building’s life through construction and use to deconstruction. Strengthening the sustainable construction necessarily involves the introduction concepts residential than functional buildings. Luxembourg is required to analyze implement the most appropriate solutions National Council for Sustainable Construction123 could play a useful role. Currently a number of sustainable building certifications are available124 "Luxembourg Sustainability Certification" 125 for residential buildings. It should be noted that with a view to improving the resilience of buildings in the face of climate change construction standards should be adapted to new climatic conditions in particular the requirements in terms of summer thermal protection to face waves prolonged and acute heat without the use of energy-intensive air conditioning. Digitization is a key element in the intelligent management of buildings and their integration in the energy system. The digitization of buildings must therefore be further developed and regulated judiciously with the aim in particular of visualizing and optimizing consumption energy of a building smart management energy storage. In addition to the traditional functions of a building constructions is long. In order to respond appropriately to all these needs and to create decarbonized buildings innovation in the construction sector is sought and must be encouraged. A design and planning integrating the targeted dimensions and supported by advanced digital tools are essential and call for all the creativity of architects and engineers. Similarly researchers coveted solutions. In particular, the challenge is to cleverly combine sustainability with architectural quality ensure market and public acceptance. The gradual strengthening of the requirements for the energy performance of buildings and the various measures promoting sustainable construction in Luxembourg have enabled actors in the construction sector and complementary sectors to develop their skills in the matter we must intensify to support the sector and ensure the permanent development of skills and capacities required in all trades and at all levels. A pronounced shortage of labor being observed in the field of digital building technologies are to be developed. To address this lack of qualified skills 123 http://www.cncd.lu 124 BREEAM: www.breeam.com; DGNB: www.dgnb.de; HQE: www.behqe.com 125 https://logement.public.lu/fr/lenoz.html Towards climate neutrality by 2050 56 / 97 improve the attractiveness of jobs in the construction sector perception of these professions of the future and with high growth potential. The realization and communication of pilot and exemplary projects are essential to develop the skills of the speakers population that decarbonized and sustainable buildings are feasible at affordable prices and contribute to the comfort and well-being of users. In this sense consolidate their pioneering role. Note the exemplary neighborhood project "Elmen" (municipality of throats). Financial aid schemes are in place to promote the sustainability of new constructions photovoltaic. These plans must be updated regularly to take account of changes technological simple administration. The construction of sustainable housing is currently126 supported by the PRIMe House scheme (by reference to the LENOZ certification system) and certain programs communal. Municipalities are encouraged through the climate and energy fund127 (e.g. for the implementation of municipal heating networks based on renewable energies and heat fatale) protection of the environment128. Ultimately and flyers collaboration with the sector. Furthermore both in the design of a building and during its operation could contribute to make buildings more economical. 6.3.2 Deep and sustainable energy renovations With a view to a decarbonized building stock by 2050 will have to be transformed into buildings with very high energy efficiency or even energy consumption almost zero energy129 based on renewable energies. Knowing that the annual rate of renovation relating to buildings residential is estimated at around 0 dominated (about 90% of housing units) by fossil fuels130 energy and sustainability must increase significantly. In parallel must progress significantly make the best use of energy saving potentials and avoid the lock-in effect of unambitious renovations. While it is true that renovation still poses enormous challenges also great opportunities beyond decarbonization heating costs well-being for users 126 https://www.myenergy.lu/fr/particuliers/lois-et-reglements/soutien-financier 127 https://www.myenergy.lu/fr/communes/soutien-financier/vous-souhaitez-beneficier-d-une-aide-a-l- investment 128 https://guichet.public.lu/fr/entreprises/financement-aides/aides-environnement/industrie-services/aide- protect-environment.html 129 Improving the energy efficiency of the thermal envelope and technical equipment 130 Ministry of Energy and Regional Planning Luxembourg " 131 Amount of energy saved compared to the state of the building before the renovation Towards climate neutrality in 2050 57 / 97 local employment. Furthermore resilient to climate change and bicycle parking With the aim of supporting the renovation of the residential and non-residential building stock Luxembourg established in 2020 a long-term renovation strategy132 covering the period until 2050. This strategy includes a detailed overview of the building stock133 profitable renovation projects and an analysis of obstacles to renovation. Among the obstacles are mentioned in particular the low level of energy prices construction and further information deficits (e.g. in relation to the savings potential of the building) or economic (e.g. high and rapidly growing real estate prices). The prices of energy matters purchase From 2015 a broad participatory process with the help of all the actors concerned and resulting in guidelines for supporting energy renovation. The long-term renovation strategy is based on these guidelines and continues to reflect on them:  Priority to high energy efficiency renovation;  Accessibility134 to energy renovation measures;  Coordination between energy policy and heritage protection;  Integration of the dimensions of sustainable construction and the circular economy. In particular, it is confirmed that it is important to improve the profitability of energy renovations through financial and fiscal measures and that to the energy aspect of a renovation are to be taken into account. According to the long-term renovation strategy renovation are the implementation of a panoply of measures and tools and their perfect interaction so that their effects are mutually reinforcing. The measures identified relate to the framework regulatory; grant and funding instruments; fiscal instruments; the sensitization pilots. In the following additional supplements the strategy. At the level of the regulatory framework minimum requirements to be met in the case of substantial modifications and transformations of buildings are defined in the regulations on the energy performance of buildings. With the latest regulatory overhaul functional buildings and from 2023 for residential buildings. A regular review is required. As an alternative to a bond 132 Ministry of Energy and Regional Planning Luxembourg " 133 A complete analysis is presented for residential buildings urgent need to improve the availability of data on functional buildings in order to deepen analysis and development of measures on them. 134 In the sense of “Finanzierbarkeit” 135 See the long-term renovation strategy for all the details: https://mea.gouvernement.lu/dam- assets / energy / energy-efficiency / lu-ltrs-2020.pdf Towards climate neutrality by 2050 58 / 97 (i.e. roadmap for gradual and long-term renovation) is supposed to allow a better identification and visualization of potential savings and thus encourage the implementation of individual measures leading to complete renovations. To promote the renovation functional buildings mandatory energy is to be considered. With the aim of accelerating the deep renovation of buildings functional categories of functional buildings to be implemented within a sufficient period of time (eg. 10-15 years) condominiums in condominiums is in progress. The bill specifies that these works are decided by a majority of the votes of all the co-owners. It is also necessary to find a solution by relation to the conflicting interests between owners and tenants in the buildings proposed for rental. Ultimately climate goals are needed. In the absence of a renovation obligation and with a view to making the renovation profitable financial aid is in place to promote the sustainable energy renovation of buildings. Alongside the improvement of the thermal envelope (preferably by materials and ecological and circular insulation techniques) renewables and the integration of photovoltaic energy are financially supported. In order to accelerate the decarbonization of the building stock comprehensive and sustainable and in particular accelerate the abandonment of heating oil. The diets are to be updated regularly according to the results and to take into account the evolution technological simple administration. In the area of housing House interest rate called “climate loan interest grant” (making it accessible to all affected owners) energy suppliers under the Energy Efficiency Obligation Scheme as well as tax incentives. The renovation of municipal buildings is promoted through the climate and energy fund137 renovation consultants. Companies are supported in particular by aid for investment in favor of environmental protection. In fgeneral ensure sufficient funding innovative financing. To ensure that energy prices send the right signals on energy efficiency taxation of fossil fuels and predictably be revised upwards. A first step is taken with the introduction from 2021 of a CO tax set at 20 euros per tonne of CO 139. The gradual increase in the tax will 2 2 accelerate the return on renovation measures. 136 https://www.myenergy.lu/fr/particuliers/lois-et-reglements/soutien-financier 137 https://www.myenergy.lu/fr/communes/soutien-financier/vous-souhaitez-beneficier-d-une-aide-a-l- investment 138 https://guichet.public.lu/fr/entreprises/financement-aides/aides-environnement/industrie-services/aide- protect-environment.html 139 See the chapter “Tax Policy: Providing the Necessary Incentives” Towards climate neutrality in 2050 59 / 97 The long-term renovation strategy140 suggests that in Luxembourg payment of the energy bill is not linked to the price of energy relative to household disposable income. Like the energy renovation of a home reduces the energy bill to use renovation as a lever to fight against fuel poverty and promote access safe and affordable housing for all households. Renovation works being labor intensive services at the local level. Gold appreciable in the construction sector the desired increase in renovation activities. This results in the urgency of attracting capacities additional in the construction sector and also through vocational retraining. To achieve the sustainable renovations in the desired quality necessary qualifications and skills architects a prerequisite for high-quality renovation projects that motivate homeowners to take action. Pilot and exemplary projects (in particular deep and sustainable renovation of buildings functional or residential neighborhoods) are essential for developing the skills of stakeholders and convince the sector are achievable at affordable prices. The State and the municipalities must consolidate their role precursor. To be cited in this context public promoters exemplary way their rental portfolio and in particular social housing. The renovation strategy also mentions that the lack of information remains a barrier to renovation. Additional actions therefore necessary to further improve awareness sustainable energy renovation renovation. Beyond renovation aimed at encouraging users of residential and functional buildings to exploit the potential not negligible energy savings at the level of building operation in general and at the level behavior in particular. 6.3.3 Positive energy neighborhoods Grouping buildings together within a neighborhood143 often has the potential to achieve more efficient to low-carbon or even positive-energy neighborhoods. First of all into larger assemblies allows for economies of scale and faster production activities. renovation. Next of waste heat combined with appropriate energy storage can decarbonize cooling systems. heating and electricity supply and even lead to a surplus of electrical energy. 140 Ministry of Energy and Regional Planning Luxembourg " 141 Ministry of Energy and Regional Planning Luxembourg " 142 See the Build Up Skills and LuxBuild initiatives: https://www.myenergy.lu/fr/experts/luxbuild2020 143 See also the chapter “Exploiting the coordinating function of territorial and urban planning” Towards climate neutrality in 2050 60 / 97 The neighborhood also offers an ideal platform for sharing resources form of energy communities or community gardens citizen participation. Conversely sustainable neighborhood development. Public promoters (municipalities the development of diversified eco-districts daily high quality of life. These qualities are implemented in the current flagship projects carried out by public promoters: “Elmen” (municipality of Kehlen) (municipality of Dudelange). Furthermore municipalities are intensified in order to carry out or facilitate exemplary renovations of villages and existing residential areas. Densification can be implemented as part of redevelopment of localities. A densification of the housing stock can be favored at the level of development plans municipal offices by adjusting the coefficients relating to the density of housing and the coefficient land use in strategic locations territorial planning. This densification can be carried out:  At the level of general development plans;  At the level of specific development plans (e.g. adaptation of typologies of housing as needed  At the level of PAP-QE (special development plans – existing districts) and building regulations (e.g. adjustment of the minimum usable area per dwelling per in relation to the real and reasonable needs of households On the other hand and existing neighborhoods could combine energy renovation and densification with the creation of integrated housing (“Einliegerwohnung”) during an energy renovation depth of an existing single-family home. To improve resilience to climate change measures against heat islands when designing new neighborhoods. The choice of materials taken into account when designing buildings can reduce heat build-up during of heat wave. Towards climate neutrality in 2050 61 / 97 6.4 Mobility Around 57% in 2019144 road transport. That same year the export of fuels145 Western Europe transit routes neighboring countries and the high proportion of cross-border workers. A continual and consequent drop in the sale of fuels to non-residents essential in order to conform the emissions of the "transport" sector to a trajectory compatible with climate goals. On a national level neighboring countries imposes itself by adjusting the taxation of fuels carbon146. Given the cross-border and European dimension of transport strengthen and develop regional and European solutions vehicle performance cross-border and European or decarbonisation of freight transport. Or registered in Luxembourg continued to increase until 2019 dynamic demographic and economic characterized by high specific CO emissions compared to the European average and a 2 high ratio of vehicles per capita. To achieve climate neutrality by 2050 to do everything possible to decarbonise the mobility system. The efforts to be made will be very substantial better air quality accidents or even a reduction or even the elimination of storage capacities for products tankers citizens. Although it is imperative that prices reflect the real costs147 of the different modes of transport in particular through an appropriate tax policy vehicles habits in terms of mobility are paramount. First of all territorial and urban which succeeds in reducing mobility needs despite the growth projected demographic. A judicious reconciliation of housing functions supplies and leisure allows citizens to shorten their journeys148. The progressive digitization of the economy gives a growing number of workers and organizations the possibility of using telework149. It is therefore a question of extending this working method optimally and thus benefit from the considerable potential for reducing commuter traffic and professional. Similarly especially in border areas 144 Approximately 67% of total GHG emissions excluding ETS 145 Sold to vehicles registered abroad. 146 See the chapter “Fiscal policy: providing the necessary incentives” 147 By internalizing costs related to the environment 148 See the chapter “Exploiting the coordinating function of territorial and urban planning” 149 See the chapter “Mobilizing research and promoting innovation and digitalisation” Towards climate neutrality by 2050 62 / 97 In order to eliminate GHG emissions resulting from mobility needs modal shares of active mobility and public transport through mobility planning appropriate and accelerate the deployment of zero-emission vehicles. 6.4.1 Mobility planning promoting public transport and active mobility According to the 2017 Luxmobil survey public transport in a perspective of fluid mobility than decarbonized mobility must, as a matter of priority, pursue the objective of increasing the modal shares of active mobility and public transport to the detriment of the modal share of the car multimodality150 of the mobility network. Based on the strategy for sustainable mobility Modu 2.0151 2035 is being developed and will aim to put in place the required measures and infrastructure for sustainable mobility in all regions of the country cross-border. This plan will be updated every five years. In order to convince a growing number of people to use public transport to walk compared to the car by investing preferentially in the related infrastructure. Regarding active mobility create safe and friendly spaces for pedestrians and cyclists construction of dedicated cycle paths adapted to the needs of daily mobility and related infrastructure such as secure bicycle parking. Thereby more than double the length of the national network of cycle paths within a few years serving major points of interest such as railway stations or generating poles jobs dangerous points. In parallel the bicycle must be promoted more actively as a solution for daily mobility. Improving the attractiveness of public transport essentially involves reducing travel times. competitive journeys and punctuality communication of real-time information and welcoming stops/stations and interchanges as well as the increase in capacity and the multimodal extension of the mobility network. To relieve what of Luxembourg. Extensive investment programs in rail transport euros and counting in relative terms among the most ambitious in Europe 4 billion euros committed for the period from 2013 to 2025 are invested in the extension and modernization of infrastructure (new lines and the purchase of rolling stock also contributes to the financing of infrastructure or operating projects in the territories neighboring countries to improve cross-border mobility for the many workers border. Furthermore of Luxembourg is under construction. After the commissioning of a first section of line 150 Multimodality is the combination of several modes of transport for the same trip. 151 Ministry of Sustainable Development and Infrastructure durable Towards climate neutrality in 2050 63 / 97 complete plant followed at the end of 2020 concerns the RGTR152 bus network serving all the municipalities of the country and connecting localities of the 3 neighboring countries with urban centers in Luxembourg gradually implemented until 2021 based on close collaboration with the municipalities and the citizens. It should be noted that the RGTR concession contracts contain incentives and requirements at the operating level (control and optimization of consumption or training in eco-driving) and rolling stock. Following positive feedback with electric buses153 the coalition agreement provides for the objective of achieving zero emissions on the RGTR network by 2030154. In this context operators are supplied exclusively with electricity from renewable sources. Building on these accomplishments quality of the mobility network must be continued or even intensified in the medium and long term in the framework of the aforementioned national mobility plan. Alongside continuous network optimization railway (for example express tram between Luxembourg-Ville and Esch-sur-Alzette) level of organization and infrastructure of the bus network as well as the increased facilitation of intermodal exchange are to be targeted. An amplified cross-border/European cooperation is by elsewhere necessary to create a trans-European network that would allow high-speed rail speed a real alternative to the car or the plane for travel in Europe Multimodal mobility play an increasingly important role in moving towards decarbonised mobility. rendered possible by digitization automated in all modes of transport can make mobility smoother and cleaner. He It is therefore important to support the digitization of mobility and to create a favorable framework for the development and implementation of innovative mobility services (“mobility-as-a-service”) such as digital applications (in particular a digital platform bringing together all the transport modes/services with real-time information) (electric) and bicycles or even carpooling155. 6.4.2 Accelerated deployment of zero-emission vehicles The decarbonisation of the mobility system also requires low-emission vehicles and it is ultimately dependent on a large-scale or even complete deployment of vehicles with zero emissions. In this context CO emissions for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles as well as 2 for heavy goods vehicles needs to be further strengthened with the aim of defining a clear trajectory towards a zero-emission road transport. Obviously and technological innovation must progress at European and global level so as to make 152 General Road Transport Regime 153 In September 2020 electrical. (Source: Ministry of Mobility and Public Works 154 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 as the objective of achieving zero emissions on the regional bus network of the General Transport Regime (RGTR) in 2030”. 155 As part of the 2017 Luxmobil survey of about 1 through carpooling would help reduce the number of cars on the roads. Towards climate neutrality in 2050 64 / 97 possible this transition. Besides optimization potential offered by the connectivity and autonomous driving of vehicles by putting put in place the required infrastructural and legal framework. While acknowledging that given current knowledge and available technologies electromobility powered by renewable energies alone is not necessarily the solution for all types of vehicles electrification of almost half of the vehicle fleet by 2030. Indeed PNEC corresponds to a 49% share of electric vehicles (all-electric and plug-in hybrid) of the car fleet in 2030156. The distribution of electric vehicles in Luxembourg depends heard of the more or less rapid evolution of the international automotive market national measures to promote and establish adequate charging infrastructure. The mission is to achieve full decarbonization of the national vehicle fleet by the horizon 2050. Luxembourg has opted for the development of a common national infrastructure of terminals public charging for electric vehicles157. The expected increase in these vehicles must be continuously accompanied by an increasingly dense network of public charging points The success of electromobility also depends on the ease of charging an electric vehicle. The information on the location of a terminal recharging must be made available to users and payment must be easy. Setting installation of a fast-charging infrastructure is also crucial to allow long journeys distance. Cross-border collaboration within a European framework is essential to ensure Interconnected and seamless cross-border charging services. In this regard the Benelux initiative for a single area of electromobility aimed at facilitating electric vehicle drivers that 95% of charging operations are carried out at private charging points (at home and/or at work) be able to charge electric vehicles in a timely manner. that's why in accordance with the law so that a charging device for electric vehicles can subsequently be accommodated in the case of new buildings and in the case of redevelopment of infrastructure related to buildings existing. For certain apartment buildings, the installation of a collective management system smart charging is required. And minimum requirements are introduced regarding the installation charging points for some functional buildings with more than 10 charging slots parking some buildings having more than 20 slots. Longer term bidirectional charging will be able to recover the batteries of electric vehicles as storage integrated into smart grids. In view of compatibility with the primary objective of the decarbonization of the mobility system from renewable energy sources for any type of charging. 156 End of August 2020 gradual increase in new registrations observed over the past 3 years (approximately 7 August). (Source: Ministry of Mobility and Public Works 157 In a first phase nearing completion 1,600 charging points public charges existed at the end of 2019. (Source: Ministry of Mobility and Public Works Towards climate neutrality in 2050 65 / 97 With the aim of promoting electromobility encourage the purchase or ownership of electric vehicles as a replacement or to the detriment of internal combustion vehicles through appropriate purchase bonuses158 favourable159 and more financial aid for private charging stations160. In the concern of keep refueling costs lower than those of thermal vehicles161 to ensure advantageous charging prices. Additional incentives to consider consist of the right to park for free in paid public spaces or to benefit from free public charging stations. Governments should lead by example by electrifying their own vehicle fleets or imposing electric vehicles through public service contracts. Since 2018 state service or executive cars in very exceptional cases on the basis of detailed justification162. In parallel cars and light commercial vehicles distribution of goods or home care The deployment of electromobility also depends on the technological development of batteries. Intensified research and innovation efforts are needed globally to improve the performance and durability of this key component of electric vehicles. In the current state technology is not ready to power all types of vehicles heavy. Given that uncertainties remain regarding the further development consider additional alternatives. The government pursues a policy technologically neutral with regard to alternative fuels insofar as the technology can contribute to making road transport cleaner in terms of GHG emissions and atmospheric pollutants. Especially for heavy duty vehicles biofuels or biogas but also renewable hydrogen and synthetic fuels renewables can play a role decarbonized163. Although significant advances in the production of decarbonized fuels and fuel cell or hydrogen powered vehicles are required synthetic fuels produced by converting renewable electricity could become competitive in the medium to long term and offer advantages in terms of autonomy. Short term the installation of at least one hydrogen supply station is planned in Luxembourg. If renewable hydrogen was confirmed as a viable solution refueling should see the light of day deserves to be used in conventional engines and distributed throughout the system existing fuel supply. 158 www.cleverfueren.lu 159 See the chapter “Fiscal policy: providing the necessary incentives” 160 www.cleverlueden.lu 161 It should be noted that electric vehicles generally have lower maintenance costs than thermal vehicles. 162 Directive (EU) 2019/1161 on the promotion of clean and fuel-efficient road transport vehicles in fixed energy for Luxembourg a rate of 38 clean light in public tenders. 163 See also the chapter “Energy system – About the potential role of hydrogen” 164 Like electric vehicles renewable hydrogen are eligible for the purchase bonus and can benefit from advantageous taxation cars. Towards climate neutrality in 2050 66 / 97 The rate of biofuels mixed with fossil fuels has continuously increased over the Luxembourg for about ten years to reach 7 environmental impacts and reduce the risk of inducing land use changes through production of biofuels gradually introduced. Thereby waste should gradually grow. At the same time, the share of agro-food biofuels will decrease. Unless new raw materials such as land-grown seaweed become competitive for the production of biofuels advanced and sustainable biofuels limited by the availability of raw materials. The PNEC account with a biofuel blending rate of 10% in 2030. The market share of biogas as fuel remains marginal in Luxembourg166. As at present, a number of technological uncertainties persist will keep a technological openness and will closely follow the evolution in terms of vehicles from zero emissions. 6.4.3 Decarbonizing freight transport and the logistics sector Economic growth and also the significant expansion of e-commerce support growing demand for freight transport. Strong and concerted actions will therefore be essential to decarbonize the transport and distribution of goods. In particular the opinion sector of the Economic and Social Council167 recommends in this context that "if Luxembourg wants to achieve “CO free” urban logistics by 2030 [i.e. decarbonized] 2 take more restrictive measures. Alongside a logistics sector covering the needs national a logistics center that serves international markets and that it promotes as part of its policy of economic diversification. With the aim of reducing the carbon footprint of freight transport main fields of action to pursue and materialize in a decarbonization strategy at established in cooperation with the sector169 include:  Concerning the distribution of goods and the logistics of the last kilometer ("last mile”): promoting clean vehicles light commercial vehicles or cargo bikes; establishment of low/zero zones emissions; consolidation of goods in one or more distribution centers to allow a fine distribution capable of increasing the filling rate of vehicles and reduce movement; etc ;  Concerning the transport of goods at medium or long distance and the export of goods: promote modal shift towards modes of transport with low 165 The share of 2nd generation biofuels amounts to 50% of all biofuels made available consumption in Luxembourg in 2020. The limit for the use of agro-food biofuels is currently capped at 5%. 166 In 2019 167 Economic and Social Council Luxembourg – medium and long-term sectoral economic outlook with a view to sustainability (p. 57) 168 As part of the “Last Mile Delivery” project launched in 2014, it was found that the logistics of the last kilometer (“last mile”) was responsible for 20% of traffic in the urban areas of Luxembourg City and from Esch-sur-Alzette electronic. 169 In particular the Cluster for Logistics: https://www.clusterforlogistics.lu/ Towards climate neutrality by 2050 67 / 97 carbon intensity such as rail and waterways and continue to strengthen the multimodal freight transport Bettembourg / Dudelange and the tri-modal site of the port of Mertert which should facilitate more efficient management and an increase in track capacity rail and river; according to the technological evolution of utility vehicles heavy (electricity  Leverage digitalization to amplify the use of intelligent management systems the logistics chain;  Promote and expand programs to encourage businesses and the research sector logistics to reduce their carbon footprint  Adapt charges and taxes to take into account infrastructure costs and negative externalities of the Benelux the introduction of a system based on mileage (replacing the system Eurovignette). 6.4.4 Air and maritime sectors At European and global level GHG emissions activities. Given the international nature of these sectors European or even global scale. In order to include negative externalities in the prices of these means of transport and forcing technological innovation to significantly reduce the carbon and environmental footprint (in particular through the development of hydrogen renewable or renewable synthetic fuels) adequate emissions. Several measures can contribute to this effect: strengthen the segment of intra-European aviation in the EU GHG emissions trading scheme put in place a system for trading GHG emission quotas for international aviation through the CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) scheme in the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organization and revise the taxation of ships flying Luxembourg flag (registration tax) under the “Green Shipping” concept 170 https://transports.public.lu/fr/fret/transports-multimodaux/green-logistics/lean-and-green.html Towards climate neutrality in 2050 68 / 97 6.5 Economy in 2019 of GHGs in Luxembourg which resulted on the one hand from industrial energy consumption and on the other hand industrial processes. Nearly 80% of these emissions were subject to the system EU GHG emission allowance trading system and were produced by around 20 installations industrial. Over the period from 2005 to 2019 12% although some stagnation has been observed in recent years. Note that approximately 40% of building emissions (responsible in 2019 for 15 to tertiary buildings, which nevertheless experienced an upward trend in their emissions due to strong construction activity in recent years171. Achieving climate neutrality implies a profound transformation of the economy in general and industry in particular. The transition is underway globally and it comes with challenges considerable commerce global instead of having it later. Only economic and industrial development compatible with momentum of the ongoing transition will be able to preserve or even improve the country's long-term competitiveness. term. It therefore seems appropriate to exploit the transition in an intelligent way to deploy a economic172 and industrial development strategy likely to advance the modernization of the industrial fabric value providing zero/low carbon solutions best possible from stranded assets quality. In this sense necessary to both reduce their own carbon footprint and contribute to decarbonization of the country through their products and services. The decarbonization of industry requires a fundamental transformation of supply chains. production important transition in the industry. Strengthening the circular economy and resource efficiency is a decisiveness in the way forward to identify and implement zero/low solutions carbon. It is a question of transforming the economy which remains largely “linear” (therefore dependent on a flow new materials extracted waste or emissions) in a circular economy and innovative business initiatives promoting the rational use of resources. Furthermore dynamics of decarbonization of construction markets take full advantage of the transition to innovate and adapt the products and services offered with agility develop new niches in terms of eco-innovation and eco-technologies and seize the related economic opportunities implies strong public support solved and the mobilization of the entire innovation system173. In  fine specifically with regard to zero carbon solutions. in parallel 171 See the chapter “Buildings” 172 See the chapter “Sustainable finance” for the financial sector 173 See also the chapter “Mobilizing research and promoting innovation and digitalisation” Towards climate neutrality in 2050 69 / 97 strengthen promoting the implementation of decarbonization technologies in industry efforts of industrial players. In addition to the essential circular economy following apps matter promising:  In compliance with the principle of primacy of energy efficiency (compared to energy supply) optimally. Specifically as enabling technologies to improve the efficiency of production processes (Industry 4.0) digital itself.  Significant decarbonization capabilities rely on direct electrification or indirect industrial processes renewable electricity. Indirect electrification (for processes that are difficult to electrify in particular certain industrial processes requiring very high temperatures or reducing source) requires the substitution of process gases with the hydrogen produced based on renewable electricity.  To minimize its carbon footprint enough renewable energy at competitive prices. In thermal processes difficult to electrify fossil fuels can replaced by sustainable biomass or renewable hydrogen.  In the absence of adequate technologies industrial production will be difficult to eliminate. In such cases carbon175 can possibly be a last option towards neutrality climatic. At the current state of technology can be avoided or remain difficult to avoid. In order to push decarbonization as far as possible possible supported in cooperation with European partners in the priority areas to be defined especially in carbon-intensive sectors the glass industry Obviously also be accompanied by appropriate investments in enabling infrastructure namely smart grids or even renewable hydrogen. In order to guarantee an adequate supply of renewable energy there is also a need to further boost the expansion of solar and wind energy as well as storage capacities and stepping up European cooperation in this area176. All in all and to the image of mobility investment program to finance enabling infrastructure zero/low carbon solutions and promote research 174 See also the chapter “Energy system – About the potential role of renewable hydrogen” 175 Carbon capture and use in industry refers to processes in which CO is released 2 captured and then converted into a new product. Synthetic fuels are an example where CO 2 is released a second time during their combustion. Other products exist and building materials 2 176 See the chapter “Energy system” Towards climate neutrality in 2050 70 / 97 relatively long industry investment and development cycles transformation must start now. Despite the difficult economic situation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic investments capable of accelerating the transition to climate neutrality. With the aim of identifying and implementing the most promising decarbonization avenues competent ministries have a strategy for the decarbonization of industrial processes carried out by close collaboration with stakeholders. A range of measures and instruments promoting in particular the energy efficiency of industrial and other companies involved in their decarbonization efforts  The Energy Efficiency Obligation Scheme177 reinforced for a second period from 2021 to 2030 of natural gas to encourage consumers to reduce their energy consumption by implementation of energy efficiency measures. Eligible measures are typically measures related to the energy renovation of buildings and efficiency projects energy in business energy savings. Direct contact between companies energy suppliers provides advice and assistance tailored to the specific needs and in this way facilitates the identification and implementation of projects.  Through the Voluntary Agreement on Improving Energy Efficiency in Industry luxembourgeoise178 large energy consumers) undertake to save energy put in place effective energy management and to follow training in efficiency energy the achievement of the energy efficiency objectives set. A first agreement was concluded in 1996. A new period with deepened and strengthened provisions begins in 2021.  Since 2016 energy periodically every four years179. The energy audit can be carried out within the framework of an energy management system (e.g. ISO 50001) or the environment (e.g. ISO 14001) accelerate the implementation of the measures identified containing the results of the energy audits and thus facilitating contact between actors is planned.  Under EU framework respectful of the environment or innovation can benefit from aid specific180. This particularly concerns investments in favor of measures energy efficiency efficient heating and cooling networks energy infrastructure. A revision of the EU aid guidelines 177 https://www.myenergy.lu/fr/particuliers/lois-et-reglements/mecanisme-d-obligations; see also chapter “Energy system – Energy efficiency” 178 https://www.myenergy.lu/fr/entreprises/grandes-entreprises-et-industries/accord-volontaire-fedil 179 https://www.myenergy.lu/fr/entreprises/grandes-entreprises-et-industries/les-audits-energetiques 180 https://guichet.public.lu/fr/entreprises/financement-aides/aides-environnement/industrie-services/aide- protect-environment.html Towards climate neutrality in 2050 71 / 97 is needed businesses.  Note also two tools developed at European level aimed at improving the footprint environmentally friendly in general (Environmental Management and Audit Scheme) and the European Ecolabel182. The experience of the bond mechanism clearly illustrates the usefulness of leveraging synergies possible between the various instruments available to amplify the reduction in corporate GHG emissions. Alongside the strengthening of instruments make it more easily accessible to companies and more effective in terms of their incentive effects respective. Based on regular assessments and in-depth analyzes a complete and balanced array of instruments supplemented by new tools. In this sense mentioned:  Experience has shown that there is a significant gap between savings opportunities of energy revealed by the audits and those implemented by the industry or the owners of large office buildings. Many potential investments audits deficit risk management (“de-risking”) to facilitate the execution of decarbonization projects industry and SMEs in close cooperation with the European Bank investment183.  Based on good experiences with the climate pact with municipalities and taking into account similar instruments dedicated to companies in other European countries coalition 2018-2023 provides for the creation of an accompaniment and support instrument integrated for SMEs184. Such an instrument could provide the support needed to guide SMEs in particular through the creation of business networks and the exploitation of the potential for synergies within economic activity zones. 6.5.1 Circular economy In a circular economy (CE) creation of socio-economic value is based on holistic management of stocks and flows of materials crucial challenges related to the availability and distribution of key resources for the economy at the level global current production and consumption natural and human heritage. CE has thus become the common thread for many policies aimed at the sustainable management of our resources at the same time as creating socio-economic value. Generally 181 https://ec.europa.eu/environment/emas/index_en.htm 182 https://environnement.public.lu/fr/emweltprozeduren/Aides/Label_ecologique.html 183 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 184 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 Towards climate neutrality in 2050 72 / 97 the EC is considered as a key instrument to achieve a significant number of objectives of the sustainable development (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda European Commission's Green Economy following the COVID-19 pandemic puts the EC at the center strategies to adopt. It should be noted that in March 2020 the Commission presented a “new plan of action for the circular economy”185. On a national level Strategy «Zero Waste Luxembourg» 186. The tools and courses of action proposed in this strategy for a more sustainable management of stocks and material flow in the circular economy strategy for Luxembourg “Strategie Circular Economy Luxembourg »187. The strategy has been developed jointly by four ministries188 which cover with their respective fields of action crucial stages of the value chain economics of products and services until the material value is recovered in loops. It offers a toolbox and a methodology with regulatory measures implement CE in key sectors and themes that are (in alphabetical order) food and biobased materials finance and industry. In effect fuels in the production of electricity and heat are combined with measures to reduce the energy intensity of stocks and flows of materials. Studies indicate that an implementation of CE in steel value chains can contribute more than 50% in reducing the energy needs of these sectors of industry heavy189. These gains can be made products and components throughout their useful life as well as recovery consequent raw materials “product as a service”190. Applications of these principles are currently already practiced in niches or are beginning to emerge. In Luxembourg “Fit4Circularity”191 and “Fit4resilience”192. The implementation of these concepts, however, requires to fundamentally rethink business management and accounting models Ministries of Economy and Finance are investigating ways to support these companies of systemically through the Luxembourg financial ecosystem 185 Communication from the European Commission (COM(2020) 98 final): A new action plan for a circular economy – For a cleaner and more competitive Europe 186 MECDD resources / null-waste-letzebuerg.html 187 MEA Kreeslafwirtschaft Lëtzebuerg » February/08-circular-economy-strategy/20210208-Circular-economy-strategy-Luxembourg.pdf 188 Ministry of Energy and Regional Planning the environment 189 Studies conducted by the Swedish consultant “Material Economics” in close collaboration with other institute. 190 See also the chapter “New business models” 191 https://www.luxinnovation.lu/fr/fit-4-circularity/ 192 https://www.luxinnovation.lu/fr/fit-4-resilience/ Towards climate neutrality in 2050 73 / 97 European green193. Another crucial vector of support is the information technologies of the communication products “Product Circularity Data Set”194 which offers new tools and services for managing transparent and secure inventory and product flow national and international. Without forgetting the eco-labeling of products and services through the European eco-label life cycle. In order to achieve the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 in key economic sectors through more efficient use of resources. Controlled value chains are to be implemented place to close loops for key products and materials (especially steel) (food Luxembourg industries to position themselves internationally and build resilient industrial ecosystems. The service and finance sector is called upon to offer a substantial support to these companies and to position themselves as a center of excellence in circular economy The main fields of action and strategic measures to be implemented are described in the Luxembourg EC strategy: regulatory framework; conducive financial environment; sensitization continuing education and training; research the strategy it is important to set ambitious objectives for each of the aforementioned sectors and to activate synergies between the different roadmaps Another key element is the development and application of circular indicators carbon footprint and life cycle analysis tools particular importance also goes to cross-border regional cooperation value chains extending over several hundred kilometers such as low-carbon cement or biobased materials (for construction and the chemical industry). Close synergies will be ensured with other sectoral and cross-functional strategies Innovation Strategy” and the “Luxembourg Sustainable Finance Strategy” to create a favorable framework EC and develop the skills of the sectors concerned for new economic activities durable. 6.5.2 Eco-innovation and eco-technologies As illustrated throughout this long-term strategy innovation and eco-technologies carbon sustainability are megatrends challenging the corporate world. Gold accept the challenge and embark on eco-innovation and the development of activities and solutions durable these opportunities certainly require reflection and efforts potentially affecting all the dimensions of a company’s strategy and model:  In which fields of activity does the company wish and can it be active? 193 See also the chapter “Sustainable finance” 194 www.circularitydataset.lu 195 See the chapter “Sustainable finance” Towards climate neutrality in 2050 74 / 97  In which markets does the company want to and can it be active?  How and where to produce?  What staff is available and what basic and ongoing training is required?  What can the company itself do and with which partners can and does it want to cooperate?  How to design and develop the supply chain?  How to go from pure shareholder value (interests exclusively of owners) ("shareholder value") to a more complete value for all stakeholders (employees (« stakeholder value ») ? By reflecting these strategic issues in relation to the various sectors of actions present themselves to companies. In terms of production energy consumption and energy saving offer themselves as a basis for business models. In the field of sustainable construction and energy renovation of buildings for all construction trades that the architects areas of activity are opening up to companies in the circular economy and the rational use of resources. In the mobility sector example by offering mobility services (“mobility-as-a-service”) intelligent mobility management systems bicycles or carpooling. Bike and outdoor equipment stores benefit from the progress of active mobility. In the field of agriculture and forestry regional and employment agricultural products from sustainable agriculture development of regional and seasonal cuisine as a brand (also promotion tourism) appropriate financing of ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. In order to take full advantage of this panoply of opportunities and thus diversify its structure economic eco-innovation and entrepreneurship by ensuring an appropriate facilitating framework. SMEs and start-ups ups being key players in innovation entrepreneurial spirit and create favorable framework conditions for business start-ups and social. In this context are useful to support start-ups in a non-bureaucratic way. Also note the “Fit for Start” and “Fit for Innovation”198 programs as well as state aid in favor of the research Luxembourg CleanTech Cluster200 consolidate their role. On this subject 196 https://www.host.lu/ 197 https://www.houseofentrepreneurship.lu/ 198 http://www.innovation.public.lu/fr/index.html 199 https://guichet.public.lu/fr/entreprises/financement-aides.html 200 https://www.luxinnovation.lu/cluster/luxembourg-cleantech-cluster/ Towards climate neutrality in 2050 75 / 97 Grand Duchy of Luxembourg”201 recommends the development of an acceleration program for start-ups whose vision is to create products and services that reduce the footprint carbon and increase other environmental benefits. She mentions that "Luxembourg should focus on creating an entrepreneurial ecosystem in which the public and private sectors work hand in hand to facilitate and support the emergence of sustainable products and services through the creation and development of start-ups”. 6.5.3 Business models One of the major problems of the current structure of the economy negatively impacting the environment resides in the specialization and fragmentation of activities and responsibilities along value chains. Although highly integrated and dependent on these value chains pressure on prices at all levels makes companies optimize their segment to the best of their ability to maximum profitability More holistic management concepts are needed to better control these impacts. At Luxembourg corporate social202. Other tools focusing more on environmental impacts are environmental management systems Audit Scheme) and ISO 14001 European Despite the measurable benefits of these initiatives linear functioning of the "produce-consume-throw away" of our society excessive consumption and waste of resources at all levels of the value chain. Supported by digitalization more sustainable management of our stocks and material flows of these stocks and flows eco conception ; repairable product maintenance loops and life extension utility; sharing and transfer of high quality products; product recovery and materials in the production chains. A business model that promotes these approaches is that of the “product as a service” which encourages the producer to remain the owner of the product and to offer a service. By recovering and reusing products the company also recovers the material value and in particular the embodied energy contained. Those approaches therefore make it possible to reduce the basic carbon footprint of physical stocks and flows. Some Luxembourg companies are already embarking on such concepts, supported by the financial and administrative ecosystem (e.g. removable and convertible car parks or outdoor flooring leasing concept). As a result renting/leasing and sharing of goods and services (“sharing economy”) can bring valuable contribution to the transformation of the economy. Similarly economic cooperative consumers. 201 https://www.troisiemerevolutionindustrielle.lu/etude-strategique/ 202 Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is based on a voluntary approach which consists of a responsible behavior towards economic actors matches the application between business and society. (Source: www.guichet.lu) Towards climate neutrality in 2050 76 / 97 The application of circularity indicators including the carbon footprint helps to stimulate business models of the "product as a service" type and must gradually become the standard to guide the investment and development choices of companies as well as the consumer/user choice. A transparent display of information « product circularity data sets » and consumers/users. An ecosystem of adapted digital and financial services must support new business models Regarding global supply chains and avoid possible environmental damage and human rights violations at the level global. Businesses that operate transnationally are called upon to take their responsibility for the impacts of their activities and business relationships. As provided for in the 2018-2023 coalition agreement to legislate on due diligence for companies based in Luxembourg. In response to the requests, among others, expressed by Luxembourg forthcoming publication of a draft directive establishing a duty of care at European level. The approach requires companies to establish appropriate procedures to identify their potential and actual negative impacts and take appropriate measures to avoid even offset these impacts a bill to put in place national structures and procedures in order to be able to ensure the effective application of the (EU) regulation on conflict minerals204.

In order to minimize the environmental footprint and global food climate  Ensure sustainable food production  Neutralize the environmental impact of processing storage and packaging) and marketing of foodstuffs: sustainable processing and storage processes; supply chains shortened; packaging limited to the minimum necessary food sector assumes responsibility for availability and price affordable healthy and sustainable food choices; increasing marketing of products organic  Promoting healthy and sustainable diets: healthy and sustainable diets sustainability favored by tax and regulatory provisions; consumers better informed about the nutritional value and ecological footprint of foodstuffs (a.a. by labelling); nutrition counseling encourages a balanced diet and less meat-intensive; switching to a more plant-based and healthier diet reduces also the environmental impact; public collective catering assumes its role as precursor;  Reduce food losses and waste: the "Null Offall Lëtzebuerg" strategy 207 and the “Anti Gaspi” campaign208 present roadmaps for better promoting food and reduce food loss and waste; revision of EU rules on dates (“to be consumed until” and “to be consumed preferably before”) mentioned on the food. The transition to sustainable food also requires a collective approach involving all actors in the supply chain. food value Public powers. Next to consumers and merchants key in transition management. It will be necessary to ensure that the transition is fair for the primary producers promoting social and environmental benefit. This includes generating higher returns fair in the value chain region of agricultural products from sustainable agriculture resilient has a positive influence on the added value of primary production and must therefore be stimulated any further. Furthermore more sustainable food. 205 The European Commission published in May 2020 the communication COM(2020) 381 final: A strategy “From farm to table” for a fair food system 206 MECDD resources / null-waste-letzebuerg.html 207 MECDD 208 https://antigaspi.lu 209 Neobuild Towards climate neutrality in 2050 78 / 97 The common agricultural policy (CAP) and its implementation at national level must support the farmers to improve their environmental and climatic performance in line with the goal of climate neutrality by 2050 sustainable agricultural investments and practices and by the gradual strengthening of standards mandatory environmental. CAP funds are to be reallocated to activities and measures promoting the transition of agricultural production. In this context the implementation of the CAP must fully reflect medium and long-term climate ambitions. Agriculture is both an actor in climate change and impacted by its effects. Firstly 4 livestock and nitrous oxide (N O) resulting mainly from nitrogen fertilization of agricultural land – 2 and it constitutes a carbon sink by sequestering and storing carbon in soils agricultural. On the other hand yield of agricultural production. The IPCC special report on climate change and land areas210 highlights the global impacts of climate change on natural terrestrial ecosystems soil and food security. Extreme climatic and meteorological phenomena are increasingly frequent and intense to climate change in a foresighted manner is therefore essential resilience and ensure long-term food production. To make the transition successful climate and more resilient. It should be noted that the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices can contribute to simultaneously strengthening the resilience of production. Summarily slightly outweigh arable land (47% fodder (46%)). With a workforce of approximately 191,000 units212 in 2020 most of the livestock. in 2019 compared to 2005 i.e. around 10%.

The main strategic measures identified at the national level to implement the required sustainable agricultural investments and practices and thus reduce the CH and NO emissions 4 2 climatic  Align the national strategic plan and the implementation of the CAP at national level with the climate goals for 2030 and 2050  Develop a national strategy to reduce methane emissions the coalition agreement215  Reduce the use of mineral and organic fertilizers nitrogenous adapted to the needs of the plants: An appropriate combination of incentives regulatory requirements and consulting services is required. About spreading low-emission techniques are preferred. Precision agriculture can contribute to achieve balanced fertilization.  Promote the reduction of livestock so as to reduce its climate footprint and environmental animal: Alongside the reduction in the number of livestock feed and herd management have the potential to lower emissions enteric fermentation. Besides must decrease low level of emissions and by recovering livestock manure through biomethanation. The implementation requires financial support and technical advice progressive reinforcement of the requirements to be respected.  Improve the recovery of livestock effluents or other organic residues by biomethanation ecological agriculture (thanks in particular to the recycling of nutrients digestate or to the reduction of methane and ammonia emissions). Since in 2018 only slightly more than a tenth of livestock manure was used in the biomethanation  Develop organic agriculture: Under the coalition agreement216 national promotion of organic farming217 aims to reach 20% of the agricultural areas used in organic farming by 2025 more supply and demand.

Furthermore in agriculture social knowledge relating to an agriculture compatible with climate neutrality and promote innovation in Luxembourg agriculture through development projects relevant research. In addition to reducing the climate footprint of agriculture economic and environmental co-benefits in terms of air quality more biodiversity Ultimately in a first step 2050219. In this context in sensitive areas as well as the promotion of conservation tillage and cultivation of hedging contribute to the partial maintenance of existing carbon sinks. The reinforcement necessary carbon sequestration in agricultural soils is favored by the reduction of labour permanent. It is thus necessary to extend the surface of permanent grasslands to a minimization of plowing of cultivated land and promote intermediate crops and spacers and grass strips. Since monocultures deplete the soil with varieties adapted to the land. The aim is to maintain the organic carbon content and above all to stimulate the formation of organic carbon in cultivated land. To this end detailed guidelines will be developed. Agroforestry makes it possible to optimize the sequestration of carbon climate change hedges at the edge of the plot are a well-known element. Significantly increase their length and their development is important and serves similar purposes to agroforestry. To conclude enhance agricultural land as a carbon sink ecological220. 218 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 219 See the chapter “Silviculture and carbon sinks” 220 See also the “4 per 1000” initiative: https://www.4p1000.org/fr Towards climate neutrality in 2050 81 / 97 6.7 Forestry and carbon sinks All mitigation scenarios assessed in the IPCC special reports on the consequences of a global warming of 1 to maintain warming at 1 land use English) to absorb carbon from the atmosphere.

This carbon sequestration was mainly achieved thanks to ecosystems forestiers. Or climatic. Problems such as droughts and summer heat waves or the bark beetle epidemic are currently already a reality that Luxembourg's forests have to deal with. Their impact is getting worse national phytosanitary. More than 50% of the trees show obvious signs of stress (classes of defoliation 2 to 4) since 2019. To improve the resilience of forests to these extreme events adaptation to the effects of climate change in Luxembourg224 provides for the three measures following main ones:  Draw up a complete map of forest biotopes and develop a catalog of measures for sustainable forestry in the context of a changing climate;  Convert monocultures to mixed forests;  Preserve reservoir of water and carbon and nutritional source. These strategic measures aim to better anticipate the adaptation of forests to change. climatic. They are accompanied by legislative measures aimed at further protecting biotopes and a series of studies such as the analysis of the potential for sustainable timber harvesting and the development of a decision support tool for the choice of species adapted to the station “ecological file of species”. in addition forest owners and managers are strengthened and diversified to encourage them to choose the species best adapted to the stations and to create mixed and diversified forests both at the level species as at the genetic level that can better withstand climatic stress. All of these measures 221 IPCC relative to pre-industrial levels and associated trajectories of global greenhouse gas emissions in the context of strengthening the global response to climate change and the fight against poverty 222 IPCC climatic greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems 223 See the chapter “Food and agriculture” 224 See the chapter “Adaptation to climate change” Towards climate neutrality in 2050 82 / 97 and soft farming methods close to nature the forests in Luxembourg.

This method of logging close to nature also makes it possible to better adapt forests to the effects of climate change and maintain carbon uptake. In addition to the preservation of carbon sinks these latter carbon emissions from agricultural land225 and given that the area available for afforestation is very limited in Luxembourg volume of wood in existing forests by increasing the protection surface of old forests However, the potential for a net increase in the volume of wood in the forest remains limited because of the decline of spruce monocultures226. Regarding the open environment measures such as the restoration of biotopes and trees or the establishment of an effective green infrastructure should contribute significantly to better provision of ecosystem services including carbon sequestration. An important lever concerns the wood sector To make a long term impact and long life is about innovating and making better use of the wood resource wood. For this purpose Cluster227. The import of unsustainable wood should be avoided. Ultimately demographic and economic of carbon sinks. Strategies must therefore be developed to curb this trend and minimize soil artificialization. 225 See the chapter “Food and agriculture” 226 https://environnement.public.lu/content/dam/environnement/documents/natur/forets/Etude-du- potential-biomass-forestiere-Luxembourg.pdf 227 https://www.luxinnovation.lu/cluster/luxembourg-wood-cluster/ Towards climate neutrality in 2050 83 / 97 6.8 Sustainable finance The financing needs of the transition to a low-carbon economy remain very important in 2018.228 Additional capital must therefore be mobilized financial flows is essential to achieve the objective of the Paris Agreement to “make flows financial instruments compatible with an evolution profile towards development with low GHG emissions and resilient to climate change. The financial sector must gradually integrate the environmental factors risks related to the exposure of its portfolios to unrecoverable projects and assets. Beyond the financing needs of the transition to climate neutrality in Luxembourg229 Luxembourg's role in sustainable finance is far more important than the size of the country would predict. The Government continues to promote efforts to establish Luxembourg as an international center for green and sustainable finance by creating an exemplary ecosystem for sustainable and internationally competitive finance230. In addition to the importance of its place financial the leader in international climate finance. Sustainable finance includes all public or private measures that aim to make financial flows compatible with low GHG emission development climate change and environmental degradation. Sustainable finance is also about account of social and governance aspects. In fgeneral climate change that responds to international funding commitments climate change and international solidarity in order to mobilize more private funds and make the national financial center more sustainable as well as initiatives from the private sector or civil society. It’s about that, too to gradually establish a sustainable fiscal policy231. The importance of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of June 18, 2020232 (taxonomy) which establishes a frame of reference to define which economic activities can be considered as durable. The taxonomy helps define what part of the economy is actually green. She will require large companies to declare the portion of their activity that is compatible with the taxonomy also subject to these regulations. The European taxonomy therefore clearly adopts a transversal approach to the definition of sustainability and will serve as a reference for all European legislation related to sustainability. 6.8.1 Mobilization of private capital and redirection of financial flows As climate finance reaches record highs internationally still very far from what is needed for a scenario of 1 additional annual needs of USD 830 billion between 2016 and 2050 228 https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-Global-Landscape-of-Climate- Finance.pdf 229 See the chapter “Financing the transition to climate neutrality” 230 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 231 See the chapter “Sustainable public finance: integrating climate aspects into the State budget” 232 Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to encourage investments durable Towards climate neutrality in 2050 84 / 97 investments related to energy systems. Furthermore estimates annual adaptation costs at USD 180 billion from 2020 to 2030. Today sustainable financing that connects investors around the world. In the coalition agreement233 Government has made sustainable finance a priority for the development of the financial centre. The objective is to make Luxembourg a center of excellence for sustainable financing and to promote new public-private partnerships in the field of sustainable financing. In this context other sources of funding from the private sector. This is how support for modes of innovative financing is pursued. Luxembourg has launched since 2016 budget volunteer in collaboration with financial sector partners   La « LU-EIB Climate Finance Platform » investment fund (EIB) fight against climate change by combining it with a “first loss” guarantee (“first loss”). This is the first time that the EIB has embarked on such a project with a State. member. Such an initiative is crucial to reduce the risks (“de-risking”) of climate investments and thus attract private investors invest in normal time.   L’« International Climate Finance Accelerator » financial and operational to future fund managers to enable them to launch innovative new climate funds. Generally durable sustainable investment products green bond (EIB) in the world was listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange in 2007 and the "Luxembourg Green Exchange (LGX)” was established in 2016. LGX is the world’s first platform exclusively dedicated to green and sustainable financial instruments. Currently green bonds listed worldwide are listed in Luxembourg. With more than EUR 5 trillion of assets under management in investment funds is the 2nd center for investment funds in the world after the United States and benefits in particular strong international recognition in the field of sustainable funds. In effect Luxembourg is the leading center in Europe for sustainable funds with 34% of these funds and 35% durable assets. In order to make its financial center more sustainable sustainable finance roadmap for Luxembourg Roadmap (LSFR) » for the environment. This will further consolidate the leading role of the financial center in the field of sustainable finance. 233 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 234 KPMG https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/lu/pdf/lu-en-European%20Responsible%20Investment%20Fund- 2019.pdf Towards climate neutrality in 2050 85 / 97 In the years to come further analyzes this goal created competent ministers. In 2021 (« Luxembourg  Sustainable  Finance  Strategy »)235 government. The LSFI is responsible for the implementation of this strategy and also serves as discussion platform concerning the analysis of the feasibility and impact of the measures resulting from recommendations of the LSFR. The LSFI will make a voluntary assessment of the climate risks of the investments of the various actors of the Luxembourg financial center (banks The Common Compensation Fund for the General Pension Scheme (FDC) was created with the aim of allow the reserve to benefit from the general Luxembourg pension insurance scheme financial markets by investing this reserve on the financial markets through a diversified portfolio subject to strict risk and return criteria in order to guarantee the long-term sustainability of the general pension insurance scheme. The importance of FDC in the future financing of the benefits imperatively requires that the investments be made in a sustainability goal. Thereby directing investments towards green and sustainable finance gradual and sustainable carbon activities in the FDC portfolio. The FDC is aware of its ecological responsibilities taken into account in the FDC’s investment strategy and in its investment decisions. the FDC has already:  set up an exclusion list of companies that do not comply with the standards international organizations as enshrined in the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact covering human rights fight against corruption ;  mandated fund managers who promote and integrate sustainability as a organization;  selected integrate sustainability into their investment strategies;  Undertook a detailed assessment of climate risks and climate scenarios of its aggregate portfolio of stocks and bonds. 6.8.2 International climate finance: international solidarity Provide sufficient financial resources globally to support climate action and climate change adaptation is a cornerstone of climate finance efforts international (CFI). Under the Paris Agreement their level of financial support and to facilitate adequate investments and support for capacity building in developing countries. Long-term will need to take many forms across the funding spectrum to achieve this. objective. Luxembourg sees a specific role in public support for climate finance time to help developing countries design and finance major interventions 235 https://lsfi.lu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Luxembourg-Sustainable-Finance-Strategy_EN.pdf 236 Luxembourg Sustainable Finance Strategy Sustainable-Finance-Strategy_EN.pdf Towards climate neutrality by 2050 86 / 97 and to mobilize low-carbon and climate-resilient investments private sector. Luxembourg is one of the largest donors per capita of public FCI in the world. For the period from 2014 to 2020 attenuation deforestation and forest degradation) in developing countries. For the period of 2021 to 2025 new and additional funds to development, which is equivalent to about 1% of gross national income in 2018. The national strategy of “Allocation of funds for the international financing of the fight against Climate Change” published in 2017 and revised in 2021 is deeply rooted in the objectives defined by the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. It aims to align with the objectives of the action climatic United Nations for Sustainable Development of Sendai for Disaster Risk Reduction. The 2021-2025 revision of the FCI strategy responds to recent regulatory developments in particular the adoption of key elements of the “Paris Rulebook” of Luxembourg in terms of climate finance as well as international best practices. In the years to come at all times to new regulatory requirements as well as new emerging needs and to align with new technologies and methodologies facilitating the transition to neutrality climatic. Towards climate neutrality by 2050 87 / 97 7 Adaptation to climate change Although Luxembourg has long been spared to feel more and more regularly and more and more intensely in Luxembourg. From extreme climatic events have recently occurred in the form of periods of drought and prolonged high heat or torrential rains causing heavy flooding. While the observations show that multi-year average temperatures have already fallen from 8 (reference period 1861-1890) reference 1981-2010) to 9 indicate that this trend will continue and intensify in the future. Future projections237 indicate that the average air temperature is likely to increase to at least 11 at the end of the 21st century. Although there will not be large variations in annual rainfall the projections indicate a regression in the amounts of precipitation during the summer months and an increase during the winter months. Related to higher air temperatures during winter months the risk of flooding. In summer predictable. The impact on human well-being and health climate change in general and associated extreme weather events in particular is undeniable. To avoid having to face the most serious consequences of climate change particular to irreversible effects compared to the pre-industrial era. The mitigation of climate change must therefore remain a priority. However mitigation to come. We therefore have no choice but to take adaptation measures to deal with to the inevitable effects of climate change. The strategy for adapting to the effects of climate change238 for the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is part of the EU strategy on adapting to change climatic Adopted by the Government on October 12, 2018 strategy and action plan for adaptation to the effects of climate change in Luxembourg lists the foreseeable consequences of climate change and identifies 13 sectors affected by these consequences. For each sector classified according to their probability of occurrence as well as according to their degree of importance for the Luxembourg. The strategy thus proposes carrying out actions as a priority for the most serious consequences. relevant in each sector affected by the effects of climate change the agricultural sector. What's more of adaptation planned sufficiently in advance than to pay the price of inadequacy. Outraged the disastrous consequences for the loss of biodiversity water shortages 237 Evolution of the air temperature in Luxembourg calculated from a set of projections climatic; period 1961-2098.

In effect IPCC240 concluded that the longer governments delay future. Inaction could cause global GDP to decline by 1-4% in 2030 2050 adaptation can reduce the future costs of climate change and limit the risks significant impacts. According to this report to more than one percentage point of GDP by the end of the century. The strategy thus proposes 42 measures intended to provide political guidance. It's about mainly so-called “no regrets” measures climate will be beneficial for Luxembourg. Furthermore also contribute to the mitigation of emissions. The measures were developed in consultation and in collaboration with all the actors concerned and it will come down to the various policies sectors to materialize and implement them by 2023. In order to assess the state progress of the implementation The consequences linked to climate change in Luxembourg are most often closely water bound The management of these extreme events is therefore essential to adapt effectively to the effects of climate change. To deal with the risk of flooding 2015 the flood risk management plan for the cycle from 2015 to 2021242. The management plan is updated in 2021 for the 2021 to 2027 cycle. It is a planning tool strategy for better flood risk management potential negative consequences of a flood for the population cultural heritage and economic activity flood preparation. The expenses generated by the implementation of measures intended to reduce the effects of floods can be covered up to 90 percent of the cost by the Fund for water management at the water. This rate is 100 percent of the cost for tuition fees and expenses. related. In order to better inform the population flood risks have been declared compulsory by Grand-Ducal regulation243. A project of revision of these maps was presented in 2019 and finalized in 2021. Maps representing the danger flash floods were also published in 2021 on the National Geoportal244. In order to have effective adaptation measures knowledge and experience acquired in the implementation of the measures. From reliable scientific knowledge and high-resolution climate scenarios are essential to be able to realistically assess the effects of climate change and the risks climatic. It is therefore important to update and complete them regularly.

The climate law gives a strong legal basis to the adaptation strategy in the face of the effects of climate change provides that every ten years a strategy for adapting to the effects of change be adopted climate change over a period of at least fifty years. The strategy for adapting to the effects of change climate will have to 245 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/fr/ip_21_663 Towards climate neutrality in 2050 90 / 97 8 Financing the transition to climate neutrality From 2006 cost about 1% of global GDP up to 20% in the worst case. In 2014 governments delay cause a drop in global GDP of 1 to 4% in 2030 It is therefore urgent to act economic. The motto "act now instead of having to adapt later" is based also on an economic logic. The fact remains that the transformation of the Luxembourg economy towards neutrality climate requires very significant public and private investments by 2050. Building on on the efforts already made guarantee the financing of the transition and the modernization of the economy. The challenge is to prioritize investment flows in favor of climate action priorities fully the financial system248 climate neutrality outlined throughout the “Acting for the climate” chapter of this strategy. The predictability of the regulatory framework is crucial to guarantee the mobilization of financial flows public and private required. Thanks to a judicious use of their potential leverage effect budgetary stimulate the private investments required to decarbonise and modernize the economy249. here is a summary and non-exhaustive list of financial tools available to the public authorities:  Public investments in the areas education charging network for electric vehicles etc.) ;  Sustainable public procurement  “Negative” tax incentives (e.g. carbon pricing cars etc.) ;  Mobilization and energy House aiming to promote sustainable construction promotion of renewable energies in housing; purchase incentive schemes of an electric vehicle and the installation of a charging station; premium for the supply of forest ecosystem services ("Klimabonus Bësch") 250; aid regimes to 246 Stern Review: The Economics of Climate Change https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100407172811/http://www.hm- treasury.gov.uk/stern_review_report.htm 247 IPCC 248 See also the chapter “Sustainable finance” 249 See also the chapter “Sustainable public finance: integrating climate aspects into the budget of the state" tax: providing the necessary incentives” 250 Introduced by the Grand-Ducal regulation of 16 April 2021 establishing a premium for the provision of services ecosystems in forest environment Towards climate neutrality by 2050 91 / 97 investment in environmental protection or research business development and innovation; etc);  Implementation of innovative financial instruments (e.g. pre-financing and de-risking risk management An interesting innovation in the refinancing of public expenditure in favor of the transformation is certainly the recent implementation in Luxembourg of a reference framework for sovereign sustainable bonds251. In addition to national financing tools an increased and targeted use of European funds and instruments can provide means very useful extras In conclusion must not lose sight of the fact that investments in the green modernization of the economy Luxembourg will be essential to maintaining or even improving the long-term competitiveness of the country and will require planning in line with the budgetary trajectory and Stability and Growth Pact requirements sustainably healthy and balanced. 251 See the chapter “Sustainable public finance: integrating climate aspects into the State budget” Towards climate neutrality by 2050 92 / 97 Recognizing that economic recovery plans to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic offer a unique opportunity to accelerate the green and sustainable transformation of the economy Government has included a package of measures strengthening some of the aforementioned instruments in the plan national “Neistart Lëtzebuerg” 252. The package contains an increase in financial aid for encourage the sustainable energy renovation of housing based on renewable energies and investments in photovoltaic energy the purchase of electric vehicles Globally fully the general orientations of the EU in the fight against the economic effects of the pandemic. Thereby Duchy of Luxembourg253 (PRR) correspond to the objectives set out in the Next Generation EU and the Recovery and Resilience Facility. Luxembourg's PRR sets out a roadmap for rebuild an economy able to meet the challenges of a post-COVID-19 world. This roadmap aims above all to lay the groundwork for establishing a resilient socio-economic environment while successfully completing the green and digital transitions. It should be noted that 61% of the funds are dedicated to contribution to efforts in the fight against climate change. The PRR is part of the continuity of government action at the center of which is the policy in favor of social cohesion and the promotion of an economic environment modern and attractive partly on existing strategies developed in the broader framework of the implementation of the priorities of the Government. For exemple climatic conditions are consistent with the PNEC. Concretely Government and meet the various criteria set out at European level 3 pillars  “Cohesion and social resilience”;  “Green transition”; and   « Digitalisation 252 www.clever-primes.lu 253 https://gouvernement.lu/fr/dossiers.gouv_mfin%2Bfr%2Bdossiers%2B2021%2Bplanderelance.html Towards climate neutrality in 2050 93 / 97 9 Ensuring a just transition A just transition to climate neutrality has several essential characteristics. First of the public to facilitate and actively support the transition are a source of wealth creation. Secondly is a planned transition and must therefore take into account the impact on social well-being and the means livelihoods of citizens while guaranteeing them decent work. A just transition means putting people first and paying attention to economic sectors and workers who are likely to be most affected. The transformation to a net-zero GHG emissions economy is a social challenge economic. Decarbonization requires significant changes in the behaviors of consumption consumption behavior and responsible use of resources. The main risk associated with the transition is that the heaviest burden falls on those who are less well placed to support it. Without proper compensation used to adjust behavior (e.g. fiscal instruments) can be regressive affecting especially disadvantaged people who devote a larger share of their budget heating and transportation. Similarly energy consumption can be difficult to achieve for those without the ability to pay or borrow sufficient. Consequently do not have the financial resources to invest in energy efficiency will be difficult for them to reduce their consumption of fossil fuels without reducing considerably and more their standard of living. This is all the more the case if we consider that these people are more likely to live in poorly insulated homes The challenge of a just transition to climate neutrality is thus to reduce emissions while minimizing the impact on the social and economic well-being of the entire population. A combination of different policy instruments is necessary to achieve a decarbonisation of the economy. At the same time that no one is left behind. For the transition to be fair how behavioral levers are used and how these changes affect people in different ways. To do this emerging forms of discrimination that appear in the context of ecological transition. In this respect sex and respond to multiple forms of discrimination. To ensure a fair transition complemented by appropriate mitigation measures. These may include transfers in 254 Communication from the European Commission (COM(2019) 640 final): The European Green Deal Towards climate neutrality in 2050 94 / 97 species255 in-kind services and investments in public infrastructure. Measures are particularly effective in countering the regressive effects their beneficiaries are mainly concentrated in vulnerable groups. The state can therefore play an important role in smoothing consumption over the life cycle and helping low-income households to make investments that will pay off in the future. By analogy to the effects on citizens on businesses in general and small and medium-sized businesses in particular. In effect with regard to economic growth and job creation. Care should therefore be taken to the competitiveness of SMEs setting up of any digressive subsidy schemes. To finance mitigation measures carbon pricing can help generate revenue that can be used to mitigate the regressive effects of rising energy prices. If these revenues can be directed to vulnerable groups pre-existing inequalities can be corrected. The coalition agreement specifies in this regard that "the revenues generated by an increase in energy taxation finance societal efforts necessary to make the ecological transition just and strengthen social equity”. Thereby tax was introduced and the cost of living allowance increased CO taxes 2 of the CO₂ tax on households with a low standard of living is neutralized thanks to the tax credit on households becomes progressive (increases with the standard of living). Nevertheless note that these recipes are transitional the decarbonization of the economy. If energy taxation and other financial instruments can adjust behaviors and generate revenue consumers to change their behavior. Interventions aimed at changing behavior aim for better access to information access to infrastructure personal values and subjective norms. It has been shown that especially the standards subjective behviour 255 An example is the cost of living allowance. Furthermore of social assistance provides that any person meeting the conditions of eligibility for social assistance is entitled to a minimum domestic energy supply under specified conditions to cover the cost of its domestic energy. Thereby their energy bills can benefit from social assistance from the competent social office. 256 Such as free public transport 257 Such as climate loans (low interest rate or interest free) for the sustainable renovation of a lodging 258 Such as the tax credit introduced as part of the implementation of the CO tax to reduce the burden 2 low-income households 259 Coalition Agreement 2018-2023 260 STATEC 2 Towards climate neutrality by 2050 95 / 97 sustainable behavior can only be achieved, however, if individuals and companies have adequate alternatives and can access the appropriate infrastructure. Thanks to public investments keys weight in the market allows them to influence the development and adoption of innovative solutions and sustainable through public tenders mobility By investing in these areas essential in these sectors and ensures that workers can find decent work. In same time to qualify the workforce and Some business benefits structural professional. This can support vulnerable workers and help them access better job opportunities field of environmental technologies. Given that reforms initiated towards climate neutrality may have implications important in terms of welfare and political economy and to provide agile and creative policy responses. A better understanding of engines relevant desirable behaviors is essential for the development of structures incentives and the deployment of adequate policy instruments. Continuous monitoring ex ante and ex post evaluations and impact assessments can help make policy choices effective while minimizing financial and social costs. In the event of an adverse reaction should not abandon the objective of climate neutrality best solutions to mitigate the negative effects. Luxembourg is particularly well placed to play a pioneering role in the transition to a decarbonized economy. The transition to a sustainable economy developed in this and previous strategies261 outlines many opportunities for improve Luxembourg's competitiveness and increase its standard of living. Luxembourg has already transitioned to a predominantly service-based economy and is attracting a large number of highly skilled workers. The country's strong fiscal position has enabled it to maintain a generous social protection system spearhead of an innovative policy. The institutionalized negotiation process between the different social partners plays an important role in maintaining social cohesion and will continue to do so. do so by offering a platform for exchange. A participatory process gives citizens society and actors in the economic world the possibility of committing and the acceptability of political action. If Luxembourg takes advantage of this unique set of characteristics provide the necessary conditions for a just transition to a decarbonized economy competitive and inclusive. 261 Third Industrial Revolution Strategic Study for the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg https://www.troisiemerevolutionindustrielle.lu/etude-strategique/; Luxembourg 2030 – 3rd National Plan for sustainable development period 2021-2030 (PNEC) https://environnement.public.lu/fr/actualites/2020/05/pnec.html Towards climate neutrality in 2050 96 / 97 List of abbreviations EIB European Investment Bank UNFCCC United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) CDA Development and Attraction Centers CH methane 4 CO carbon dioxide 2 EC Circular Economy ETS EU Emissions Trading System EU greenhouse) GHG Greenhouse Gases IPCC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) kt CO eq kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent 2 LENOZ Luxembourg Sustainability Certification LULUCF  Land  Use Land Use and Forestry (LULUCF)) MECDD Ministry of the Environment Mt CO2eq million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent N O nitrous oxide 2 NSEC    North Seas Energy Cooperation NZEB Nearly Zero Energy Building(s) SDGs Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda CAP Common Agricultural Policy PDAT Director Program for Territorial Development GDP Gross Domestic Product SMEs Small and Medium Enterprises PNEC Luxembourg Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for the period 2021-2030 ICT Information and Communication Technologies EU European Union Towards climate neutrality in 2050 97 / 97
