Long-Term Strategy for Low Carbon 
and Climate Resilience 2050
(Indonesia LTS-LCCR 2050)
- 2021 -FOREWORD
Climate change is recognised as one of the most complex, multi-faceted, 
and severe threats to humanity.  Guided by the common but differentiated 
responsibilities and respective capability principle of the UNFCC Convention, 
the actual response to the climate challenge is determined by the ability of 
individual countries to adapt or build resilience to a changing climate, while 
contributing  to  the  global  greenhouse  gas  mitigation  effort  as  indicated 
through Parties’ NDCs. As mandated by the Paris Agreement, Parties are invited 
to envisage a long-term climate vision under a half century of strategy on low 
GHG emission.  
Responding to this mandate, Indonesia submits Long-Term Strategy for Low 
Carbon and Climate Resilience 2050, which aims to contribute to global goal 
and to achieve national development objectives, taking into consideration 
the  balance  between  emission  reduction,  economic  growth,  justice  and 
climate resilience development. The LTS-LCCR 2050 also reflects the mandate 
Indonesian Constitution (UUD 45) Article 28 H on the state obligation to 
guarantee decent life and healthy environment for all citizens.  
Under the LTS-LCCR 2050, Indonesia seeks opportunities for international 
partnerships to support sustainable transition towards low carbon economy 
and green recovery post COVID-19 pandemic as well as global justice. We 
believe this would be an opportunity to start a transition phase which will lead to 
transformation of our whole economy, social and environmental development.
The implementation of a low carbon and climate resilience strategy requires a 
balanced focus on the process of government coordination and stakeholders 
engagement as well as considering the issues on just transition, gender, inter-
generation, the needs of vulnerable groups, adat communities (Masyarakat 
Hukum Adat) and local community.

(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)ii INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)PREFACE
As a country that is vulnerable to the adverse impact of climate change and 
contributes to global greenhouse gas emission, Indonesia is highly committed 
to reduce GHG emission. In the First NDC, Indonesia has unconditional target 
of 29% and conditional target up to 41% compared to business as usual in 2030.  
Through LTS-LCCR 2050, Indonesia will increase ambition on GHG reduction 
by achieving the peaking of national GHG emissions in 2030 with net- sink of 
forest and land-use sector, reaching 540 Mton CO e by 2050, and with further 
2
exploring opportunity to rapidly progress towards net-zero emission in 2060 
or sooner.
In order to achieve this target, forestry sector will share considerable efforts to 
maintain increasing trend of net-sink after 2030, significant transition of energy 
sector by raising the proportion of renewable energy in energy mix, increasing 
energy  efficiency,  reducing  substantial  amount  of  coal  consumption  and 
implementing CCS/ CCUS and BECCS.
This ambitious target requires transformational changes  both in energy system 
and food- and land-use system, which needs to address potential trade-offs 
amongst a large number of targets such as energy security, food security, 
biodiversity conservation, avoiding deforestation, freshwater use, as well as 
competing land use.
Indonesia considers mitigation and adaptation have a complementary role in 
responding to climate change which is carried out at different spatial, temporal, 
and institutional scales.  The LTS-LCCR 2050 sets the goal of adaptation 
pathways to reduce the impact of climate change on national GDP loss by 
3.45% in 2050, through increasing resilience in four basic necessities (food, 
water, energy, and environmental health), with three target areas of resilience  
(economy, social and livelihood, ecosystem and landscape).

(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)I. LONG-TERM VISION
In  line  with  Indonesia’s  constitution  (UUD 
1945,  Article  28  H)  which  emphasizes  the 
state obligation to guarantee decent life and 
healthy environment for all citizens, Indonesia’s 
commitment  to  the  Paris  Agreement  has 
been  translated  into  :  (i)  ratification  of  the 
Paris Agreement with the highest regulatory 
instrument (Law No. 16/2016), (ii) First NDC 
with  its update and detail NDC road maps 
as the basis for its implementation, and (iii) 
long-term strategy on low carbon and climate 
resilience (LTS-LCCR). 
Law  No.  32/2009  regarding  Environmental 
Protection  and  Management  with  its 
objectives to protect environmental function 
sustainability, enforce the wise use of natural 
resources, achieve sustainable development 
and anticipate global environmental issues, 
has  provided  a  strong  legal  basis  for  the 
development of LTS-LCCR.
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  1
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)The LTS-LCCR plays a central role in : (i) aligning the climate goals and targets 
with national, sub-national and international objectives including SDGs; (ii) 
engaging  non-party  stakeholders  (NPS),  (iii)  enhancing  opportunities  for 
innovation, and (iv) enabling communities to earn benefits of early actions. 
Furthermore, the LTS-LCCR will also strengthen the vision of One Hundred 
Years Indonesia (Visi Indonesia 2045) towards a developed and prosperous 
Indonesia based on its four following pillars: (a) human resource development 
and  science  and  technology  advancement,  (b)  sustainable  economic 
development,  (c)  equitable  development,  and  (d)  strengthening  national 
resilience and public sector governance.
The LTS-LCCR is designed by taking into consideration the need to balance 
between  emission  reduction  and  economic  development,  and  putting 
emission reduction, economic growth, justice or fairness and climate resilient 
development as an integral part of the LTS-LCCR’s goal. Conducive environment 
for investment, structural reform to support growth, and well-designed climate 
policy as prerequisites for a successful LTS-LCCR will be part of cross cutting 
policies and measures to be addressed during the implementation of the 
LTS-LCCR. Furthermore, gender issues, just transition, intergeneration and 
vulnerable groups, as strategic supporting issues will also be addressed during 
the LTS-LCCR implementation. 
The LTS-LCCR 2050 provides long-term national policy direction on climate 
change, with the pathway scenario based on the best available science. It 
allows adjustment overtime to keep pace with national and global dynamics.
1.1. Mitigation 
Three  pathway  scenarios  were  exercised  during  the  development  of 
Indonesia’s LTS-LCCR to provide understanding in a transparent manner on 
the consequences of each option of scenarios in terms of emission reduction 
and economic impacts, prerequisites both domestically and internationally for 
successful implementation of the most ambitious scenario. The three defined 
pathway scenarios are the following : (i) extended unconditional commitment 
of NDC/current policy scenario (named as CPOS), (ii) transition scenario (named 
2 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)as TRNS), and (iii) low carbon scenario compatible with the Paris Agreement 
target (named as LCCP). 
Two  stages  modelling  were  employed  to  develop  these  three  pathway 
scenarios,  by  first  modelling  AFOLU  (agriculture,  forestry  and  other  land 
uses) and Non-AFOLU (energy, waste, and IPPU) separately. Both modelling 
considered economic and population growth as the key drivers for changes in 
food and energy demand. The second stage analysed economic and economic 
impacts for both AFOLU and Non-AFOLU sectors. 
Under CPOS, emissions shows continuous increase after 2030, while TRNS 
shows emission decrease but it will not be sufficient to reach 2050 emission 
level which is compatible with the Paris Agreement target. Under LCCP, rapid 
decrease in emissions will occur after 2030, reaching 540 Mton CO e by 2050 
2
or equivalent to about 1.61 ton CO e per capita. 
2
Through low carbon scenario compatible with the Paris Agreement 
target (LCCP), Indonesia foresees to reach the peaking of national 
GHGs emissions in 2030 with net sink in forestry and land uses 
(FOLU), and with further exploring opportunity to rapidly progress 
towards net-zero emission in 2060 or sooner.
With this scenario, Indonesia need to significantly reduce emission 
from energy sector to close to zero and increase removals in 
forestry and land uses. This will require transformational changes in 
energy system as well as food and land-use system, which need to 
address a large number of targets with potential trade-offs among 
them, such as target relating to energy security, food security, 
biodiversity conservation, avoiding deforestation, freshwater use, 
nitrogen and phosphorus uses, as well as competing use of lands.
1.1.1. AFOLU 
The  CPOS  suggested  that  emission  continue  to  decline  since  the  base 
year (2010) and will reach negative emission (net sink) by 2050, while the 
LCCP emission pathway will turn into net sink by 2030. In both scenarios, 
the significant reduction of emission occurs due to significant decrease in 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  3
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)deforestation and peat related emission (peat fire and peat decomposition), 
and  significant  increase  in  carbon  sequestration  from  secondary  forest, 
afforestation and reforestation. The strategy for avoiding deforestation while 
maintaining sectoral target is by improving crop productivity and cropping 
intensity, implementing integrated farming or complex agroforestry, optimizing 
the use of unproductive lands (idle lands), and reducing food loss and waste. 
As part of transformational changes in food and land use systems, a number 
of innovative policies and measures (PaMs) have been initiated to curb GHGs 
emissions, conserve and restore biodiversity, promote healthy diets, ensure rural 
livelihoods, adapt to climate change, and meet other environmental standards, 
including sustainable use of freshwater resources, reducing pollutants, and 
halting the loss of marine and coastal ecosystem services. 
Indonesia’s commitment in improving forest governance has also brought 
about  international  recognition  and  rewards  through  REDD+  result-based 
payments,  especially  in  maintaining  the  remaining  natural  forests.  This 
successful endeavour has been supported by a number of PaMs including: 
(i) Presidential Instruction No. 5/2019 on termination of new license issuance 
on peatland, (ii) implementation of mandatory certification for sustainable 
forest management, (iii) Government Regulation No. 46/2016 on strategic 
environmental  assessments  (SEAs)  through  landscape  approach  aiming 
at securing food, water, and energy security based on sound ecosystem 
management,  (iv)  Government  Regulation  No.  46/2017  on  Environmental 
Economic  Instrument,  and  (v)  Presidential  Regulation  No.  77/2018  on  the 
establishment of Environmental Fund Management Agency (BPDLH). 
These PaMs provide a good foundation for implementing low carbon development 
compatible with the Paris Agreement target. Effective implementation of these 
PaMs and adequate international support (investment, technology, and capacity 
building) could bring AFOLU sector become net sink in 2030.
4 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)1.1.2. Energy
Four following guiding pillars were used to develop long-term low carbon 
strategy in energy sector taking into account past development and future 
projection  of  energy  demand  and  supply  :  (i)  implementation  of  energy 
efficiency  measures;  (ii)  use  of  decarbonized  electricity  in  transport  and 
buildings; (iii) fuel shift from coal to gas and renewables in industry; and (iv) 
enhancement of renewable energy in power, transport and industry. 
Energy demand will increase along with economic development and population 
growth. Implementation of energy efficiency measures will bring about energy 
intensity of all energy consuming sectors in 2050 to be much lower than the 
one in the base year. From the three scenarios which were used to develop the 
long-term low carbon strategy indicated that CPOS will not lead to efficient 
energy systems. The TRNS and LCCP enable effective implementation of 
energy efficiency measures in the end user sides. The projection indicated 
that there will be a significant change toward 2050 where electricity will be a 
dominant type of energy in the future, and therefore, a significant impact can 
be obtained through mitigation actions which focus on power generation. 
The projection of power generation mix shows that electricity generation will 
increase significantly as a result of economic development, people welfare 
and population growth. There will also be significant differences in energy 
generation mix of the three scenarios. On energy inputs, the CPOS will rely 
primarily on coal while the TRNS and LCCP will be more diversified. On emission 
level, the CPOS will result in continuous increase in emission and reach around 
2,116 Mton in 2050. The TRNS where significant and high impact mitigation 
actions start to be implemented, will result in a lower emission level but with 
increasing trend and reach around 1,439 Mton in 2050. The LCCP will give the 
lowest emission level in 2050, where high impact mitigation actions such as 
carbon capture and storage (CCS) as well as carbon capture, utilization and 
storage (CCUS) will be largely implemented. Under the LCCP, a significant 
decreasing trend of emissions will occur after 2030 from 1,030 Mton CO e 
2
towards around 572 Mton CO e in 2050.

FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)1.1.3. Waste
The long-term pathway considers both historical development and projection 
of future waste management activities (reduction, avoidance, destruction, and 
utilization of GHG emissions), particularly methane gas (CH ) from the waste 
4
treatment processes of municipal solid waste (MSW), domestic wastewater, 
and industrial waste.
The projection of GHG emissions assumed the rate of increase in the amount 
of waste generation and waste to be treated in each treatment unit is affected 
by population, economic growth, policies and regulations, lifestyle, treatment 
plans, and the success of source reduction activities. 
Under CPOS, GHG emissions will continue to increase to reach 272 Mton CO e  
2
in 2050, while under TRNS, GHG emissions will continue to increase to reach 
223 Mton of CO e in 2050. Under LCCP, GHG emissions level will decrease 
2
after 2030 and reach 120 Mton CO e in 2050.
2
1.1.4. Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU)
Indonesia specifies cement, basic chemicals (ammonia fertilizer, nitric acid, 
other  petrochemicals),  iron  and  steel  making,  and  metal  smelters  (nickel, 
gold, aluminium, bauxite, etc.) as IPPU emissions intensive industries and GHG 
energy emissions intensives with coal as the main energy sources. Master Plan 
of national industry development (RIPIN) 2015-2035 projected 10.5% growth 
rate of national manufacturing industry except oil and gas. 
In the long-term mitigation scenarios, the CPOS assumed that mitigation and 
policies under unconditional NDC are extended to 2050 through cement blended 
and improving ammonia plants with advanced technology. The TRNS assumed 
mitigation potentials of unconditional NDC will be increased by adding more 
mitigation actions such as : (i) installing N O emissions destruction in nitric acid 
2
industries, (ii) using lower PFCs (CF /C F ) emissions technology in aluminium 
4 2 6
6 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)productions, and (iii) utilizing scrap and low carbon emitting technology in iron 
and steel production. The LCCP may be realized by maximizing all mitigation 
potentials which were included in the CPOS and TRNS.
Unlike other sectors, all three scenarios in IPPU shows increasing emissions 
from 2010-2050 but with lowering rate of increase from CPOS to TRNS and to 
LCCP. The GHG emission in 2050 will reach 70 Mton CO2e for CPOS,   66 Mton 
CO e for TRNS, and 50.2 Mton CO e in 2050 for LCCP.
2 2
1.2. Adaptation 
Indonesia’s climate resilient pathway reflects the importance of synergy between 
adaptation and mitigation. Climate resilience and low carbon development 
requires  environmental  development  with  economic  perspectives  and 
economic development with environmental constrains, taking into account 
their social dimensions. 
By extending adaptation strategy in Updated NDC, the adaptation 
pathways set the goal to reduce the impact of climate change on 
national GDP loss by 3.45% in 2050, through increasing resilience 
in four basic necessities (food, water, energy, and environmental 
health), with three target areas of resilience (economy, social and 
livelihood, ecosystem and landscape)
The economic resilience is manifested in the form of long-term investments 
based on risk codes such as climate hotspots, climate vulnerability, sectoral 
and regional-based adaptive development. Equally, the social and livelihoods 
resilience is translated into enhancement of human resource capacity and 
creation of green job opportunities. Likewise, the ecosystem and landscape 
resilience are directed towards sustainable landscape management through 
integrated terrestrial and marine ecosystem management and conservation. 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  7
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)Regional  and  sectoral  approaches  were  used  in 
developing  climate  resilient  pathways.  The  Regional 
Pathway  focuses  on  priority  areas  to  implement 
adaptation actions based on several basic necessities 
(food, water, energy, and environmental health), taking 
consideration  the  following  aspects:  climate,  climate 
sensitive,  non-climate  sensitive,  and  social  economy. 
Adaptation  actions  under  the  Sectoral  Pathway  also 
based on the same basic necessities as the Regional 
Pathway. Synergy between ministries/sectoral agencies 
as prerequisites for the successful of the implementation 
of the long-term strategy on climate resilience will be part 
of the key enabling environments to be strengthened 
over time.

CONDITION AND 
DEVELOPMENT 
OBJECTIVES
2.1.  Introduction
Indonesia  is  an  archipelagic  country  with 
total areas of 7.81 million square kilometres 
where  marine  area  occupies  about  74.3% 
of  the  country  territory,  with  the  second 
longest coastal line in the world of about 95.2 
thousand kilometres (BIG, 2018). Located in 
tropical zone between two continents (Asia 
and  Australia)  and  two  Oceans  (India  and 
Pacific),  Indonesia  is  blessed  with  mega-
biodiversity, featuring a combination of Asian 
and Australasian biodiversity, and acting as a 
meeting point between the two continents.  
About 64% of the country land area (~120.6 
Mha) is designated as forest area (Kawasan 
Hutan)  and  divided  into  production  forest 
(~68.8 Mha, including convertible forest ~12.8 
Mha1),  protection  forest  (~29.7  Mha),  and 
conservation forest (~22.1 Mha).

INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  11
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)Indonesia’s position across the equator brings about high and relatively uniform 
temperature. Furthermore, its location between Asia and Australia landmasses 
also exposes Indonesia to monsoon storms. Variation in regional temperature 
is influenced by elevation rather than altitude. The highest temperature can 
be experienced in the coastal areas and the lowest temperature in the highest 
altitude. Mean annual temperature ranges between 20 – 30oC, however, the 
temperature may reach as high as 38oC and drop to the lowest one of 18oC.
Population has increased from 119.21 million in 1971 to 258.50 million in 2016 
(Statistics Indonesia, 2018) with an average annual growth rate of 1.98% from 
1980 to 1990 and 1.36% from 2010 to 2016 (Statistic Indonesia, 2017). Statistic 
Indonesia (2020) recorded that the current population is 270.2 million with 
annual growth rate 1.25% from 2012-2020 or slows down compared to annual 
growth rate between 2000-2010 of 1.49%.  Statistic Indonesia (2018) projected 
that the population will reach 296.4 million by 2030 with an average annual 
growth rate of 0.98%. Indonesia anticipates both opportunities and challenges 
with projected population growth rate of 0.74 percent annually from 2015 to 
2045,  reaching 318.95 million in 2045. It is estimated that by 2050 Indonesian’s 
population will reach approximately 335 million.
2.2.  Economic, Social, and Environment 
Development 
In line with National Long-Term Development Plan (RPJPN) 2005-2025, the  
National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) 2020-2024 is aimed at 
achieving ‘independent - developed - just - prosper’ communities, through 
acceleration of development with emphasize on strong economic structure 
based on competitive advantages of regions, supported by human resources 
with high qualities and competitive ability. RPJMN 2020-2024 is implemented 
under the four following pillars : (i) Established institutions of politics and laws, 
(ii)  Community  welfare  continuously  improve,  (iii)  Developed  and  durable 
12 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)economic structure, and (d) Sustainably managed biodiversity. With these 
four  pillars,  seven  development  agenda  of  RPJMN  2020-2024  have  been 
set up to guide the development agenda at the national and sub-national 
levels, namely : (i) Strengthening economic resilience for quality growth, (ii) 
Regional  development  to  reduce  inequality  among  region,  (iii)  Enhancing 
human resources’ quality and competitiveness, (iv) Building national culture 
and character, (v ) Improving infrastructure to support economic development 
and basic services, (vi) Development of environment, increasing resilience to 
disaster and climate change, and (vii) Strengthening stability of politic-law-
national security and transformation of public services. 
GDP has grown from 4.0% at the first quarter 2015 to 5.03% on average during 
the period from 2015-2019, with the highest growth rate of 5.17% in 2018 and the 
lowest one of 4.88% in 2015. The 2019 GDP growth rate was also high (5.02%) 
although slightly lower than the growth rate in 2018. Under the RPJMN 2020-
2024, Indonesia has targeted to achieve GDP growth of 5.6 - 6.2% in 2024. 
However, COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in negative GDP growth of 2.07% in 
2020. Although Indonesia has set up an optimistic scenario for 2021 national 
GDP growth, there remains high uncertainty on the global economic recovery 
which will in turn influence the national economic recovery. 
2.3. Towards National Resilience
Effective implementation of the RPJMN 2020-2024 will be a strong foundation 
to achieve the vision of One Hundred Years Indonesia (Visi Indonesia 2045) 
towards a developed and prosperous Indonesia and the goals of the LTS-LCCR. 
The four following pillars of the ‘Visi Indonesia 2045’ guide further elaboration 
for their translations into policies and programmes : 
Pillar 1.  Human  resource  development  and  science  and  technology 
advancement,  to  increase  human  resource  quality  through 
enhanced education, strong cultural values, improved health 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  13
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)and quality of life, enhanced productivity and advanced science 
and technology capacity, and wider employment opportunity. 
Pillar 2.  Sustainable economic development, to transform to a developed 
and strong economic country, driven by investment and trade, 
industry and creative economy, tourism, maritime, and services; 
supported by well-developed infrastructure, food resilience and 
farmer’s welfare, water and energy resilience, and commitment 
on environment and low carbon development.
Pillar 3.  Equitable  development,  to  ensure  fair  earnings  opportunity 
across social-economic conditions, reduce gaps in development 
among regions, and infrastructure integration and distribution 
across regions. 
Pillar 4. Strengthening national resilience and public sector governance, 
with  improved  quality  of  democracy,  institutional  and 
bureaucracy reform, enhanced national law and anti-corruption 
system, implementation of non-alignment international politics, 
and sound national defence and security.  
As a unity state, with a decentralised democratic governance system, Indonesia 
has applied an integral comprehensive and holistic policy in maintaining and 
enhancing national resilient, which – in nature - requires inter-regional, inter 
sectoral and multi-disciplinary approaches.  
In line with Indonesia’s constitution which emphasizes the state obligation to 
guarantee decent life and healthy environment for all citizens, in Article 28H,  
Indonesia’s commitment to the  Paris Agreement has been translated into 
the ratification of the Paris Agreement with the highest regulatory instrument 
(Law), implementation of NDC with its update and detail road maps for the 
implementation, as well as development of Long-Term Strategy for low carbon 
and climate resilience 2050.

ADAPTATION 
AMBITION
3.1.  Global Challenges
Climate change is one of the global issues 
that  has  become  a  common  concern  of 
humankind in recent years. Climate change 
became an important topic because it poses 
significant risks to different regions, sectors, 
and population. One of the global challenges 
in climate change is to reduce the emissions 
of greenhouse gases (GHGs), the major factor 
of global warming that affects climate change. 
In 2050, the atmospheric concentrations of 
GHGs  could  reach  685  ppm  with  increase 
50% of GHGs emission projection due to 70% 
growth in energy-related CO  emission. The 
2
projection  result  show  that  global  average 
temperature  increase  to  between  3ºC  and 
6ºC above pre-industrial levels by the end of 
century. It means, the projection is exceeding 
Paris Agreement’s goal for limiting it to 2ºC. 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  17
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)In most scenarios, without mitigation effort even with adaptation, atmospheric 
concentration by 2100 is more than 1,000 ppm CO e. Emission scenarios 
2
of CO e concentrations in 2100 of about ≤ 450 ppm are likely to maintain 
2
warming below 2ºC. These scenarios projected that in 2050 the GHG emission 
reduction will reach 40% to 70% compared to 2010 (49 ± 4.5 Gton CO e per 
2
year) and 2100 emissions level will reach near zero or below. In model pathways 
with no or limited overshoot of 1.5°C, global net anthropogenic CO  emissions 
2
decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 (40–60% interquartile range), 
reaching net-zero around 2050 (2045–2055 interquartile range). For limiting 
global warming to below 2°C, CO  emissions are projected to decline by about 
2
20% by 2030 in most pathways (10–30% interquartile range) and reach net-zero 
around 2075 (2065–2080 interquartile range). Non-CO  emissions in pathways 
2
that limit global warming to 1.5°C show deep reductions that are similar to 
those in pathways limiting warming to 2°C (IPCC SR1.5).
By 2050, the Earth’s population is estimated over 9 billion with growing demand 
for energy and natural resources. Environmental degradation and erosion 
of natural resources are expected to continue to 2050, with the irreversible 
changes that will endanger life and livelihood. Without ambitious policy, the 
world will face more disruptive climate change as a result of the increase of 
GHGs emission by 50% to 70% due to growth of energy-related CO  emission. 
2
These  increased  emissions  will  cause  temperature  increase  above  2ºC 
threshold, affect precipitation patterns, increase glacier and permafrost melt, 
increase sea-level, and worsen the intensity and frequency of extreme weather 
events. It is projected that in 2050 biodiversity loss will continue, mature 
forests will shrink in area by 13% followed by commercial forestry, while mean 
species abundance will decrease by 10%. The availability of clean water will be 
increasingly scarce in many regions with over 40% of global population living 
in river basins while global water demands is projected to increase. Urban and 
agriculture wastewater is projected to worsen in most regions, air pollution, 
transport congestion, and waste management could be exacerbated by 2050 
due to almost 70% of the world’s population is projected to live in urban areas.
18 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)3.2.  National Challenges
The IPCC has stated that Global Warming will have an impact on various 
aspects of the economy and development, especially in developing countries, 
including Indonesia. As the largest archipelagic country with extensive low-
lying and small island areas Indonesia is one of the most vulnerable countries 
to the negative impacts of climate change. Indonesia faces the risk of losing 
small islands and the narrowing of its coastal areas due to rising sea levels 
that will threaten cities located on the coastline. The increase in Sea Surface 
Temperature (SST) will affect changes in the migration pathways of fish and 
other  sea  creatures,  coral  bleaching,  loss  and  damage  to  mangrove  and 
seagrass ecosystems, as well as imbalance of marine mammal populations. 
Based on data in Country Report (2017), in 2008 and 2009 the sea level rise 
increase of up to 0.8 m resulted in sea waters penetrating the coast up to 
several kilometres in the Cirebon area with an estimated loss of more than IDR 
1.29 trillion per ha per year. An increase in sea level rise of 0.01 m per year is also 
projected to flood more than 1.7 thousand hectares of the Semarang Coastal 
area in 2030 with an estimated economic loss of IDR 6.1 trillion. In addition, 
the occurrence of high tides of up to 200 cm will trigger tidal flooding in the 
northern area of   Jakarta and cause losses of more than IDR 4.7 trillion.
Decadal variability affects the average temperature conditions in Indonesia. 
In 30 years (1991-2020), various regions in Indonesia have experienced an 
increase in temperature. The rate of increase in temperature varied across 
locations, between 0.01oC and 0.06oC per year, with an average of 0.03oC each 
year. In 30 years, the temperature has increased by around 0.9oC. During the 
last 30 years (1981-2010), the dominant trend of decadal rainfall showed an 
upward trend due to drier rainfall conditions in the early 1980s and 1990s as 
a result of the strong and moderate El-Nino events in those years, and wetter 
conditions in the late 2000s where strong La-Nina occurred in 2010.
Sea  Surface  Temperature  in  Indonesia’s  territory  ranges  from  0.8oC-1.5oC 
per 100 years if calculated from 1945, slightly higher than the global average 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  19
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)but  comparable to the trend of global temperature increase of 0.78 ± 0.18oC 
(IPCC, 2007). The increase in SST in Java, Banda, Arafura and most seas in 
Eastern Indonesia is relatively high compared to the increase in SST in the 
South China Sea which is only 0–0.25oC. The low increase in SST in the South 
China Sea may be caused by upwelling and freshwater flux from rivers and 
rain. Furthermore, the low increase in SST in southern Java and Sumatera was 
more due to intensive upwelling as a result of the high frequency of El Nino 
compared to La Nina from 1982 to mid-2000. Meanwhile, the increase in SST 
on the southern coast of Java in the east, south of Bali, Lombok and the islands 
of Nusa Tenggara relatively high due to warm water transport from the Pacific 
Ocean through the Makassar, Banda and Timor Strait.
According to the global atlas issued by the IPCC 2013, Indonesia is projected 
to experience an increase in air temperature of up to 2oC in major islands by 
2100. Based on the analysis, the extreme temperature changes in 2021-2050 
under the projection of RCP 4.5 CSIRO MIROC occur in Riau, South Sumatra, 
Lampung, the northern coast of Java, West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, 
and Papua. The temperature extremes range between 28oC and 30oC. Rainfall 
is projected to experience an anomalous increase in monthly rainfall that 
exceeds 200 mm/month. The RCP4.5 scenario with the 25th, 50th and 75th 
percentile of the CMIP5 ensemble distribution shows that annual rainfall can 
decrease by 20%, especially in the southern region for the 2016-2035 period. 
Rainfall is projected to increase by up to 20%, especially in the northern and 
eastern parts of the region (Kalimantan and Papua) for the periods 2046-2065 
and 2081-2100. Increase in SST is a direct consequence of an increase in 
surface air temperature. 
20 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)3.3.  Role of Ocean and Integrated Terrestrial 
and Marine Ecosystem Management and 
Conservation
Global climate change models have predicted that Indonesia will experience an 
increase in temperature, intensity of rainfall that will increase the risk of floods 
and droughts, and extended dry seasons. Indonesia has already experienced 
extreme climate events such as floods and drought, and is anticipating long-
term impacts from sea level rise.
Increasing sea temperature caused by climate change in a coral reef area will 
threaten the coral life in the form of massive coral bleaching. In general, coral 
reefs can optimally grow in temperature between 26°C and 30°C. However, 
an increase of SST between 1°C and 2°C from mean annual value can trigger 
coral bleaching. Coral bleaching has significant impacts on fish population, as 
it is the habitat of thousands of species of reef fish. In addition, the reef also 
functions as a high energy and wave absorber that reduces the risks of coastal 
erosion. Therefore, damage to reefs increases the risk of coastal erosion.
Studies on SST within the period 1889-2014 showed the tendency of increasing 
trend up to 0.5oC in several of Indonesian marine areas2. The average SST is 
projected to increase by 0.65°C in 2030, 1.10°C in 2050, 1.70°C in 2080, and 2.15°C 
in 2100 relative to the SST in 2000. The increasing SST and decreasing salinity 
of sea water will also affect the growth rate of coral reefs, and the mortality will 
increase. The results of COREMAP monitoring in 2019 showed that the status of 
coral reef ecosystems was distinguished by 33.82% were in the bad category, 
37.38% were in the moderate category, 22.38% were in the good category, and 
only 6.42% were in the very good category. Several studies suggested indication 
of sea level rise up to 0.8 m in a number of sea areas in Indonesia for the last 
century, such as in Java Island and eastern part of Indonesia. The more frequent 
extreme climate events will trigger an increase in sea level rise in the future3.

FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)This  climate-related  evidence  suggested  the  important  role  of  ocean  in 
adaptation to climate change and Indonesia has included ocean in adaptation 
component  of  the  NDC.  The  National  Medium-Term  Plan  (RPJMN)  2020-
2024 has put adaptation in coastal and fishery through coastal protection 
programmes, which is in-line with NDC. 
Along with the global research progress on the role of ocean in climate change 
mitigation, research on this area has been initiated in Indonesia, including blue 
carbon (marine ecosystem, consisting of mangroves, seagrass and coral reefs). 
Mangrove has been included in the national GHGs inventory under wetland 
category as well as in the establishment of Forest Reference Emission Level 
(FREL) for REDD+ and so does in the estimation of REDD+ results. Seagrass also 
can absorb carbon as well. Furthermore, a study recorded carbon sequestration 
from seagrass ecosystem meadows in Indonesia ranges from 1.6-7.4 Mton C 
per year.
Some  regulatory  frameworks  which  can  be  the  basis  for  ocean-based 
adaptation and mitigation have been in place, for example Law No. 27/2007 on 
Coastal Zone Management, Law No.31/2004 on Fishery (amended with Law No 
45/2009), and more recently Government Regulation No 32/2019 on Ocean 
Spatial Planning, which clearly states the role of ocean and its associated 
ecosystems in climate change adaptation and mitigation. 
As the country that has ratified the three Rio Conventions (UNFCCC, CBD, 
and UNCCD), Indonesia also foresees synergy effects of these Conventions 
in realizing integrated terrestrial and marine ecosystem management and 
conservation. Through this synergic implementation, Indonesia will increase 
climate resilience, reduce vulnerability and exposure, and adapt to climate 
change, as well as deliver emission reduction. 
Beyond the role of ocean natural ecosystems in climate change adaptation and 
mitigation, Indonesia’s ocean provides logistic services to connect all islands. 
Ocean is also part of culture, socio economic life, in particular for people who 
22 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)live in remote areas and small islands. Moreover, ocean is also part of national 
security and resilience. Coastal and marine based activities have also been part 
of COVID-19 recovery programme, including 15 thousands hectare mangrove 
planting and 50 hectare coral reef restoration in marine tourism area in Bali in 
2020.
3.4.  Framework on Climate Change Actions in 
Indonesia
The main policy that deals with environmental issues in Indonesia is Law No. 
32/2009  on  Protection  and  Management  of  Environment,  which  strongly 
emphasizes the effect of climate change on the environment. Indonesia’s 
commitment to tackle climate change impacts is also reflected in the ratification 
of the Paris Agreement through Law No. 16/2016. Government Regulation 
No. 46/2016 on Strategic Environmental Assessment (KLHS) as one of the 
translation of Law No. 32/2009 and one of strong basis to implement Law No. 
16/2016 has guided part of the substantive elements of Ministerial Regulations 
(Minister  for  Environment  and  Forestry)  which  deal  with  climate  change, 
including Ministerial Regulations (Minister for Environment and Forestry) No. 
33/2016, No. 19/2016 and No. 7/2018. 
Ministerial  Regulation  (Minister  for  Environment  and  Forestry)  No.33/2016 
provides guidance for national governments and local governments in planning 
climate change adaptation actions and integrating them into development 
plans of specific regions and/or sectors. Furthermore, Ministerial Regulation 
(Minister  for  Environment  and  Forestry)  No.  7/2018  provides  guidance  for 
national and local government (and general society) on: a) determining the 
scope of the analysis, selection of methods, indicators, indicator data, and data 
sources for formulating vulnerability, risk and impact assessments of climate 
change; and b) determining the criteria for verification of vulnerability, risk, 
and climate change impact assessment results. In addition, the vulnerability 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  23
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)component should cover climate-related hazards, exposure, sensitivity and 
adaptive  capacity  in  accordance  with  standard  practice.  Climate  Village 
Programme  (PROKLIM)  has  been  continuously  improved,  including  by 
transforming the PROKLIM become national movement on joint adaptation 
and mitigation which aims at increasing understanding on climate change and 
its impacts and to encourage the implementation of adaptation and mitigation 
actions at the local level through Minister Regulation (Minister of Environment 
and Forestry) No. 84/2016. Furthermore, some Ministerial Regulations relating 
to strategic environmental assessment (KLHS) were also put into effect far 
before and after the issuance of Government Regulation on KLHS, such as 
Minister Regulation (Minister for Environment) No. 9/2011, Minister Regulation 
(Minister for Home Affairs) No. 67/2012, and Minister Regulation (Minister for 
Home Affairs) No. 7/2018. Figure 1 describes policy and regulatory frameworks 
which support climate change mitigation and adaptation.  
Figure 1. National policy and regulatory framework supporting climate change mitigation 
and adaptation
24 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)Adaptation and mitigation are two inextricable actions in responding to global 
climate change. The mitigation and adaptation strategy requires adequate and 
evolving efforts to achieve the target of holding global average temperature 
increase to well below 2oC and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature 
increase to 1.5oC above pre-industrial level. This means that mitigation activities 
will be able to achieve sustainability if they are integrated with adaptation 
measures. Integrating mitigation and adaptation measures can also increase 
local  people’s  acceptance  and  interest  in  mainstreaming  climate  change 
actions. This is because adaptation emphasizes the urgent needs of local 
communities, while mitigation has more long-term global benefits. Therefore, 
the greater the mitigation effort, the less adjusted impacts, and the less risk 
involved. Conversely, the greater the degree of adaptation preparedness, the 
less impact associated with a particular level of climate change. 
Climate change mitigation and adaptation cannot be seen as alternatives 
to  each  other,  because  they  are  not  independent  activities,  but  have  a 
complementary role in responding to climate change which is carried out at 
different spatial, temporal, and institutional scales (see Figure 2). If mitigation 
is successful in reducing greenhouse gas emissions substantially, the effects 
of climate change will continue because the lag time remains between the 
reduction in greenhouse gas concentrations and the reduction in the rate 
of warming. This means that adaptation is very important, regardless of the 
impact  of  mitigation.  However,  very  few  communities  at  the  grassroots 
level are aware of their vulnerabilities and risks. Therefore, the objectives of 
Indonesia’s  climate  change  adaptation  strategy  are  directed  at  reducing 
risks,  increasing  adaptive  capacity,  strengthening  resilience,  and  reducing 
vulnerability to climate change in all development sectors by 2030 through 
increasing climate literacy, strengthening local capacity, improving knowledge 
management,  policies  convergence  on  climate  change  adaptation 
and  disaster  risk  reduction,  and  the  application  of  adaptive  technology.

(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)IV. MITIGATION 
PATHWAYS
In the Indonesia First NDC, forest and other 
land uses (FOLU) and energy sectors are the 
main two sources of emission and have been 
targeted as the main sectors for meeting the 
NDC target. In the long-term, Indonesia needs 
to significantly reduce emission of its energy 
system to near zero and to change the land use 
and forestry to become net sink, so these will 
make the country possible to meet the Paris 
Agreement  Target.  It  means  that  Indonesia 
needs to transform its energy and land-use 
systems, which will address a large number 
of  targets  with  potential  trade-offs  among 
them. These include, inter alia, targets relating 
to energy security, food security, biodiversity 
and  deforestation,  freshwater  use,  nitrogen 
and  phosphorous,  and  competing  uses  for 
lands.  For  example,  strategies  to  curb  net 
greenhouse gas emissions by using biofuels 
may  generate  negative  impacts  on  food 
security, biodiversity, and other environmental 
objectives. 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  29
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)On the other hand, the transformation will also exhibit major international spill-
overs. Indonesia may take large-scale afforestation/reforestation and forest 
conservation to meet its climate goals but its dependence on food import 
may increase. This will have major implications in other countries to increase 
the commodity exports to Indonesia and these may also cause an increase 
in emission of the exporting countries. In developing the Indonesia LTS-LCCR 
2050, Indonesia elaborates the long-term strategy for transformation towards 
Paris Agreement target by taking these issues into account.
4.1.  Scenario Development
4.1.1. Models for Mitigation Pathways
Indonesia used a set of models in developing the emission pathways with 
two stages of analysis. In the first stage, separate models were developed for 
modelling agriculture, forestry and other land uses (AFOLU), and energy. The 
AFOLU sector used AFOLU Dashboard (a spreadsheet model), meanwhile 
energy sector used AIM-EndUse and the AIM-ExSS (Extended Snapshoot). In 
both models, economic and population growth are the key drivers for changes 
in food and energy demand. In the second stage, the economic and economic 
impact of both AFOLU and energy sector mitigation are analysed by utilizing 
the Asia Pacific Integrated Model/Computable General Equilibrium (AIM/CGE)-
Indonesia (see Figure 3).

30 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)The AFOLU Dashboard model was designed to analyse future land demands 
and land uses under different sets of development scenarios and estimated 
greenhouse gas emission related to the land use changes under the scenarios. 
The  model  simulates  the  change  in  land  uses  based  on  the  change  in 
development activities for meeting the demand of people for settlements, food 
and wood and also animal for feed as well as government target for producing 
agriculture commodities for exports. As the population increases, the demand 
for settlement, food, wood and feed also increases which will drive the change 
in land uses. The food consumption pattern changes with GDP as well as the 
level of food loss and waste. The capacity of land for producing the commodity 
depends  upon  crop/plant  productivities  and  cropping  intensity/land  use 
efficiency. The changes of land use in the future therefore depends on the 
change in assumption on a combination of drivers, including population and 
GDP growth, livestock/animal population growth, crops productivity, cropping 
intensity, feed and food consumption level and production target for some 
key strategic commodities. The change in land use and land management will 
trigger the greenhouse gases emission and removal. The level of the emission 
and the removal can be controlled by mitigation technologies. Figure 4 shows 
the structure of the AFOLU Dashboard.
Figure 4. AFOLU Dashboard 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  31
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)The AFOLU Dashboard was used to forecast food production, food consumption, 
food trade balance, and land use for food, bioenergy and industrial needs 
and GHG emission from agriculture and land use by 2050. Production and 
consumption grow in line with economic and population growth. The model also 
takes into account changes in food loss and waste along with the development 
of post-harvest technology and consumption behaviour. The outputs from the 
AFOLU Dashboard, namely agricultural commodity production and land use, 
were then be used as inputs to the CGE model. 
The AIM/CGE-Indonesia model is a multisectoral, recursive dynamic model 
that  will  project  the  economic  and  environmental  impact  of  any  policy 
implementation at the national level. The input from AFOLU models influence 
production block and restrict land use. Meanwhile, outputs from the ExSS 
model provide basic data on energy supply. The CGE model results will be 
used to calculate impact of mitigation action to macroeconomic, sectoral, and 
environment.
The  AIM-ExSS  model  is  used  to  estimate  rational  projections  of  energy 
demand (electricity) by the user side (industrial, commercial, residential, and 
transportation). The power sector development is derived by the demand 
of electricity while the types of power generation are selected based on the 
costs and/or benefits, and also various issues related to energy supply security, 
investment climates, impacts to the economic growth, climate change, and 
sustainable development goals. The output from supply-side energy sector 
and price of energy will be used as inputs in CGE model.
4.1.2. Mitigation Scenario
Indonesia Low Carbon and Climate Resilience Scenario (LCCR) towards 2050 
has three development pathways. The three pathways include: (i) current policy 
scenario (CPOS), (ii) transition scenario (TRNS) and (iii) low carbon scenario 
compatible with Paris Agreement target (LCCP). CPOS is a scenario that follows 
the unconditional scenario of the NDC, while transition scenario is a scenario 
32 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)that bridge transition from the CPOS to LCCP. AFOLU sector only considers two 
pathways, i.e. CPOS and LCCP.
In the non-AFOLU sectors (energy, IPPU and waste), the CPOS is the extend of 
unconditional NDC, in which the GHG emissions level in 2050 is estimated by 
projecting the unconditional GHG emissions in 2030 to 2050 with assumptions 
that  mitigation  and  policies  under  unconditional  NDC  are  extended  until 
2050. The TRNS is development scenario in the transition period toward the 
development pathway compatible with the Paris Agreement. In this scenario, 
the emission reduction of the unconditional NDC beyond 2030 is enhanced by 
adding more mitigation actions but less progressive than the LCCP.
In the AFOLU sector, the CPOS is also the continuation of policies and measures 
under unconditional NDC. The LCCP implements more progressive mitigation 
actions with the aim to reduce the emission significantly reaching net sink 
by 2050 that make the emission level of all sectors compatible with Paris 
Agreement target. The emission pathway of AFOLU sector presented in the 
TRNS is the same as the emission pathway of the LCCP.
Under LCCP, it is indicated that this scenario will have emission pathway which 
much lower than the CPOS and TRNS (see Figure 5). In the CPOS and TRNS, 
the peak of emission will not be reached until 2050. In the CPOS, the emission 
will increase rapidly after 2030 and it will reach 2,454 Mton CO e or about 7.33 
2
ton CO e per capita in 2050. Whereas in the TRNS, the increase of the emission 
2
after 2030 is much slower than that of CPOS and it will reach 1,526 Mton CO e 
2
or about 4.56 ton CO e per capita in 2050.  Under LCCP, the emission will 
2
decrease rapidly after 2030 reaching 540 Mton CO e in  2050 or equivalent to 
2
about 1.61 ton CO e per capita.

CPOS TRNS LCCP
Figure 5. Projection of emission under the CPOS, TRNS and LCCP
Of the three development pathways, it is indicated that the mitigation actions 
of the CPOS are far from sufficient to meet the Paris Agreement target, due 
to continues increase of emission after 2050. The TRNS gives much higher 
emission reduction than that of CPOS, but the reduction will not be sufficient 
to reach the emission level in 2050 which is compatible with Paris Agreement 
target. With very progressive mitigation actions under LCCP, the emission 
level is expected to be compatible with Paris Agreement target. In this 
scenario, after 2030 the emission decrease at a rate of about 30.7 Mton 
CO e per year. If this decreasing rate of the emission can be maintained  
2
beyond 2050, Indonesia is expected to gain optimistically opportunity for  
more rapid progress towards net-zero emission in 2060 or sooner.
34 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)4.2. Low Carbon and Climate Resilience Scenario 
In-depth sectoral transformation plans require strong political will, coordination, 
specific analytical resource and expertise with significant public and private 
sector  collaboration.  Enhancement  of  the  institutional  capabilities  and 
arrangements for the planning and policy-making processes is critical, as 
the sectors need to plan detailed actions over several time scales and ensure 
the right change can take place in the right way. The institutional capabilities 
for  these  planning  efforts  and  their  implementation  will  require  improved 
capabilities, as well as closer links to the research community, civil society, and 
the business community.
For the success of transformation, sequence of steps for the implementation 
of  low  carbon  development  compatible  with  the  Paris  Agreement  target 
should be mapped into the existing institutional framework in order to identify 
current coordination arrangements and the needs for adjustments. These 
will be pathways of transformation spanning 30 years that require multi-step 
processes and should be mapped out in somewhat detailed sequence. Issues 
relating to ministerial attributions, levels of government, chains of command, 
and decision-making, as well as the scope for different institutions to access 
resources such as finance, skills, or regulatory authorization, should all be 
taken into consideration. In addition, training and capacity building as well as 
infrastructure and skills to support the transition at the national and sub-national 
level is required.
4.2.1. Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses 
(AFOLU)
Indonesia has carried out many efforts to meet the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) and the objectives of the Paris Agreement. A number of innovative 
policies and measures (PaMs) have been issued to transform food and land-use 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  35
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)systems to curb greenhouse gas emissions, conserve and restore biodiversity, 
promote healthy diets, ensure rural livelihoods, adapt to climate change, and 
meet other environmental constraints, including sustainable use of freshwater 
resources and reducing pollutants as well as halting the loss of marine and 
coastal  ecosystem  services.  PaMs  are  directed  to  reduce  deforestation 
either planned and un-planned (illegal deforestation) and forest degradation, 
accelerating  reforestation  and  restoration  of  peat  ecosystem,  improving 
agriculture productivity and land use efficiency, reducing food loss and waste 
and improving diets and food diversification and access. 
Indonesia has committed through REDD+ to maintain the remaining natural 
forest.  Policies  that  have  been  issued  include  (i)  permanent  extension  of 
the  forest  and  peatland  moratoriums  (Presidential  Instruction  5/2019);  (ii) 
implementation of mandatory certification for sustainable forest management; 
(iii) integrated, comprehensive, spatially explicit land use planning at national 
and sub-national level guided by the Government Regulation 46/2016 on 
strategic  environmental  assessments  (SEAs)  through  landscape  approach 
aiming at securing food, water, and energy security based on sound ecosystem 
management; (iv) establishment of new financial models for conservation 
and restoration in sustainable jurisdictions with the issuance of Government 
Regulation No. 46/2017 on Environmental economic instrument and other 
fiscal incentives; and (v) establishment of Indonesia Environmental Fund (Badan 
Pengelola Dana Lingkungan Hidup /BPDLH) through Presidential Regulation No. 
77/2018 concerning Management of Environmental Fund. Indonesia is also in 
the process of issuing another innovative policy on economic value of carbon.
BPDLH will manage funds related to forestry, energy and mineral resources, 
carbon trading, environmental services, industry, transportation, agriculture, 
marine and fisheries, and other fields related to the environment. The goal 
is to be able to manage funds more optimally and synergistically, as well as 
optimise the use of funds and mobilise funding resources both domestic and 
international sources. This agency is guided by principles of transparency and 
accountability and meets international governance standards.
36 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)For increasing agriculture productions to meet the future domestic and global 
demand without significantly increase the demand for land, Indonesia also 
put significant efforts to boost productivity and increase land use efficiency 
and to optimise use of unproductive lands (idle lands). It will create better and 
more productive agricultural value chains, increase and improve access of 
small holders to market, reduce loss and waste of food, and improve diets and 
food diversification and access. The presence of these PaMs provides good 
foundation for implementing low carbon development compatible with the Paris 
Agreement target. Effective implementation of these PaMs could bring AFOLU 
sector become a net sink by 2050 under CPOS and by 2030 under LCCP (see 
Figure 6). However, the presence of international support will be fundamental 
to realize these PaMs as this require more investment and technology as well as 
capacity building.
  
Figure 6. Emission pathways under CPOS and LCCP 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  37
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)The emission pathways in CPOS will continue to decline and will reach near 
zero emission by 2050, while for the LCCP it will turn into negative emission 
(net sink). In both scenarios, the significant reduction of emission occurs due 
to significant decrease in deforestation and peat related emission (peat fire and 
peat decomposition), and significant increase in carbon sequestration from 
secondary forest and from afforestation and reforestation. 
4.2.1.1. Forestry and Other Land Uses
Efforts to significantly reduce the emission of this sector and turn it into net 
sink by 2050 under CPOS and by 2030 under LCCP depends primarily on the 
success of the following actions: (i) reducing emission from deforestation and 
peatland (peat decomposition and peat fire); (ii) increasing the capacity of 
natural forest in sequestering carbon (by reducing degradation and enhancing 
the regeneration); (iii) restoring peatland, (iv) implementing forest restoration 
(enrichment  planting/sink  enhancement),  (v)  adopting  sustainable  forest 
management practices; and (vi) maximizing the use of unproductive lands (idle 
lands) for the establishment of forest and agriculture plantations (see Figure 6). 
a. Avoiding Deforestation 
Indonesia’s land cover area is about 187.8 Mha, and about 120.3 Mha is defined 
as forest area and the remaining as non-forest area commonly called as “other 
land uses” or Area Penggunaan Lain-APL (MoEF 2018). Some of these lands are 
categorised as peatland with a total area of 14.9 Mha.
The total area covered by the natural forest in 2020 was about 90.1 Mha (48.0%), 
which is about 6.5 Mha in APL and 83.6 Mha in a forest area. Out of 83.6 Mha, 
about 6.4 Mha are in convertible production forest, meaning that this forested 
land can be converted for other land uses in the future and will be subjected 
to deforestation. Some of the non-forested land in forest areas are occupied by 
communities for agriculture activities (permanent or slash and burnt practices), 
and some remain as unproductive lands (shrubs and grassland or abandoned 
land).
38 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)To  avoid  further  conversion  of  forest,  Indonesia  has  issued  a  number  of 
regulations. Some of key regulations are: 
1.  Government Regulation No.104/2015 on the changes of forest land use 
and function, which ban the conversion of forested land (productive 
production forest) in forest area for APL, except in the province where the 
non-forested lands in the production forest are not available; 
2.  Presidential  Instruction  No.  5/2019  on  Termination  of  New  Permit  and 
Improvement of Primary Natural Forest and Peatland Governance; and 
3.  Government  Regulation  No.  46/2016  on  strategic  environmental 
assessments  (SEAs),  which  provide  guidance  on  the  integrated, 
comprehensive, spatially explicit land use planning at national and sub-
national level aiming at food, water, and energy security based on sound 
ecosystem management. 
In the National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) 2020-2024, forest 
area that need to be protected based on the value of ecosystem services of 
the forest, are expanded from 51.8 Mha to 65.3 Mha, which are located inside 
and outside forest area. This has to be considered in the process of developing 
land use planning at sub-national level. 
The CPOS and LCCP indicate that expected cumulative area to be deforested 
in the future are about 14.6 Mha and 6.8 Mha respectively (see Figure 7).
Figure 7. Expected forest conversion in the two scenarios
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  39
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)LCCP which requires future deforestation to be limited to 6.8 Mha to bring this 
sector becoming net sink also faces some challenges. Many concession areas 
(timber plantation and estate crop plantation) and non-concession areas in APL 
are covered by natural forest. There are more than 9.8 Mha of natural forests in 
the concessions and APL. By regulation about 50% of this area are not fall under 
the protection zone, thus allowed to be used for establishing the plantations and 
for development purposes. Without participation of concession companies 
and local governments, the area of the natural forest to be deforested in next    
30 years will be about 1.8 Mha. On the other hand, there are about 6.4 Mha  
of natural forest are in the convertible production forest. To meet the LCCP 
target, this forested convertible production forest area should not be converted 
for APL. Under the Government Regulation No. 104/2015, forested area in the 
convertible production forest can be changed to permanent production forest. 
Thus, the area of production forest that can be converted for APL are only the  
non-forested land.
Indonesia’s experience in achieving significant reduction of deforestation rate 
during the period of 2018 to 2020 can be a valuable lesson to address the 
above challenges.  Indonesia significantly reduced deforestation by about 75%, 
i.e. from 0.46 Mha in 2018/2019 to 0.12 Mha in 2019/2020. 
Under the implementation of REDD+, the local governments and concessions 
who can conserved the forest beyond the existing regulation, are eligible for 
receiving Result-based Payment (RBP) under the Ministerial Regulation (Minister 
for Environment and Forestry) No. 70/2017. In addition, Indonesia is also in the 
process of preparing innovative regulation related to fiscal incentive, as part of 
the implementation of Government Regulation No. 46/2017. 
b. Conservation and Sustainable Forest Management 
Government  Regulation  No.104/2015  provides  an  opportunity  to  increase 
forest area under protection zone, based on the value of ecosystem services 
of the area. Total area of forest under the protection zone at present is about 
51.8 Mha (i.e. conservation forest: 22.1 Mha, protection forest: 29.7 Mha) and 
40 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)under production zone is about 68.8 Mha. In the RPJMN 2020-2024, Indonesia 
has increased the area of forest under the protection zone to about 65 Mha, in 
which some of forest area under the production zone are allocated as protection 
zone. About 5.2 Mha forested lands allocated as the protection zone are in the 
concessions and in the APL.  
Reducing forest degradation due to excessive logging and encroachment in 
the production forests has been put as other priority. Indonesia has issued 
mandatory certification systems (Ministerial Regulation No. 30/ 2016 by the 
Minister of Environment and Forestry) that push the adoption of sustainable 
management practices in the production forests. With this policy, many forest 
concessions have improved their management practices. Under LCCP, by 
2050 all forest concession companies have implement sustainable harvesting 
practices. At present, the forest concessions that have received the good forest 
certification reach about 76%. 
Efforts to restore the degraded production forest through enhanced natural 
regeneration (ENR) or forest restoration will also be increased. It is expected 
that under LCCP, area of production forest that being restored through the 
ENR programme after 2030 should reach about 1.70 Mha, about 2 times of the 
CPOS, and by 2050 it will reach 8.8 Mha or about 6 times of the CPOS.
c. Protection and Restoration of Peatland 
Significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions has been released from the 
use of peatland through decomposition and peat fire. At present emission from 
these sources contribute to about 50% of the total emission from AFOLU sector. 
Indonesia has issued a number of key policies to protect peatland and improve 
its management. Under Presidential Instruction No. 5/2019, there will not be any 
new permit for the use of peatland. In addition, the Ministerial Regulation No. 
15/2017 (Minister for Environment and Forestry) mandates private sector and 
local governments to improve the use of peatland and water management. 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  41
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)Under CPOS, it is expected that the improvement of peatland and water 
management by 2030 and 2050 reaches 0.86 Mha and 1.04 Mha consecutively, 
while under LCCP it should reach 0.95 Mha by 2030 and 1.04 Mha by 2050. 
For peatland restoration, CPOS figures the area of degraded peatland being 
restored should reach 1.03 Mha by 2030 and 1.7 Mha by 2050. While under 
LCCP, the target will be increased to 2.7 Mha by 2030 and 4.2 Mha by 2050. 
d. Sink Enhancement 
Indonesia  will  accelerate  afforestation  and  reforestation  of  degraded  land 
inside and outside forest area as well as urban revegetation for increasing sink.   
At present many lands inside and outside forest areas are unproductive lands 
(Table 1). These lands are in the form of shrubs, grassland, and bare-lands. It is  
estimated that area of unproductive lands reaches almost 30.1 Mha and about     
26% of this land are considered as critical and very critical areas which urgently  
need to be rehabilitated. In addition, there are about 4.3 Mha lands in forest   
areas used by communities for agriculture activities (MoEF, 2019).

42 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)Under CPOS, Indonesia aims to rehabilitate the unproductive lands with priority 
in critical and very critical lands about 4.32 Mha by 2030 and 8.6 Mha by 
2050. Under the LCCP, this target is increased to 5.3 Mha by 2030 and 10.6 
Mha by 2050. Several programmes have been launched for accelerating the 
rehabilitation of the land, i.e. social forestry and land rehabilitation programmes 
and multi permit policies for forest concessions that allow to use the degraded 
lands for agriculture commodities in the form of agroforestry. 
4.2.1.2. Agriculture
Mitigation activity in agriculture sector is in indirect synergy with FOLU sector. 
The  success  of  the  implementation  of  FOLU  mitigation  depends  on  the 
agricultural conditions, where high planting intensity and improved productivity 
with support from advanced technology will reduce pressure on the forest and 
avoid forest conversion. At present, the agriculture sector contributes 18% of 
the emission for the AFOLU sector. The emission from this sector is expected 
to increase at a higher pace in CPOS than LCCP. The effort to reduce emissions 
in agriculture sector is emphasizing the presence of support on technology, 
finance and capacity development. 
The mitigation technologies accounted for in this sector are the adoption of 
low emission variety and water-saving paddy cultivation system (hereinafter 
referred to as SPR/STT) in the rice field, and utilization of livestock waste for 
biogas and livestock feed improvement in livestock management, and the 
reduction in using synthetic fertilizer.
a. Rice Field
Mitigation activities in the rice field are referring to the type of land system4. For 
the paddy field with continuous flooding, the mitigation action is to implement 
a low emission variety, while for the paddy field with proper water management, 
SPR/STT is the feasible option. 
Emission factors for paddy fields in Indonesia are varied, from a high emitted 
variety (e.g. Inpari and Cisadane) to a low emitted variety (e.g. Dodokan). In the 
case of continuous flooded land (high rainfall region with unavailable water 
4   Land system refers to low-land and up-land for rice paddy.
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  43
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)system), moving to low emission variety is more effective, as it is more difficult 
to manage the emission from water level. Under CPOS, the adoption of low 
emission variety is expected to be 0.93 Mha by 2030 and 1.96 Mha by 2050. 
Under LCCP, an ambitious target is set to 0.97 Mha by 2030 and 2.07 Mha by 
2050. The adoption scale approximately reaches 24% of the total rice field 
area by 2050. The main emphasis of the SPR/STT programme is to increase 
rice production with minimum input and improved water use efficiency (e.g. 
intermittent flooding) and organic fertilizer application. Currently, SPR/STT is 
implemented as a pilot activity and the attainment from the pilot programme 
will be replicated to the other region. By 2050, the technology programme is 
expected to be scaled up to 1.18 M ha and 1.31 M ha under CPOS and LCCP, 
respectively. 
b. Livestock
Demand for meat and milk will continue to increase following the increase of 
population and GDP. The current ruminant population in Indonesia is 43 million 
head and this will continue to increase following the historical trend. At present, 
Indonesia has imported meat and milk with increasing rate as the growth of 
meat production is lower than growth of meat consumption, and is anticipated 
to continue in the future. The mitigation actions comprise the utilization of 
livestock waste for biogas and improvement of livestock feed supplement. 
The CPOS and LCCP are setting a similar target for biogas implementation, 
accounted for 41,000 head in 2030 and 94,000 head in 2050. However, the 
number is considerably low compared to the national livestock population as 
this activity requires high investment for biodigester and flaring facility and 
continues supply of livestock waste. Hence, there is an urgency to design this 
activity to be more attractive for a large scale and communal husbandry. 
Research finds that shifting from high concentrate livestock feed to greenery 
feed,  specifically  in  beef  and  dairy  cattle,  is  potentially  reduce  methane 
emission from enteric fermentation. The feed supplement is a combination of 
the greenery and an additional feed supply of tannin from legume crops or 
44 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)urea molasses block. The target in CPOS and LCCP scenarios in 2050 is 3.42 
million head and 6.58 million head, respectively. 
c. The Use of Fertilizer
Applying organic fertilizer is expected to reduce dependency on nitrogen 
fertilizer usage. Cropland farmers are encouraged to use organic fertilizer 
to substitute the urea application. Under the assumed rate, urea dose under 
CPOS will be reduced from 0.1183 ton/ha in 2010 to 0.1174 ton/ha in 2050, while 
under LCCP will be reduced to 0.1172 ton/ha. The targeted land for this activity 
is cropland, which covers perennial, palm oil, rubber, rice, and other annual 
crops (e.g., vegetables, corn, casava) commodities. Under CPOS, the adoption 
of this mitigation action in 2030 and 2050 are expected to reduce the use 
of urea amounted to 3,089 ton and 58,513 ton, respectively. Under LCCP, the 
reduction of total urea used in 2030 and 2050 is expected to be 5,374 ton and 
65,697 ton, respectively.    
4.2.1.3. Achieving the Goals
Avoiding deforestation to certain target will have implication on other sectors 
since the demand for land will continue to increase as the population increases. 
In both scenarios (CPOS and LCCP), land uses and management choices leading 
to significant reduction of greenhouse emissions can achieve government 
target in maintaining rice self-sufficiency and export targets for several key 
agriculture commodities, particularly palm oil as well as industrial wood and 
bioenergy as defined in National Forestry Plan (RKTN), the Master Plan of Ministry 
of Agriculture, Road Map of APHI (Industrial Wood), and Road Map of GAPKI 
(Palm Oil). The strategy for avoiding deforestation while maintaining sectoral 
target is by improving crop productivity and cropping intensity, implementing 
integrated farming or complex agroforestry, optimizing the use of unproductive 
lands (idle lands) and reducing food loss and waste. 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  45
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)a. Improvement of Crop Productivity and Cropping Intensity
Increasing agricultural productivity and cropping intensity are key factors in 
meeting food demand in line with population and GDP growth, at the same 
time maintaining emission by reducing deforestation. This can be achieved by 
using high quality seeds, fertilizing, and adoption of agricultural technology. 
To achieve food security, efforts must be made to increase the productivity of 
staple foods such as rice, corn and others. Rice productivity in Java in 2010 was 
5.8 ton/ha and must increase by 12% in 2050 to 6.28 ton/ha in the CPOS and 
higher in the LCCP of 6.32 ton/ha. The rice productivity outside Java in 2010 is 
4.2 ton /ha and must increase by 33% in 2050 to 5.01 ton/ha under CPOS and 
5.2 ton/ha under LCCP. Increasing rice productivity in 2050 will be achieved by 
targeting growth of 5-10% in 2020-2030 and 9-12% in 2030-2050 (CPOS). The 
target for increasing rice productivity is higher in LCCP, namely 6-12% in 2020-
2050.
The  targets  for  increasing  the  optimal  productivity  for  other  agricultural 
commodities by 2050 is 8% (CPOS) and 22% (LCCP) for corn, 10% (CPOS) 
and 24% (LCCP) for vegetables, 27% (CPOS) and 48% (LCCP) for cassava, 74% 
(CPOS) and 95% (LCCP) for palm oil, 32% (CPOS) and 51% (LCCP) for sugar 
cane, 31% (CPOS and LCCP) for fruits and nuts, and 65% (CPOS and LCCP) for 
industrial crops. Under CPOS, the productivity target in 2050 are: (i) 4.62 ton/
ha for maize; (ii) 10.15 ton/ha for vegetables; (iii) 22.88 ton/ha for cassava; (iv) 
4.81 ton/ha for palm oil; (v) 6.12 ton/ha for sugar cane; (vi) 7.91 ton / ha for fruits 
and nuts; and (vii) 1.1 ton/ha for industrial crops. In the LCCP, the productivity 
target in 2050 are much higher: (i) 4.91 ton/ha for maize; (ii) 11.06 ton/ha for 
vegetables; (iii) 24.84 ton /ha for cassava; (iv) 5.32 ton/ha for palm oil; (v) 6.58 
ton/ha for sugar cane; (vi) 7.91 ton/ha for fruits and nuts; and (vii) 1.1 ton/ha for 
industrial crops.
Many  of  subsistence  farmers  are  cultivating  land  for  different  agriculture 
commodities in forest area, which is not allowed by regulation. Therefore, 
these subsistence farmers do not have access to government supports. By 
granting legal access through Social Forestry Programme, the farmers are 
46 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)eligible to receive supports from the government for the improvement of the 
farming activities by integrating the agriculture commodities with forest trees 
as agroforestry. Indonesia considers the Social Forestry Programme is a part 
of key solutions for addressing tenure issues and providing more access for 
community  to  utilise  forest  area  and  reducing  poverty.  The  reforestation 
using agroforestry system will be implemented with the participation of all 
stakeholders in a way that balances social and economy interests. Furthermore, 
Government provides land right to the farmers through agrarian reform (TORA 
Programme). With this policy, communities who have occupied land in forest 
area under TORA Programme for agriculture activities will have the ownership 
right and access to government supports as well as partnership with estate 
companies for yield improvement and market. 
The rice cropping intensity in Java in 2010 was 1.8 and must increase by 22% to 
2.08 under CPOS and 2.09 under LCCP. Meanwhile, cropping intensity for rice 
outside Java in 2010 was 1.45 and must increase by 31% in 2050 to 1.72 under 
CPOS and 1.78 under LCCP. 
Increasing rice cropping intensity in 2050 will be achieved by targeting a growth 
up to 20% in 2010-2030 and 22% in 2030-2050 for the CPOS. The target of 
increasing cropping intensity in LCCP is higher after 2030, namely 30-31% in 
2030-2050. 
The target of increasing cropping intensity from the two scenarios for other 
agricultural commodities by 2050 is only aimed at corn (5% in LCCP scenario), 
vegetables (5% in LCCP scenario), and palm oil (3-20% for both CPOS and LCCP 
scenarios). Under CPOS, cropping intensity in 2050 is 0.95 for corn, 0.95 for 
vegetables, and 0.81 for palm oil. Under LCCP, the cropping intensity target 
in 2050 is 0.98 for corn, 0.98 for vegetables, and 0.81 for palm oil. Cropping 
intensity of perennial crop such as palm oil refers to percentage of plantation 
that already reach productive stage. 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  47
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)Enhancing crop productivity under LCCP will need transformation policies that 
facilitates and increases the adoption of improved technologies and practices, 
improved policy for financial access and labour productivity. The following 
sections described transformation policies:
a.1. Farming Technology/Machinery
Increasing urbanization in the future will lead to a scarcity of labour in the 
agricultural sector. Currently, 48% of the population lives in rural areas and 52% 
in urban areas. With an urbanization rate of 4.1% per year, it is projected that 
the population living in urban areas will reach 60% in 2025, increase to 68% in 
2035, and reach 70% in 2045. The existence of a scarcity of labour demands a 
labour efficient agricultural system through the use of agricultural technology 
and machinery. The intensification in agriculture by technology adoption is 
expected to increase productivity. Government has encouraged the use of 
technology and machinery in agricultural production and provided assistance 
to support the adoption of technology by farmers. However, the technology 
adoption rate is limited due to financial constraints. Increasing financial access 
for the adoption of better technology and machinery in both scenarios is very 
important to ensure that the target of increasing productivity is achieved.
Agricultural machinery support to farmers is the key to increase productivity to 
answer the challenges of increasing food demand in the future. There has been 
significant development of agricultural machinery support for farmers. Growth 
of pre-harvest machines distribution is 92% during 2011-2019 in the form of 
tractors, water pumps, transplants, cultivators, and sprayers aims to increase 
productivity. Meanwhile, post-harvest assistance in the form of harvester, dryer, 
threshers, and rice mills to reduce post-harvest loss distribution growth is lower. 
Adoption of technology by farmers should not merely rely on government 
support, but also should mobilise other sources of support including access 
to  bank  or  non-banking  financial  institutions-NBFI  (cooperatives,  financial 
technology companies). Improvement of farmers/farmer groups access to 
credit can increase adoption of technology based on farmers needs and land 
condition. 
48 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)Under CPOS, the government is expected to continue agricultural machinery 
support to farmers/farmer groups. In this case, the role of field extension 
workers and universities is very important to ensure the adoption of agricultural 
technology in the field. Under LCCP, technology adoption is assumed to be 
much higher due to an increase of farmers/farmers group access to credits 
from bank or NBFIs to purchase agricultural machinery based on their needs. 
Empowerment of farmers group and innovative agriculture credit schemes 
(individual or group lending) is a key to higher adoption technology in the future. 
a.2. Financial Access
Intensification  (technology  adoption)  and  extensification  for  low-carbon 
agricultural development requires capital supports. Currently, credit distribution 
for agriculture, forestry, livestock and fisheries, forestry and plantations is only 
9% of total bank credit. The low distribution of agricultural credit by banks is 
related to collateral requirements and fluctuations in farmers income. Collateral 
requirements become an obstacle for small farmers who have limited assets to 
access credit from banks. Most farmers (52%) use their own capital or borrow 
from relatives/friends to finance their farming activities, and only 15% have 
access to banks. 
The  development  of  innovative  schemes  in  agriculture  value  finance  is 
needed to increase access to capital from all actors along the chain (farmers, 
input traders and collectors/traders) to increase productivity of commodities. 
Under CPOS, value chain finance such as Warehouse receipt system, Peer to 
Peer lending (P2P) and credit programme provide credits to buy agricultural 
inputs and tools for technology adoption to support low carbon agriculture. 
Optimizing the implementation of the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 
(SNKI) by actively involving the financial services industry (bank) and NBFIs and 
related institutions is important to increase financing for the agricultural sector. 
Under LCCP, innovation in value chain financing schemes is needed in order to 
synergize with policies related to food security in line with emission reduction 
target, for example the development of main food commodities and provision 
of forest areas for social forestry.
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  49
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)a.3. Labour Productivity
Improvement of quality and capacity of human resource in agriculture sector 
is needed to support sustainable agriculture. Increase of human resource 
capacity correlate with higher ability and skills to adopt new technology to 
increase agricultural productivity. It will also increase the ability of farmers to 
play active role in the low carbon development process.
Under CPOS, revitalization of institutional and agricultural extension institutions 
will make a positive contribution to improving agricultural human resources. 
Under LCCP, providing sufficient space for the private sector (traders, modern 
market) and research agencies/universities to actively engage in empowerment 
programme can be a solution to increase production and market. In addition, 
development of agricultural vocational school is important to improve next 
generation labour quality and capacity for sustainable agriculture. 
b. Integrated Farming System
The application of integrated farming in several agriculture and other land use 
sectors (food crop, fishery, livestock, plantation and forestry) will increase the 
efficiency and productivity rate and its economic value. Integrated farming 
that will be developed in the future is the integration of oil palm-livestock 
(cows, sheeps, and goats). This integration of raising livestock within oil palm 
plantation is in line with an effort to support palm oil production and strengthen 
food security (reducing meat imports) under low carbon framework (reduces 
deforestation and conducting waste management). The livestock will provide 
organic fertilizer, improve soil texture, reduce the production cost, and increase 
oil palm productivity. Under CPOS, integrated farming of oil palm-livestock is 
targeted to reach 11.70% (1.68 Mha) in 2030 and 22.72% (3.25 Mha) in 2050. 
Under LCCP, the target is increased to 21.11% (3.02 Mha) in 2030 and to 34.33% 
(  4.91 Mha) in 2050.
The integration of plantation and animal production has also been regulated 
under the Ministerial Regulation No. 105/2014 (Minister for Agriculture). There 
50 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)are more than 14.3 Mha of oil palm plantation potential for integrated farming. 
However, the current implementation is only 3% of the total potential. To 
increase the adoption of the integrated farming practices, particularly for large 
scale plantations, Government will examine possible incentive for encouraging 
climate-friendly farming practices. 
c. Optimizing Use of Unproductive Land
The use of current unproductive land in non-forest area will be optimised for 
expansion of cropland. In addition, the use of non-forested land in forest areas 
for agriculture production under the scheme of Social Forestry Programme 
will also be accelerated as well as the issuance of multi permit for concession 
to  allow  for  producing  non-timber  forest  products,  including  agriculture 
production through partnership with communities as part of approaches in 
addressing land tenure issues. Restriction of conversion of agriculture lands as 
mandated by the Law No. 41/2009 on sustainable agriculture land is enforced. 
Under CPOS, the conversion of rice paddy land in Java will reduce significantly 
from 1.34% per year to 0.60% per year, while in LCCP it will reduce to 0.10%. On 
the other hand, with expansion of rice paddy outside Java also decreases from 
1.31% to 1.00% per year in CPOS and to 0.80 in LCCP. This will occur if cropping 
intensity for rice in Java can be increased from 1.80 to 2.08 under CPOS and to 
2.09 under LCCP, while for rice outside Java, from 1.45 to 1.72 under CPOS and 
to 1.78 under LCCP which will be carried out through expanding irrigated land 
outside Java and the establishment of a new reservoir in Java. 
d. Reducing Food Loss and Food Waste
Reducing food loss and food waste is one of strategy to reduce greenhouse 
gas emission. Without reducing food loss and food waste, the land required 
to produce food is going to increase. At present, the level of food loss at the 
harvest and post-harvest stages reached 11.2 percent and 6.65-11.1% at the 
retail level. Modernization of harvesting tools is needed to improve harvesting 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  51
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)techniques and reduce yield losses. Furthermore, assistance with cold storage 
facilities and packaging technology are essential to reduce food loss during 
food distribution. Improvements in harvest and post-harvest technology are 
expected to reduce food loss from 71 Kg per capita in 2010 to 40 Kg per capita 
in 2050 under CPOS and to 34 Kg per capita under LCCP.
On the contrary, GDP growth in the future is assumed to have positive correlation 
with food waste due to higher food consumption. Food waste will increase from 
21 Kg per capita in 2010 to 97 Kg per capita in 2050 under CPOS and from 20 
Kg per capita in 2010 to 76 Kg per capita in 2050 under LCCP. The fraction of 
avoidable food waste could be reduced through campaign (private household) 
and applying green certification for large scale consumers (e.g. restaurants and 
hotels).
4.2.2. Energy Sector
Energy sector is the second main contributor of emission after AFOLU. The 
GHG-emitting activities are power generation, transportation (passenger and 
freight), energy use in industry and building (residential and commercial). 
The amount of GHG emissions depend on the magnitude and type of energy 
sources, which in turn depends on GHG mitigation measures. The mitigation 
options in energy sector includes: (i) energy efficiency measures in all sub-
sectors; (ii) substitution of fossil fuel by renewable in power generation and 
transport; and (iii) electrification of end use in building and in transportation 
(must be accompanied by decarbonisation of electricity).
4.2.2.1. Past Development 
The primary energy from 2000 to 2019 increased at a moderate average rate 
of 2.6% per year (see Figure 8). Significant decrease of energy supply in 2008 
was due to global financial crisis. Figure 8 shows some notable development 
of biofuel (crude palm oil based or CPO-based) in the past 5 years, as a result 
of biofuel policy which include price subsidy using budget collected from the 
biofuel feedstock producer (i.e. the palm oil industry). There were some notable 
52 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)increase in geothermal and hydropower, however the share of fossil energy 
remain very dominant. The biomass energy shown in the Figure 8 is traditional 
biomass used in rural residential.
Figure 8.  Development of primary energy supply
The primary energy is used to produce final energy such as electricity and 
oil fuels (refinery products). These final energy is used by energy end users 
such as transportation, residential, commercial and industry. Some oil fuels 
is also further converted into electricity. Some final energy end users such 
as industry sector also use primary energy (coal and natural gas) as their final 
energy demand. Therefore, coal and natural gas are considered as primary 
energy when they are used to produce electricity but they are accounted as 
final energy when they are used by end users. 
The  final  energy  is  consumed  by  various  energy  end-users  (residential, 
commercial, industry and transportation). From 2000 to 2019 final energy 
consumption grew at an average rate of 3.1%. As depicted in Figure 9 that the 
majority of final energy is used in productive sectors i.e. industry and transport 
sector. 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  53
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)Figure 9. Development of final energy consumption by consuming sectors
The accounting of final energy consumption is also made based on type of 
fuels. Figure 10 on the development of energy consumption by fuel shows the 
major final energy used in Indonesia are oil fuels, coal, natural gas, LPG, and 
electricity. Coal and natural gas are used by industry sector, oil fuels is primarily 
used for transportation. Small fraction of natural gas is used in residential and 
commercial. Electricity is used in industry, commercial and residential. Some 
fraction of oil fuels is also used in industry. 
Figure 10.  Development of final energy consumption by type of fuels
54 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)The largest share in the power generation mix is coal power plants, followed by 
gas power plants, renewable-based power plants and oil fuels power plants. 
Figure 11 shows the power generation mix in 2019, which indicates that in order 
to reduce GHG emissions in power, mitigation actions need to be focused on 
coal power plants because of coal is the largest contributor in the generation 
mix and coal has the largest emission factor among fossil fuels. 
Figure 11. Electricity generation mix 2019
Figure  12  shows  GHG  emission  estimation  for  year  2000-2019  which  is 
estimated based on the energy supply and consumption. During 2000-2019, 
the average growth rate GHG emission was 3.9% per year. Sub-sector wise, 
energy industry (primarily electricity generation) is the largest emitter followed 
by transportation and industry.

INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  55
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)4.2.2.2. Projection of Energy Sector Development
a. Basis for Projection 
Energy sector development projection used the following assumptions: 
•  Annual GDP growth in 2010-2020 was 5% and decreased to 1% in 2020 
due to COVID-19 pandemic, then gradually increase to 6% in 2025, with the 
growth of 2025 to 2040 is 5% growth and 2040-2050 is 4.5%. This annual 
economic growth is lower than those assumed in the National Energy Policy 
(Kebijakan Energi Nasional-KEN) projection which is 7%-8%. Therefore, the 
primary energy projection of LTS-LCCR in 2050 is around 600 Mtoe, lower 
than that of the KEN which is 1,000 Mtoe in 2050.
•  Energy demand will grow in accordance with the development drivers 
(economic and population). As the result of efficiency measures, the energy 
intensity of all energy consuming sectors in 2050 will be much less than 
that of in the base year.
•  In major industry fuels (gas, electricity, oil fuels, coal with CCS/CCUS), the 
arrangement of CO  cap will have been implemented, CCS/CCUS business 
2
using pipeline transport and trucking are already in place, and CO  from 
2
major industry will be handled by CCS/CCUS.
•  Energy input to industries will be transformed from primarily coal and oil 
fuels to natural gas, renewable (especially in smelters), and electricity, in 
decreasing order. 
•  By utilizing CCS/CCUS in industrial fossil energy systems, electrification 
of  industry  equipment  and  use  of  renewables  especially  hydropower 
in smelters, GHG emission intensity for industry is expected to be low. 
However, the level of GHG emission intensity will depend on the carbon 
content of the electricity supplied by the utility and the access of smelters 
to the hydropower resources. 
•  Implementation of efficiency measures, decarbonization of power using 
large renewable and coal with CCS/CCUS, and biofuel use in transport 
will enable energy sector to achieve significant emission reduction. The 
emissions in energy sector will decline  from 1,030 Mton CO e in 2030 to 
2
around 572 Mton CO e in 2050.

56 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)a.1. Power 
Demand for electricity comes from residential, commercial and industry, with 
a small fraction of the demand comes from transport (train). In the future 
significant fraction of electricity will be used by transport which is expected 
to shift to electric vehicles. Indonesia’s electricity consumption has grown at 
an average rate of 5.9%, from 135 TWh in 2009 to 240 TWh in 2019 (source: 
HEESI-2020).
In 2020, Indonesia household electrification reached 98% (MEMR 2020), which 
was connected to on-grid (large power plants) and off grid electricity (smaller 
plants, mostly renewables). It is targeted that in the future all household will 
have electricity access through grid and non-grid as well as roof-top solar PV. 
Based on past experience, demand growth of electricity will be around 5% per 
year. The need for new capacity, replacement and transmission expansion will 
be in line with the demand growth. At present, majority of power generation is 
fuelled by coal, while other power plants use gas, hydropower and geothermal. 
It is expected that in 2050 the power sector will nearly decarbonised, through: 
(i) utilization of renewables (hydro, geothermal, solar, wind, biomass) in massive 
scale;  (ii)  most  coal  powerplants  are  equipped  with  CCS/CCUS;  and  (iii) 
biomass-coal cofiring power plants are connected to CCS (Biomass Energy 
with Carbon Capture and Storage or BECCS).  Since Indonesia is an archipelago, 
the power system will be developed in the form of distributed power, instead of 
large centralised system. Power system with various types of power plants and 
different degree of intermittency will have to cope with grid stability. Therefore, 
the power sector will require reliable technology and dispatch management 
that ensure electricity grid stability.  Given that BECCS is expected to play a 
significant  role  in  GHG  mitigation  of  power  sector,  large  amount  of  solid 
biomass supply for the BECCS need to be prepared and developed, therefore, 
an integrated land use planning is crucial to ensure sustainable feedstock 
supply of biofuel and wood biomass for BECCS.
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  57
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)It is envisaged that the power situation in 2050 under LCCP will be as follows:
•  Power generation mix are: renewables (43%), coal (38%), natural gas (10%) 
and BECCS (8%). 
•  The renewables include hydro, geothermal, solar PV, biomass, biofuel and 
wind. 
•  Around 76% of the coal power plant are equipped with CCS to achieve zero 
emissions in coal power plants.
•  Installed capacity of renewable power generation mix are: solar PV 113 
GW, hydro 68 GW, geothermal 23 GW, wind power 17 GW, biomass 13 GW, 
biofuel 14 GW and BECCS 23 GW with negative emissions. 
•  The supply availability of some renewable power plants are intermittent, and 
therefore, in order to have a reliable supply system it will require integration 
with continuous stable power supply system (baseload) such as coal power 
plants.
•  The carbon intensity of power generation: 104 gram CO /kWh. 
2
•  Increasing development of ‘off-grid’ and ‘micro-grid’. 
•  Due to significant portion of intermittent renewable (solar and wind) will be 
deployed in the future, it will require development of smart grid that can 
handle large supply intermittency. 
•  Power plant with 100% renewable energy in remote areas will need Smart 
Micro Grid. 
a.2. Transport
In 2010 the metropolitan population accounts for 18% of the total population 
and is projected to reach around 25% in 2050 with increased population density 
in city centres and urban peripheries5. 
The type of land use in old town areas of metropolitan cities can be categorised as 
mixed land use where residential development, shops, employment community 
and recreation facilities, parks and open space are located close to each other. 
However, recent development of areas in metropolitan can be categorised as 
specialised land use, where industrial area is located outside the cities and new 
housing is built at the periphery of cities.  In non-metropolitan cities, the land 
5   extended from Proyeksi Penduduk Indonesia 2015-2045 (SUPAS 2015)
58 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)use type can be categorised as mixed land use.  Previous spatial distribution 
of population did not consider transport network since the transport network 
has not existed. Recently, site selection for new housing complex especially in 
metropolitan cities begin to consider the development of transport network 
such as BRT, LRT, dedicated lane for buses and inter-modality. Current transport 
infrastructure development focuses in motorized transport systems. 
Sociocultural practices, lifestyles and social status affect transport. Transport 
infrastructure  development  has  focused  on  motorized  transport  systems. 
In the future, the majority of the population will need to use public transport 
due overloaded traffic by excessive using of private vehicles. Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT) development will encourage tele-activity 
and eventually lessen personal transport load in metropolitan as well as in non-
metropolitan cities. Carpooling which has been partially practiced recently in 
metropolitan cities will continue to be implemented, driven by needs such as 
to avoid traffic jam.
The transport sector in the future is envisaged to drastically change, with the 
passenger transport mode are mostly mass public transport (buses, MRT, 
LRT) in metropolitan, buses in smaller cities, trains and big buses for inter-city 
transport, and air transport for between metropolitan and inter island (ships 
and ferries). Meanwhile, freight transport are train for inter-city, trucks/trailers, 
air and ships for inter-island cargoes, as well as small trucks in cities. 
The main energy source for transport are biofuels, oil fuels and electricity. 
Mitigation target in transport will be achieved by: (i) electrification of transport; 
(ii) supplying more biofuels for diesel substitute (fatty acid methyl-esther and 
bio-hydrocarbon or green diesel); and (iii) gasoline substitute (bioethanol and 
CPO-based gasoline). Since the past 10 years the government has introduce 
biofuels made from CPO, which is blended with petroleum diesel and called 
B20 (20% biodiesel plus 80% petroleum diesel).
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  59
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)It is envisaged that Indonesian transport situation in 2050 under LCCP will be 
as follows:
•  Transport distance of non-constrained transport (leisure, social or family 
visits) in metropolitan is around 10 km. 
•  Travel distance of constrained transport (home-to-work/school) is around 
40 km (in Jakarta). 
•  Some fraction of the workforces are working from home (tele working) by 
opening businesses at their homes such as small shops, maintenance and 
repair services and restaurants.
•  The breakdown of transport energy in 2050 are: biofuels (46%), oil fuels 
(20%),  electricity  (30%)  and  natural  gas  (4%).  The  biofuel  (CPO-based) 
programme is considered successful and will be continued to 2050 by 
supplying biofuel with higher biodiesel proportions (B30, B40, B50), which 
will be produced from sustainable sources.
•  “Mobility as a service” will continue to grow. 
•  Household expenditure for transport is around 20% of total household 
spending. 
•  Choice of mode of transport is affected by cost, comfort level and social 
status. 
•  Many cities are connected by inter-city trains especially in Java. Existing 
plan shows that 3,200 km of train tracks will be built to serve transport in 
Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi. 
b. Projection of Primary Energy Supply
The types of primary energy used in Indonesia are: coal, oil fuels, natural gas 
and renewables (hydropower, geothermal, solar, wind and bioenergy). Coal 
and natural gas are also used as final energy in industry, natural gas are also 
used as final energy in residential and commercial. It is estimated that from 
2010 to 2050, primary energy supply will grow, on average, around 3% per year. 
The projections of primary energy by types of energy for the 3 scenarios are 
presented in Figure 13. The Figure shows that CPOS  gives the largest energy 
supply (due to largest energy demand), which indicates that current policy will 
not lead to efficient energy systems. The TRNS and LCCP have lower energy 
60 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)supply due to lower energy demand resulted by energy efficiency measures in 
end users. The scenario that will result in the lowest primary energy supply is 
the LCCP. Figure 13 shows all energy types will continue to increase until 2050 
except for oil. The share of oil will become the lowest in 2050. Under LCCP, 
notable change is projected to occur in 2050 where the share of renewable will 
become the highest in the energy supply. The Figure also indicates that even 
until 2050 the role of coal in energy supply will remain significant, especially 
in power sub-sector which will be equipped with carbon capture and storage 
(CCS) systems. 
Figure 13. Projection of primary energy supply under CPOS, TRNS and LCCP 
c. Projection of Final Energy Demand
The projection of by-type final energy demand for the 3 scenarios is presented 
in Figure 14, which indicates that there will be a significant change toward 2050 
i.e., electricity is projected to be the most dominant type of energy. 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  61

(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)Figure 14. Projection of final energy demand by fuel type under CPOS, TRNS and LCCP
Figure 15, which show the projection of final energy demand by the consuming 
sectors, indicates that the distribution of the sectoral energy consumption in 
2050 will remain the same with that in 2010 and the share of commercial and 
residential consumption significantly increase in 2050 due to increasing role of 
commercial sector in the economy and increase of people welfare.

LCCP 
62 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)d. Projection of Electric Power Generation and Grid Emission Factor
The projection of power generation mix and the associated emission factor 
of electricity are shown in Figure 16, which shows that electricity generation 
will  increase  significantly  as  the  result  of  economic  development,  people 
welfare and population growth. From 2010 to 2050, electricity generation will 
increase in average 5.5% per year, which is about the same with the average 
economic growth. This may be the results of electrification of end user where 
people prefer electricity than combustion energy systems, also because of the 
development of commercial sector where its energy consumption is mostly in 
the form of electricity. 
Figure 16 shows a significant difference in power generation mix of the three 
scenarios, that CPOS will rely primarily on coal while the TRNS and LCCP are 
more diversified, with LCCP has more coal power plant equipped with CCS/
CCUS and renewables, including BECCS in 2050. Under LCCP, where the share 
of CCS is significant, the resulted emission factor will be significantly lower than 
other scenarios. In 2050, emission factor of CPOS, TRNS and LCCP are 502, 
295 and 14 gram CO  per KWh respectively.

INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  63
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)4.2.2.3. GHG Emission Projections and Mitigation Strategy
The projections of CO  emissions from energy activities is presented in Figure 
2
17, which shows that under CPOS, the major contributor of GHG emission is 
electricity (power generation). CPOS will result in continuous increase of GHG 
emission and reach around 2,115 Mton CO e in 2050. TRNS, where significant 
2
and high impact mitigation action start to be implemented, will result in lower 
GHG emission level but continue to increase with emission level reach around 
1,431 Mton CO e in 2050. Under LCCP, where high impact mitigation action such  
2
as CCS/CCUS have been largely implemented,  GHG emissions is projected 
to  decline from 1,030 Mton CO e in 2030 to around 572 Mton CO e in 2050. 
2 2
Figure 17 also shows that the electricity is the determinant of the total energy 
sector GHG emission level. 
Under TRNS and LCCP, deep cut of total GHG emission in energy sector will 
occur when there is a deep cut in power emissions, which is resulted from the 
use of CCS/CCUS, BECCS and renewables. 
Figure 17. Projection of energy sector emissions by emitting sector under CPOS, TRNS and 
LCCP 
64 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)Figure 18 shows a clearer picture of the difference of the emission projection of 
the three scenarios, that up to 2030 the three scenarios give the same level of 
emission (CPOS). In the beginning of 2030, the trajectories deviate from CPOS 
trajectory as more ambitious mitigation actions begin to be implemented. After 
2030 GHG emissions under TRNS still continue to increase with lower slope, 
while under LCCP the emissions continue to decrease. 
Figure 18. Projection of energy sector total emissions under CPOS, TRNS and LCCP 
Based on the understanding of type of fuels and energy-consuming sectors, 
taking into account past development and future projection of energy demand 
and supply, the LTS-LCCR was developed using the following general guidelines:
1.  Focussing on power sector.
2.  Minimize energy demand without sacrificing people welfare and economic 
development (energy efficiency measure), 
3.  Develop more efficient transport system (promote mass public transport), 
electrification of vehicles and other equipment at end-users (residential and 
commercial) with decarbonized electricity. 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  65
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)4.  Develop biofuels for transport and power plants, including biofuel resource 
base (feedstock, plantation).
5.  Shifting fuel from coal to gas and renewable in industry.
6.  Develop renewable energy (hydro, geothermal, solar PV and wind, including 
capacity development to produce solar PV and batteries) in power, transport 
and industry, which will consequently reduce coal for power. 
7.  BECCS (negative emission) will be used and the remaining coal power 
plants will be equipped with CCS/CCUS.
4.2.2.4. Issues to be Addressed
The planned mitigation actions under LTS-LCCR involve promotion of certain 
type of approach or technology that will lead to emission reduction but in 
some cases at the expense of other existing technology or approach, which 
are considered as unintended consequences. In order to minimize unintended 
consequences, the following issues were identified to be addressed during the 
planning and implementation period of the LTS-LCCR: (a) stranded/unmined 
coal resources/assets associated with large reduction of coal use in power 
generation, (b) stranded assets in the form of unused or early retirement of 
fossil-based power plants due to “locked-in” situation, and (c) migration of 
mining/fossil energy manpower to “green job”. 
a. Stranded Assets
Decarbonisation of energy sector requires substitution of the use of fossil energy 
by renewable energy and implementation of energy efficiency measures. Other 
approach to achieve decarbonization in energy sector is by continuing the use 
of fossil energy equipped by CCS/CCUS or other storage methods. Substitution 
of fossil energy by renewable energy will cause fossil energy resources are left 
unexploited and remain left underground and become stranded assets with 
some economic implications to the country.
Indonesia with total reserve and resource of about 29 billion ton and 115 billion 
ton respectively is a major player of coal and is one of the largest coal exporter 
66 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)in the world. In 2019 Indonesia’s  coal production reached 610 Mton where 
around 375 Mton were exported. In the past years, the coal production grew at a 
very high rate of 8% per year from 275 Mton in 2010 to 610 Mton in 2019.  Based 
on the current development trend, coal production is estimated to remain high 
with slow decline.  Under CPOS coal production will reach 525 Mton in 2050, 
where 80% of the production will be used to meet domestic demand. Under 
LCCP and global climate change regime (lower global coal demand), coal 
demand will decrease and consequently the production will also slow down 
accordingly. In 2050 coal production is estimated to reach 322 Mton where 
the majority of it (290 Mton) will be used to fulfil domestic demand. Under this 
scenario, the coal industry will have production loss of 203 Mton in 2050. The 
loss would be much bigger if Indonesia’s mitigation strategy were in the form 
of extreme coal elimination (phase out). Figure 19 illustrates Indonesia’s coal 
production and production loss at two different scenarios (CPOS and LCCP). 
Figure 19. Coal production, domestic consumption and production loss (annual and 
cumulative)
Figure 19 shows that cumulative loss of coal production between 2030-2050 
will be around 2.4 billion ton. By using future coal price of USD 90/ton, the 
cumulative value of opportunity loss of coal production will be around USD 218 
billions. Furthermore, there will also be economic loss associated with loss of 
production opportunity, such as coal mine investment that is already in place 
will become a wasted capital. 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  67
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)b. Locked-in of Fossil Power Plants
Consideration  of  locked-in  phenomenon  of  fossil  fuel-based  power  plant 
such as coal power plant will be essential in the planning of power plant for 
the period of 2020 to 2050. This is due to the fact that once the coal power 
plant is installed, it will be difficult to replace the plant with renewable ones 
as replacement of power plant that is already installed and operational will be 
costly and impractical. 
c. Preparation of Migration to Green Jobs
The switch from fossil-based energy system to low carbon energy system 
will  be  accompanied  by  generation  of  economic  opportunity  associated 
with  renewable  energy  development,  including  employment  opportunity. 
Preparation  of  employment  transition  from  fossil-based  energy  system  to 
low-carbon energy system will be part of overall energy transition efforts. The 
transition will require preparation of human resources which will be aligned with 
policies and programmes on human resource development, including policies 
and programmes towards Indonesia Vision 2045.  
4.2.3. Waste Sector
Four following pillars of guidance are used to develop a long-term low-carbon 
strategy toward zero emissions in the waste sector, taking into account past 
development and projection of future waste management activities through 
reduction, avoidance, destruction, and utilization of GHG emissions, particularly 
methane (CH ) gas, which generated during the treatment of municipal solid 
4
waste (MSW), domestic wastewater, and industrial solid waste and wastewater. 
In the MSW treatments, the reduction is implemented through the utilization 
of aerobic treatment for the management of solid waste disposal sites (SWDS), 
the avoidance is implemented by reducing the waste to be treated to avoid 
the generation of methane gas emissions, i.e. recycling (3R), waste banks, ITF 
(Intermediate Treatment Facilities), and composting (compost house), MSW 
bio-digester, and the destruction/utilization is implemented by burning the 
landfill gas (LFG) for flaring, power generation, or gas cooking in household, 
68 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)producing the RDF (refuse derived fuel), and burning the waste in PLTSa6 (MSW 
power plant). 
In the domestic wastewater treatments, the reduction is implemented through 
the use of aerobic treatment for septic tank, the avoidance is implemented 
through recovering of septic tank sludge for sludge treatment and treating 
domestic wastewater using centralised aerobic system, and the utilization is 
implemented through recovering methane gas from communal bio-digester. 
In the industrial waste treatments, the reduction is implemented by introducing 
aerobic processes for the treatment of wastewater, solid waste, and sludge 
of  wastewater  treatment,  the  avoidance  is  implemented  by  utilizing  solid 
waste (including sludge from wastewater treatment) for fuels or materials and 
composts, and the destruction is implemented by introducing biodigester 
process equipped with a methane recovery system (biogas) for flaring (to 
destroy the methane gas), electricity generation or fuels.
4.2.3.1. Waste Sector Development and Projection
The projection of GHG emissions level is estimated using assumptions that the 
rate of increase in the amount of waste generation and waste to be treated 
in each of treatment unit is affected by several parameters, i.e. population 
growth, economic growth, regulations, policies, lifestyle, treatment plans, and 
source reduction rate of the waste. Those parameters will result in increase or 
decrease of GHG emissions level. The population and economic growth used 
for estimating waste generation refers to the data from Statistics Indonesia in 
Sub-chapter 2.1. 
a. Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Management
Law No. 18/2008 regarding MSW management obliges local governments to 
manage MSW. In addition, there are National Policy and Strategy (Jakstranas) 
and Provincial Policy and Strategy (Jakstrada) in waste management as well as 
Presidential Regulation No. 35/2018 concerning MSW utilization for electricity 
6   PLTSa is abbreviation of municipal solid waste-based power generation (Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Sampah)
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  69
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)generation in PLTSa or RDF (refuse-derived fuels) that support GHG emission 
reduction. 
Currently, most of MSW is transported to SWDS after it is reduced at sources, 
composted, recycled, and recovered. Under CPOS, the MSW will be managed 
through waste reduction at sources (30%) by 3R (reduce-reuse-recycle) and 
waste treatment (70%) through landfilling, composting, and converting waste 
to energy. This 3R is a part of Circular Economy which is promoted in Indonesia.
If it is assumed that MSW can be reduced at sources, the MSW generation 
is estimated to be 25 ton/capita/year with the growth rate of about 0.6% per 
year during 2020-2050, and the MSW is estimated to increase to reach 83.8 
Mton in 2050. Under CPOS, 70% of the MSW will be managed in landfill and/or 
converted to energy as PLTSa and/or RDF. The remaining 30% of MSW will be 
reduced at sources through 3R and composting. However, only those related 
to paper recycled and/or reused that are considered as mitigation measures. 
Removing the paper from the waste to be treated in SWDS can reduce the 
GHG emissions because the paper has high DOC and DMC (parameters that 
determine the amount of GHG emissions generation in SWDS). 
Under CPOS, the mitigation include 30% waste reduction and 70% of the waste 
is treated in SWDS (some of them equipped with LFG recovery) and utilized for 
energy (PLTSa and RDF), which in turn reduce open burning significantly. The 
mitigation also covers additional septic tank (equipped with biogas and sludge 
recovery), implementation of aerobic system, and the use of industrial liquid / 
solid waste for energy production. 
TRNS increases the potential of CPOS mitigation by adding the number of 
SWDS equipped with LFG recovery, the amount of MSW used for PLTSa and 
RDF/SRF (solid recover fuels), the number of biodigester equipped with biogas 
and sludge recovery, and the number of paper recycling and composting. 
The mitigation also covers the increase of septic tanks utilisation (50% new 
houses) equipped with biogas recovery or aerobic, sludge recovery systems 
and increased utilization of waste for energy. 
70 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)LCCP increases the potential of TRNS and CPOS mitigation significant adding 
the number of SWDS equipped with LFG recovery, the amount of MSW used 
for PLTSa and RDF/SRF, the number of biodigester equipped with biogas 
and sludge recovery, and the number of paper recycling and composting. 
The mitigation also covers the increase of septic tanks utilisation (100% new 
houses) equipped with biogas recovery or aerobic, sludge recovery systems 
and increased utilization of waste for energy. Increased use of septic tanks 
(100% new houses) equipped with biogas recovery, aerobic systems, sludge 
recovery and maximizing the utilization of liquid waste and industrial solid waste 
for energy. 
Figure 20 shows the stream of MSW management and the associated GHG 
emissions.  Introducing  composting,  paper  recycling,  and  PLTSa  (including 
RDF) will reduce the amount of MSW to be treated in SWDS and open burning 
practices, which in turn will decrease the GHG emissions in the LCCP significantly 
with the level lower than GHG emissions level in 2010.

LCCP
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  71
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)b. Domestic Wastewater Treatment (WWT)
Refer to Statistic Indonesia, 89% of people live in urban area and 71% of people 
live in rural area can access toilet (individual or communal), which the use of 
centralised treatment and biodigester are limited. The government long-term 
plan has target that all people have access to toilet whether it is individual or 
communal toilets. Most of those toilets have septic tank/latrine to treat the 
black water, while small fraction of those toilets has channel to a wastewater 
sewerage to treat the grey water in a centralised WWT plant. The remaining 
population cannot access the toilet as well as the septic tank (households or 
population with no septic tank). 
The  associated  emissions  from  domestic  wastewater  are  influenced  by 
wastewater  characteristics  and  types  of  the  WWT  technology.  The  total 
degradable organic compound in wastewater (TOW) is the main characteristics 
that significantly affect the GHG emissions generation of the treatment plants 
while the type of treatment technology will determine GHG emissions factor of 
each WWT plant. The values of total TOW of domestic WWT and its projection 
under the three scenarios are presented in Figure 21. Figure 21 shows that 
currently more people have access to toilet equipped with septic tank in line 
with the government programme for the improvement of sanitation and health. 
However, beyond 2030, it is estimated that the use of septic tank will be reduced 
by increasing wastewater treated in the centralised (aerobic) system.
Figure 21. Total TOW of domestic WWT in Indonesia and its projection
72 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)c. Industrial Waste Treatment (Industrial WWT and Solid Waste Treatment)
Industrial wastewater treatment is the main source of GHG emissions from the 
waste sector and it will remain as the main source with 71% in 2030 until 2050 
if the mitigation actions are only the extend of current policy. The emissions 
are generated from wastewater treatment units of several types of industries, 
i.e. food and beverage, agro-industries, alcohol refining, petroleum refineries, 
oleochemical, plastic resins, CPO-based biofuels and other products as listed 
in IPCC 2006 and refined 2019 Guidelines. Similar with the domestic WWT, the 
associated GHG emissions generation rate of these industrial WWT units are 
also influenced by waste characteristics and types of WWT plant technology. 
The trend of production capacity of each industry and its projection is estimated 
using data and assumptions from industries, association, statistics of medium 
and large industries, etc. 
The  load  capacity  of  industrial  WWT  and  solid  waste  is  estimated  with 
assumptions that the industry is estimated continue to grow in line with the 
increasing of production capacities of agroindustry, food and beverage, and 
pulp paper industries. These industries are determined as priority industries, 
which has priority to continuously developed and expected to grow such as 
planned in ‘RIPIN’ (Rencana Induk Pembangunan Industri Nasional, National 
Development Plan of National Manufacturing Industry) during 2015 to 2035. 
Under RIPIN, the growth rate of manufacturing industry (exclude oil and gas) 
is estimated to achieve 10.5%. There is no information concerning the growth 
rate of specific industry, except RIPIN states that there are 8 types of energy 
intensive to be included for GHG mitigation plans. Therefore, the projection of 
production capacity of these industries will be included in the estimation and 
projection of national GHG emissions for the three scenarios. 
Figure 22 shows majority of production capacity are food and beverage, agro-
industries and petroleum industries, in which CPO is the biggest production 
industries followed by petroleum refineries, vegetable-fruit-Juice, CPO cooking 
oil and margarine, vegetable oils, and pulp and paper. The trend of CPO 
production capacity is estimated to increase in line with increasing demand of 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  73
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)CPO for export and domestic consumptions (biofuels, oleo chemicals, foods). 
The projection of CPO production has considered moratorium of new permit 
for oil palm plantations, which in turn will limit the production capacity of palm 
oil and CPO. Each of these industries has their own COD content, and therefore 
the TOW is estimated by each type of industries.
Figure 22. Production capacity of each type of industry and its projections
Figure  23  presents  the  trend  of  TOW  of  each  type  of  industries  and  its 
projections, where CPO production, pulp and paper, and vegetable, fruit and 
juice industries have bigger TOW compare to other industries due to their 
wastewater characteristics.

(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)Figure 23. TOW of each type of industry and its projections
4.2.3.2. GHG Emission Projection and Mitigation Strategy
Figure 24 shows that GHG emissions level of the waste sector will increase 
significantly under CPOS at the rate of 1.6% per year to achieve 272 Mton CO2e 
in 2050 from 198 Mton CO2e in 2030 or with the rate of 2.83% per year during 
2010 - 2050. If it is compared to the GHG emissions level in 2010, the emissions 
increase 3 times in 2050. The GHG emissions of the waste sector is primarily 
generated from industrial waste treatment. 
Under TRNS, the GHG emissions level is estimated to increase at the rate 0.6% 
per year to achieve 223 Mton CO e in 2050 from 198 Mton CO e in 2030 or with

the rate of 2.33% per year during 2010-2050. If it is compared to GHG emission 
level in 2010, the GHG emissions increases 2.5 times in 2050. 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  75
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)Under LCCP, the GHG emissions will decrease 2.5% per year from 198 Mton 
CO e in 2030 to 120 Mton CO e in 2050 with the rate of 2.5% per year. If it is 
2 2
compared to the GHG emissions level in 2010, under LCCP the GHG emissions 
level will be 1.35 times with those in 20107. Under LCCP, all potential mitigation 
under CPOS and TRNS are maximized by adding several ambitious mitigations, 
particularly in the MSW and industrial waste treatments. 
The GHG emissions intensities under three scenarios are presented in Figure 
25. The Figure shows that under LCCP, the GHG emissions intensity is 391 Kg 
CO e per capita in 2010 and is projected to reach the level of 359 Kg CO e per 
2 2
capita in 2050. The GHG emission intensity in 2050 is reduced about 0.9 times 
the GHG emissions intensity in 2010 or 0.59 times if it is compared to the GHG 
emissions intensity in 2030.

The level of GHG emissions from MSW treatments in 2050 is expected to be 
reduced significantly to achieve 32.2 Mton CO e under LCCP, while under CPOS 
2
and TRNS the GHG emission level is accounted to 65.3 Mton CO e and 52.1 Mton 
2
CO e respectively. The GHG emissions projection under LCCP is estimated to 
2
be lower than those in CPOS and TRNS by implementing mitigation actions 
through a large share of MSW utilization for energy generation (PLTSa/RDF), 
which is effectively to reduce the GHG emissions. Figure 26 shows the GHG 
emissions level and its intensity, that the GHG emissions in 2050 is lower (0.93 
times) than those in 2010. Figure 26 also shows the GHG emissions intensities 
of the three scenarios, in which under LCCP the GHG emissions intensity is 
reduced 0.66 times from 146 Kg CO e per capita to become 96 Kg CO e per

capita.

b. Domestic Wastewater Treatment
Government programs to increase the number of septic-tank from 71% in 
2020 to 85% in 2050 for people live in rural and from 88% in 2020 to 99% in 
2050 for people live in urban are implemented in order to increase the access 
of people to the toilet (individual and communal) could be implemented as 
mitigation measures by introducing technologies that reduces or lower the 
GHG emissions. 
Under CPOS, mitigation under unconditional NDC are extended until 2050, 
which include additional septic tank with biogas recovery and sludge removal 
and implementation of aerobic system. The GHG emission projection under 
CPOS is estimated to achieve 34.1 Mton CO e.
2
Under TRNS and LCCP, more ambitious mitigation mitigation can be deployed 
to decrease the level of GHG emissions through the additional aerobic septic 
tank, biodigester septic tank equipped with methane recovery for new toilet/
septic-tank, and centralised WWT for domestic wastewater. Under TRNS, it is 
assumed that the use of aerobic centralised will increase from 1% of people 
live in urban in 2020 to 14% in 2050 while under LCCP it will increase to 36% 
in 2050. The GHG emissions projection of these mitigation actions (see Figure 
27) has considered the increasing number of people live in urban area toward 
2050, from 57% in 2020 to 70% in 2050.
78 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)Figure 27 shows that GHG emissions level of LCCP can be achieved by a large 
share of centralised treatment (IPAL) and reducing the non-septic tank. The 
Figure also shows that under LCCP, the GHG emissions level in 2050 (25.67 
Mton CO e) is still higher than the GHG emissions level in 2010 (18.07 Mton 
2
CO e).

Figure 27. The projection of GHG emissions level and intensity of Domestic WWT 
c. Industrial Waste Treatment 
Under  CPOS,  GHG  emissions  can  be  reduced  through  the  majority  of 
mitigation in several significant GHG emissions contributor industries, i.e. palm 
oil mills, pulp paper, vegetable-fruit-juice, organic chemicals, and vegetable 
oil industries. Under TRNS and LCCP, most of wastewater from significant 
emissions contributor industries will be treated for energy and material sources, 
such as the use of anaerobic digester equipped with methane gas recovery and 
utilizing the sludge from WWT unit for energy, compost and materials sources. 
The GHG emissions level of the three scenarios is presented in Figure 28. 
Under LCCP, all of the above mitigation actions are expected to increase 
significantly. Beyond 2030, mitigation under LCCP are expected to reduce 
GHG emissions to 62 Mton CO e in 2050. Compared to the GHG emissions 
2
level in 2010 (27 Mton CO e), the GHG emissions target under LCCP in 2050 is 
2
2.3 times to the level in 2010 due to the increasing production capacity of these 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  79
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)industries. In 2050, GHG emission level under CPOS and TRNS are estimated to 
reach 172 Mton CO e and 139 Mton CO e respectively. 
2 2
Figure 28 shows that GHG emissions under LCCP is lower than CPOS and TRNS 
due to large share of mitigation in waste treatment of CPO. The GHG emissions 
intensity of those three scenarios are 514 Kg CO e per capita (CPOS), 416 Kg 
2
CO e per capita (TRNS), and 186 Kg CO e per capita (LCCP).

4.2.4. Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU)
The GHG emissions sources from activities related to IPPU are from industrial 
processes, the use of carbonates and GHGs in products, and non-energy 
uses of fossil fuel carbon. The main GHG emission sources are from industrial 
processes that chemically or physically transform materials and release carbon 
dioxide (CO ) during processes, clinker processes in cement industry, blast 
2
furnace in iron and steel industry, ammonia and other chemical products that 
are manufactured from fossil fuels and used as chemical feedstock. 
80 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)GHG emissions that are resulted from industrial processes are of CO and 
2 
nitrous oxide (N O) from nitric acid production, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) as 
2
CF  and C F  from aluminium production, while hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) 
4 2 6
and sulphur hexafluoride (SF ) are released during the use of these gases in

4.2.4.1. Industrial Sector Development Projection
Indonesia considered eight priority industries are related to the GHG emission 
intensives, namely: cement, metal (iron and steel), pulp paper, ammonium 
fertilizer, petrochemicals, ceramics, textile and textile product, and food and 
beverage. Among those industries, cement, basic chemicals (ammonia fertilizer, 
nitric acid, other petrochemicals), iron and steel making, and metal smelters 
(nickel, gold, aluminium, and bauxite) are considered as IPPU and energy’s 
GHG emissions intensives. There are other industries that are not considered 
as energy or IPPU GHG emission intensives but they have significant GHG 
emissions from their waste treatments, i.e. food and beverage, pulp and paper, 
and textiles. Those industries are both domestic and export oriented, which 
product carbon footprint becomes an important issue. The GHG emissions 
mitigation from the waste treatment of these industries are discussed in the 
waste sector. 
The priority industries are expected to grow as planned in RIPIN during 2015 
to 2035, with the growth rate of national manufacturing industry (exclude oil 
and gas) is about 10.5%. RIPIN states that there are 8 types of energy intensive 
that have to be included for GHG emissions mitigation plans from industry 
sector without information on the growth rate of specific industry. Therefore, 
the projection of production capacity or product use and the associated GHG 
emissions use the trend and relevant issues (national or regional GDP and 
production target). 
The GDP growth of manufacturing industry is assumed that beyond 2025 
(after COVID-19 pandemic recovery) will increase to 6% in average per year 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  81
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)(slightly higher than national GDP growth projection). The development of 
manufacturing GDP is estimated based on the gross product structure, which 
will slightly change with the decreased of secondary industries contribution of 
secondary industries is estimated to decrease from 51% (2010) to 40% (2050). 
The contribution of primary and tertiary industries is estimated to increase from 
23% and 25% in 2010 to become 29% and 31% in 2050 respectively. 
The amount of the GHG emissions is influenced by the production capacity of 
industries that potential in releasing GHG emissions from IPPU related activities. 
The chemical industries, such as ammonium fertilizer, nitric acids, and other 
petrochemical industries are expected to continue to grow in line with the 
population and manufacturing growth. 
As an overview, cement industries grew relatively high at the rate of 6.5% per year 
from 43.09 Mton (2010) to 76.2 Mton (2019), while the production capacity has 
decreased significantly for about 18.9% to 71.8 Mton in 2020 and estimated to 
be 70.4 Mton in 2021 during COVID-19 pandemic. However, cement production 
is expected to continue to grow with average rate 0.6% per year during 2020-
2030 to reach 81.6 Mton in 2030 and 0.78% per year during 2030-2050 to 
reach 99.6 Mton in 2050 in line with economic and infrastructure development 
outside Java. Ammonia production has increased from 4.8 Mton in 2010 to 5 
Mton in 2020 at a rate of 0.4% per year. 
In line with the Indonesia’s target to maintain food sufficiency and security, 
ammonia production is expected to increase with the growth rate of 1% per 
year to achieve 10.3 Mton in 2050. Urea production is integrated with ammonia 
plant, which absorbs CO  from ammonia plant as feed stock to produce urea. 
2
The urea production has increased from 6.6 Mton (2010) to 9.0 Mton (2020) 
with growth rate of 3.2% per year. During COVID-19 pandemic, the production 
capacity remains high at 9 Mton (2020) and estimated to increase at the rate of 
2.4% per year during 2020-2050 to achieve 14.7 Mton in 2050. 
Nitric acid industry has significantly increased with the rate of 39.7% per year 
82 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)from 0.032 Mton (2010) to 0.33 Mton (2020). There is an additional new plant 
in 2022 with a capacity of 9 Mton nitric acid per year since the last nitric acid 
plants (BBRI) construction is 2012. The development plans of this industry will 
depend on the additional consumption of nitric acids for fertilizer (NPK) and 
is projected to grow with a rate at 2% per year (2030 to 2050). Currently, Iron 
and steel industry production capacity is around 15 Mton per year (nickel alloy, 
carbon steel, and stainless steel), which increased with 12.6% per year from 
2010 to 2016 and is estimated relatively stagnant until 2030 and will grow 5.59% 
per year from 5.76 Mton in 2030 to 17.1 Mton in 2050. Using these assumptions 
and trend of production growth in some significant industries, the projection of 
GHG emissions intensive industries is estimated. 
Figure 29a shows trend of production growth and its projection while the 
historical data of production capacity and its projection of each GHG emissions 
intensive industry are presented in Figure 29b. It shows that manufacturing 
production per capita tends to increase.

4.2.4.2. GHGs Emission Projections
Figure 30 shows the GHG emissions level for type of industries related to IPPU 
under three scenarios while the GHG emissions intensity is shown in Figure 31. 
Under CPOS, it is assumed that mitigation actions include (a) 50% of national 
cement productions implement blended cement with a clinker/cement ratio 
of 0.75 in 2050 and (b) 38% of national ammonia production using advanced 
technology with natural gas consumption at a rate of 40 GJ per ton NH  in 
3
2050. Under this scenario, the trend of GHG emissions will continue to increase 
by 1.7% per year during 2010-2050 to reach 70 Mton of CO e in 2050. The level 
2
of GHG emissions in 2050 is still high at 2 times the level of GHG emissions in 
2010.
Under TRNS, it is assumed that mitigation actions include (a) significant increase 
of cement production using blended cement technology with a clinker/cement 
ratio 0.75 in 2050, (b) the additional of ammonia production using advanced 
and efficient technology with natural gas consumption at a rate of 40 GJ per ton 
NH  in 2050, (c) the use of secondary catalyst for N O digestion/destruction in 
3 2
nitric acid production industry, (d) the use of improved (advanced) processing 
technology for Aluminium production8, and (e) the utilization of scrap up to 10%

84 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)as raw material in iron and steel industries. Under this scenario, the trend of 
GHG emissions will continue to increase by 1.6% per year during 2010-2050 to 
reach 66 Mton of CO e in 2050 which is 1.9 times the level of GHG emissions 
2
in 2010.
Under  LCCP,  it  is  assumed  that  mitigation  actions  include  (a)  significant 
increasing  of  cement  production  using  blended  cement  technology  with 
clinker/cement ratio of 0.70 in 2050, (b) increasing ammonia production using 
advanced and efficient technology with natural gas consumption at a rate of 
35 GJ per ton NH  in 2050, (c) increasing the use of secondary catalyst for N O 
3 2
digestion/destruction in nitric acid production industry ((higher than those in 
TRNS), (d) the use of improved (advanced processing technology for Aluminium 
production, and (e) the use of scrap up to 20% (higher than those in TRNS) as 
raw material in iron and steel industries but it is limited by the availability of the 
scrap materials. 
Under  this  scenario,  although  GHG  emissions  are  estimated  to  continue 
increasing at a rate of 0.9% per year (2010-2050) to reach 50.2 Mton CO e in 
2
2050 or 0.9 times the level of GHG emissions in 2010.

for those three scenarios. 
Figure 31. GHG emissions per ton product and capita and its projections
4.2.4.4. Mitigation Strategy
a. Blended Cement in Cement Industry
The GHG emissions from cement industry was affected by the clinker to 
cement ratio. At the clinker to cement ratio is 0.81 in 2010, the GHG emissions 
from cement production is 0.445 ton CO  per ton cementitious while for the 
2
clinker to cement ratio is 0.75, from cement production is 0.419 ton CO  per ton 
2
cementitious. 
Blended cement mitigation under CPOS are the extend of clinker to cement 
ratio in 50% of cement production capacities at the level of clinker to cement 
ratio of 0.75 to 2050. Under TRNS, blended cement mitigation under CPOS is 
increased by implementing clinker to cement ratio of 0.75 from 2030 to 2050 
for most cement productions. Under LCPP, blended cement mitigation are 
increased by implementing clinker to cement ratio up to 0.70 for most cement 
productions in 2030 to 2050.
86 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)b. Technology Improvement of New Ammonia Urea Plants 
The ammonia plant technology is improved from 45 GJ/ton NH  to 40 GJ/ton 
3
NH  of natural gas consumption. The improved technology can be efficient 
3
ammonia plant and/or efficient urea in absorbing CO . 
2
Under CPOS, it is assumed that 38% of most ammonia productions consume 
natural gas at the rate of 40 GJ/ton NH  in 2050. Under TRNS, mitigation under 
3
CPOS are increased by implementing more improved technology therefore 
most ammonia productions consume natural gas at the rate of 40 GJ/ton NH  
3
in 2050. Under LCCP, the natural gas consumption in the most plant should at 
least have natural gas consumption rate of 36.6 GJ natural gas /ton NH  orat 
3  
least Best Practice Technology (BPT) in 2050. 
It should be noted that current world BPT has natural gas consumption rate of 
32 GJ/ton NH  while the European best available technology (BAT) has 31.8 GJ/
3
ton NH , the world BAT has 28 GJ/ton NH  (IEA, 2015), and some of ammonia 
3 3
plants in Indonesia have 33-35 GJ/ton NH .

c. Secondary Catalyst for N O Destruction in Nitric Acid Industry
2
The profile of Indonesian nitric acid industries shows a significant increase in 
the production capacity with two additional new plants in 2012 and one plant 
in 2022 (see Figure 30). In line with this increasing production capacities, N O 
2
emissions from the nitric acid production is also increased (see Figure 30). 
These new plants use more efficient technology with GHG emissions factor 
(EF) of about 8 to 9 Kg N O per ton HNO compared to the first production 
2 3, 
plants (1990’s technology) with the EF was 10-19 Kg N O per ton HNO .
2 3
One of the two new technologies is also equipped with mitigation technology, 
i.e. non-selective catalyst reduction (NSCR) for N O emissions destruction. With 
2
this mitigation technology, the EF decreased to 2.5 Kg N O per ton HNO . Other 
2 3
selective catalytic process, e.g. secondary catalyst reduction (SCR) will also 
be applied as secondary mitigation for the N O emissions destruction in nitric 
2
acids productions in 2022, with the EF decreased to 2.5 Kg N O per ton HNO . 
2 3
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  87
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)The deployment potential for future mitigation is relatively small due to high 
cost, therefore, this mitigation will be deployed under the LCCP.
d. Improvement of Aluminium Processing Technology
Improving the aluminium production plant with an advanced technology that 
could reduce PFCs (CF /C F ) emissions has been implemented, i.e. reducing 
4 2 6
the Anode Effect (AE) at smelter facilities. AE is a condition where the stress 
in the reduction furnace suddenly increases when the dissolved alumina level 
in the smelting furnace is far below normal. Since its operation in 1982, the 
smelter used CWPB (centre work pre-bake cell technology, with bar brake). AE 
reduction is achieved by replacing software and hardware, and incorporating 
a new algorithm in the control system so that reduces AE frequency, duration, 
and over voltage. This mitigation is planned to be deployed in the aluminium 
industry for additional mitigation potential in 2050 under TRNS and LCCP. By 
maintaining this mitigation technology, in 2050, PFC emissions level under 
TRNS and LCCP can be reduced from 577 Kton CO e (CPOS) to 462 Kton CO e.
2 2
4.3. Economy Impact of Mitigation
The  Asia-Pacific  Integrated  Model/Computable  General  Equilibrium  (AIM/
CGE) was used to analyse economy impact of mitigation action in 2050. The 
model was designed under different sets of development scenarios to estimate 
greenhouse gas emission and its economy impact related to the changes in land 
use and energy under the scenarios. Data base for modelling is Input Output 
Table year 2010 that consist of 46 sectors. Economic growth assumption has 
been adjusted with pandemic COVID-19 impact that slowing down economy 
during 2020-2025. 
Three mitigation scenarios (CPOS, TRNS and LCCP) are assessed at given GHG 
emission levels, land use, and renewable power generation targets. Table 2 
shows mitigation actions in both AFOLU and energy sector, where less ambitious 
mitigation available in 2020 and ambitious mitigation available in 2025.

Figure 32 and Figure 33 shows that under all scenarios of CPOS, TRNS and 
LCCP,  positive  economic  growth  under  emission  reduction  target  can  be 
achieved. Under higher additional investment to support mitigation action, 
macroeconomic loss will be less under the stringent GHG reduction (LCCP). 
Indonesia GDP under CPOS will reach USD 3,316 billion in 2050 with average 
growth 5.04%. Meanwhile, average GDP growth under TRNS (5.02% ) and LCCP 
slightly lower (5%) and reach USD 3,282 billion and USD 3,262 billion in 2050. 
The economy impact of mitigation in both AFOLU and the energy sector will 
be higher by including co-benefit opportunities for reducing both greenhouse 
and other health-damaging pollution. 
Similarly, there are increase of welfare GDP under all scenarios. Indonesia will 
become high income country where GDP per capita increase from USD 2,983 
in 2010 to USD 10,039 under CPOS, USD 9,935 under TRNS, and USD 9,876 
under LCCP in 2050.

highest contribution to total GDP of Indonesia. Average growth of household 
consumption are 5.61% under CPOS, slightly higher of 5.62% under TRNS and

In all scenarios, transformation technology is important to increase production 
under emission reduction target. Investment in AFOLU sector  is important 
to  increase  productivity  such  as  for  mechanisation,  agricultural  inputs, 
land  management  and  research  and  development.  Meanwhile,  additional 
investment also needed in energy sector for technology adoption to increase 
energy efficiency and adopt CCS/CCUS technology. Growth of investment 
is essential during 2020-2050 in CPOS, TRNS, and LCCP by annual average 
4.38%, 4.14% and 4.13%, respectively. Total investment in 2050 are USD 821.5 
billion under CPOS, USD 749.5 billion under TRNS and USD 745.8 billion under 
LCCP (see Figure 36). Moreover, higher emission reduction target requires 
higher growth in additional investment of 5.8% per year for CPOS and 8.2% 
per year for TRNS and LCCP. In 2050, additional investment will reach USD 39.7 
billion under CPOS, USD 73.4 billion under TRNS and USD 73.3 billion under

(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)V.  ADAPTATION 
PATHWAYS
Pathways development for adaptation used 
a  stepwise  process  to  identify  goals  and 
analyse  potential  problems  and  actions,  in 
some futures using temporary scenarios. The 
results are actions to reduce vulnerability and 
realize opportunities, including a monitoring 
system to maintain the desired trajectory of 
the pathway.
The  LTS-LCCR  2050  emphasizes  the 
importance  of  synergy  between  climate 
change mitigation and adaptation (see Figure 
39). Climate resilience in accordance with the 
direction of the Paris Agreement is translated 
into  economic,  social  and  environmental 
resilience  with  the  principle  of  no-one  left 
behind.  To  implement  climate  resilience  it 
must emphasize the principle of justice and 
sustainability in which requires a process of 
transformation. The strategy towards climate 
resilience  is  carried  out  by  through  means 
of  investment,  human  resources  capacity  / 
green job opportunity, and land & seascape 
management.  As  a  result,  through  climate 
resilience  strategy  the  development  plan 
becomes more climate responsive by using 
important  aspects  such  as  the  climate 
risk  code,  climate  resources,  climate  zone, 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  97
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)and heat island. In addition, the climate resilience strategy also prioritizes 
the concept of space allocation and utilization, in which the protection and 
utilization are based on capacity and needs. Furthermore, adaptation actions as 
an important part of climate resilience should also decrease GHGs emissions 
as a co-benefit mitigation effort, with a focus on adaptation in 6 areas (water, 
food, energy, environmental health, ecosystem, disaster) in accordance with 
the NDC adaptation strategy.
Through the LTS-LCCR 2050, efforts to achieve climate resilience are carried 
out  by  mapping  modalities,  through  strengthening  capacities  in  natural 
resources,  governance,  culture  and  local  wisdom.  The  mapping  of  these 
modalities  focuses  on  several  components,  including  challenges  (climate 
change impacts), strategies (NDC road maps), potential benefits (resilience to 
basic necessities), synergy in regional and sectoral pathways, and stakeholder 
participation. The mapping of modalities to achieve climate resilience is also 
focused on community welfare targeting vulnerable groups. The target is 
translated into several aspects, including literacy and adaptive technology, 
percentage of renewable energy, ecosystem based analysis unit, and climate 
resources utilization.
Figure 39. The scheme LTS-LCCR 2050 on adaptation 
98 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)The process in translating all climate resilience components as reflected in 
Figure 39 is in the early stage. Therefore, climate resilience pathways were 
developed by using two approaches namely regional and sectoral approaches 
(see Figure 40). The regional pathway focuses on the priority areas to implement 
adaptation actions based on several basic necessities (food, water, energy, 
and environmental health), taking into account the aspect of climate, climate 
sensitive, non-climate sensitive, and social economy. Adaptation actions under 
the sectoral pathway also used the same basic necessities as the regional 
pathway. 
Figure 40. Adaptation pathways
5.1. Regional Pathway
Regional pathway focuses on the priority areas to implement the adaptation 
actions based on several basic necessities such as food, water, energy, and 
environmental health (see Figure 41). The basic analysis on the development 
of regional pathway is the climate change hotspot, as the Pathway focuses on 
the activities in the regions that are impacted by climate change. The Pathway, 
then, is combined with priority areas to identify regions that are mostly affected 
by climate change, which can be used to determine the priority regions for 
adaptation interventions. 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  99
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)Figure 41. Regional pathway of LTS-LCCR 2050 on adaptation 
The priority regions are the most vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate 
change which should be reviewed on a regional scale. The priority regions 
can be analysed based on the vulnerability index data and climate hotspot. 
The vulnerability index (SIDIK)9 is built by using flood and drought risk maps, 
socio-economic data, and environmental infrastructure. Meanwhile, the basis 
for determining climate hotspots is a commitment to maintaining an increase 
in the earth’s temperature below 2oC with a mitigation target of reducing GHG 
emissions. Climate hotspots are mapped based on regional conditions that 
have the potential to experience a temperature increase of 2oC from baseline 
conditions, thus the future temperatures will reach more than 35oC. 
Figure 42 is an example of the vulnerability map that is overlaid with the 
climate change hotspot by using scenario RCP 4.5 with the CSIRO model. 
Overlay of climate hotspot maps with vulnerability maps is carried out with the 
consideration of not all regions that are potentially exposed to climate hotspots 
are considered vulnerable. For instance, settlements in flood-prone cities have

are potentially exposed to climate change and are included in the category of 
vulnerable regions.

temperatures > 35oC and >2oC increase from baseline conditions
5.2. Sectoral Pathway
Sectoral pathway was developed through mapping modalities used in NDC 
including identification of priority areas, key programs, strategies and strategic 
pillars, and adaptation programmes in various sectors (see Figure 43).

The targets and objectives of various fields in the NDC are elaborated through 
various key programs as an effort to increase resilience in the economic, social 
and livelihood fields, as well as in ecosystems and landscapes (see Figure 44). 
Efforts to translate NDC commitments into adaptation actions are formulated 
through the NDC Road map strategy consisting of adaptation action pillars with 
indicators to see the results of adaptation activities. Furthermore, the pillars of 
the Road map strategy can become a direction for planning adaptation action 
programs contained in multi-sectoral actions which are used as input towards 
LTS-LCCR 2050 in the aspect of adaptation.

the value of a proportion to the national GDP 
Figure 44 explains the impact of climate change on national GDP in the basic 
necessities (food, water, energy, and health). The impact on energy, food, and 
water was the result of a dynamic calculation analysis using climate change 
projections for Indonesia which were translated into sensitivity analysis of an 
increase in temperature of 1 to 3 degrees and a change in rainfall of -30 to 
30% from the baseline condition. Meanwhile, the impact on the health sector 
was analysed based on the changed area affected by vector borne disease 
simulated using projected climates from the CSIRO and MIROC climate models 
in the RCP 4.5 scenario.
The economic impact of climate change on food demand used the calculation 
of the productivity of rice plant during planting seasons 1, 2 and 3. The analysis 
was completed using historical climate data from 1991 to 2020, and projected 
climate  change  on  temperature  and  rainfall  for  2021-2050.  The  analysis 
suggested a decrease in rice productivity can affect the GDP of the agricultural 
sector by around 4.71% - 32.36%, which is corresponding to 0.18% to 1.26% of the 
National GDP. The estimated impacts on water resources were assumed based 
on changes in water balance due to changes in projected rainfalls in Indonesia. 
The economic losses are equivalent to about 0.33 - 0.43% of the National GDP. 
The assessment of the impacts of climate change on energy is assumed to be 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  103
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)based on energy demand and supply which was calculated based on the total 
costs required to increase the demand for air conditioning to maintain comfort 
environmental livings and the energy costs of Hydroelectric Power (PLTA) due 
to changing rainfall. It is projected that the energy sector will experience losses 
up to about 0.002% GDP. For maintaining healthy environment, the impacts 
were calculated based on the changes in number of vectors borne diseases, 
which were estimated to about 1.86% GDP. These economic estimations are 
assumed only to account for projected climate change on continuous events 
such as changing rainfalls and temperature. The impacts of climate extremes, 
which may pose challenges to climate related disasters causing infrastructure 
damages and people displacement, and damages on environmental function 
and services can generate much higher economic losses. The economic 
impacts of climate change were completed with a sensitivity analysis (Table 
3) to accommodate a variety of climate change projections in Indonesia, and 
presented in estimated impacts on GDP for temperature increase from 1.0oC to 
3.0oC with a corresponding rainfall change from -30 to 30%.

(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)The sensitivity analysis suggested that future climate change can have an

to about 3.45% GDP by 2050. This analysis does not take into account the 
COVID-19 outbreak of 2020-2021, concerning there will be bias and become 
the top loss in the analysis of the impacts of climate change.
Planning and implementing adaptation in sectoral pathway must be conducted 
based on basic necessities (see Figure 45). It is also important to avoid 
mal-adaptation that potentially occur if the adaptation is carried out without 
coordination  amongst  sectors.  The  synergy  between  sectoral  ministries/
agencies is needed in climate change adaptation. All sectors should also 
consider cross-cutting issues, such as knowledge management sharing (i.e., 
increasing literacy) and community engagement for local climate actions. As a 
real example, Indonesia will continue to strengthen climate change actions of 
the community through PROKLIM implementation, in parallel with the adoption 
of low carbon lifestyle.

(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)5.3. Cost of Adaptation Pathways 
Referring to the impacts of climate change which can affect 0.66% to 3.45% 
of national GDP or around IDR 110.38 T to 577.01 T (2020 value, without 
considering the incidence of COVID-19), the estimated need for adaptation 
costs to climate change in Indonesia reaches at least about IDR 33.12 T to 173.10 
T (assuming an investment ratio of 30%) to IDR 577.01 T (assuming the same 
amount of investment as the impact costs). Funding needs for adaptation are 
divided into two parts, namely funding for road map governance (5% - 10%) and 
funding for adaptation implementation (90% - 95%). The first funding group 
is  more  towards  initiating,  managing,  coordinating,  reporting,  monitoring, 
and evaluating the proposed adaptation actions, and the second one is the 
estimated costs required to implement the adaptation actions. Illustration of 
funding requirements for the implementation can be seen in Figure 46. 
Figure 46. Illustration of funding requirements for climate change adaptation
As for funding for the road map governance (i.e., enabling condition for the 
implementation of adaptation actions), the estimated total funding required 
is about IDR 12.84 trillion. The largest allocation of funding needs is needed 
for the adaptive technology implementation strategy (~27.19%), while the least 
amount is for policy formulation and strengthening commitment by 2.24%. 
The estimation was carried out by considering the resource requirements for

INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  109
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)6.1.  Prerequisites for Successful Implementation 
of LTS-LCCR
Government of Indonesia has made considerable efforts to achieve the target 
under the Paris Agreement. A number of innovative policies and measures are 
in place to support transformation in food and land-use systems to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions and pollutant, reduce vulnerability and increase 
adaptive capacity to climate change, conserve biodiversity, promote healthy 
diets, strengthen rural livelihoods, sustainable use of freshwater resources, 
as well as to halt the loss of ecosystem services. Government Regulation 
No. 46/2016 provides rules and procedures for National and Sub-national 
governments  in  undertaking  Strategic  Environmental  Assessment  (KLHS), 
especially for spatial planning. The regulation provides a strong legal basis 
for  integrated,  comprehensive,  spatially  explicit  land  use  planning  at  the 
national and sub-national level, by adopting landscape-based approach for 
food, water, and energy securities based on sound ecosystem management 
environmentally,  socially  and  economically.  In  energy  sector,  policies  and 
programmes on renewable energy has encouraged various development of 
renewable power plants, production and use of biofuels. For the past five years, 
CPO-based biofuel development has shown considerable progress due to 
biofuel policy including price subsidy using budget collected from the biofuel 
feedstock producer.  
In the means of implementation, the Government of Indonesia has put into effect 
Government Regulation No. 46/2017 on Economic Instrument for Environment, 
followed by the establishment of Environmental Fund Management Agency 
(BPDLH) through Presidential Regulation No. 77/2018 on Environmental Fund 
Management. Furthermore, Presidential Regulation on Management of Carbon 
Economy to achieve NDC target and oversight of emission in development 
(Id. Penyelenggaraan Nilai Ekonomi Karbon untuk Pencapaian Target NDC dan 
Pengendalian Emisi Karbon dalam Pembangunan Nasional) is in the process of 
finalization. 
110 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)In the pathway scenarios for AFOLU, successful transition from CPOS to LCCP 
required several prerequisites. In both CPOS and LCCP, significant emission 
reduction occurs due to significant decrease in deforestation and peat related 
emission, followed by an increase in carbon sequestration from secondary forest, 
afforestation and reforestation. However, as population increase, the demand 
for land use, either for housings, livestock, or crops will also increase. Proper 
mapping and balance of land use across Indonesia’s geography will be a key 
prerequisite, including consideration of trajectory of changes in population and 
the need to avoid deforestation during the development planning. Furthermore, 
development of infrastructures to create better environment for investment is 
required to comply with land use planning and guided by environmental impact 
assessment. 
In energy sector, the planned mitigation actions involve promotion of one type 
of approach or technology that will lead to emission reduction on the one hand, 
and at the expense of other existing technology on the other. In another case, 
the transformation in energy sector also require support from other sector, 
for example, development of biomass power plants and BECCS will need 
sustainable supply of biofuel feedstock and biomass from land-based sectors.  
In  general,  to  achieve  the  mitigation  targets  under  LCCP,  the  growth  of 
investment is essential. Supportive environment for investment will continuously 
be  strengthened,  including  supportive  policies,  political  stability,  transport 
and infrastructure, as well as efficient financial markets to encourage climate-
conscious investment and incentives for climate-friendly investments. 
Along with COVID-19 pandemic recovery process, taking the good momentum 
for transformational changes, research and promotion of green technology 
which  enable  lower  energy  consumption,  as  well  as  research  in  creating 
sustainable spatial and urban development, and society participation are the 
key parts of the LCCP planning and implementation. 
The LCCP pathway will lead Indonesia to reach peaking of GHGs emissions in 
2030 with net sink in forestry and land uses, and land uses, and with further 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  111
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)exploring opportunity to rapidly progress towards net-zero emission by 2060 or 
sooner. This pathway requires significant emission reduction in energy sector 
to close to zero and increase removals in forestry and other land uses. As the 
consequences, transformational changes in energy, food, and land use systems 
need to address various development targets including minimizing trade-offs 
as well as competing land uses among targets in energy security, food security, 
biodiversity conservation, avoiding deforestation, freshwater use, nitrogen and 
phosphorus uses. 
High political commitment, enhanced coordination and synergy among line 
Ministries, sound think tank, as well as effective engagement of non-state 
actors/non-party stakeholders will be determining factors for the success of 
the LTS-LCCR implementation. Transformational changes will be supported 
by implementation stages of the LCCP and institutional framework which 
allow necessary improvement to be done overtime. Table 4 depicts cross 
cutting issues to be addressed for the successful implementation of the LCCP, 
transformation needed, policy and measures for the required transformation, 
and institutional engagement.

(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)6.2. Strategic Supporting Issues
6.2.1. Just Transition of the Workforce 
Indonesia envisions to achieve a developed and prosperous condition in its 
hundred years of independence. An effective and inclusive transition to low 
greenhouse  gas  emission  and  climate  resilient  development  requires  just 
transition of the workforce, creation of decent work and quality jobs, address the 
needs of gender equality and justice, inter generation and vulnerable groups. 
Therefore, just transition issues will be addressed in synergy with ongoing 
transition towards a developed and prosperous Indonesia. 
In line with the LTS-LCCR objectives to guide the implementation of NDC and the 
development of the subsequent NDCs beyond 2030, interventions to address 
just transition issues are divided into two following phases : (i) pre 2030 (2021-
2030, the period of Indonesia first NDC), and (ii) post 2030 (2031 – 2050, the 
subsequent NDCs). Table 5 describes key interventions to be carried out during 
the first phase (2021 to 2030), along with the transition towards Indonesia 2045 
and 2050 climate goals.

6.2.2. Gender Equality and Women Empowerment
Paris Agreement and the First NDC of Indonesia
Under the Paris Agreement, Parties should, when taking action to address 
climate change, to respect, promote and consider their respective obligations, 
as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational 
equity. The First NDC reiterates this commitment and Indonesia has taken 
significant steps to reduce emissions with participation of party and non-party 
stakeholders (e.g. private sector, civil societies, vulnerable groups, women, 
adat communities / Masyarakat Hukum Adat and local communities, in both 
planning and implementation stages). 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  117
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)National Policies and Regulation 
This commitment on gender equality is in line with Pancasila as foundational 
philosophical theory and the 1945 State Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia 
Article 27: (i) All citizens shall be equal before the law and the government and 
shall be required to respect the law and the government, with no exceptions; 
(ii) Every citizen shall have the right to work and to earn a humane livelihood, 
and (iii) Each citizen shall have the right and duty to participate in the effort of 
defending the state.
Based on these principles, Indonesia ratified the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Along with the ratification of 
the Convention, and considering the impact of discrimination, including social 
exclusion which will create gender inequality when it is combined with gender 
injustice, Indonesia promulgated Presidential Instruction No. 9/2000 regarding 
Gender Mainstreaming into National Development, which have been followed 
up by Ministerial Decrees in most of the Ministries. The gender mainstreaming 
into national development planning including reference for gender responsive 
budget  and  gender  budget  tagging  has  started  since  2015,  with  target 
achievements, among others, in terms of : (i) gender mainstreaming index 
(Indeks Pengarusutamaan Gender/IPG), (ii) gender empowerment index (Indeks 
Pemberdayaan Gender/IDG), (iii) eradication of all forms of violence to woman, 
and (iv) family development index (Indeks Pembangunan Keluarga/IPK).  
The policy implementation since 2015 (RPJM 2015-2019) suggested the need for 
improvement to be taken in RPJM 2020-2024 and beyond, including : (i) gender 
equality and justice in education, (ii) life expectancy, (iii) health, (iv) workforce, 
(v)  economy,  (vi)  political  representation  in  parliament,  (vii)  eradication  of 
domestic violence, and (viii) tackling climate related challenges (access to 
water, energy and sanitation and capacity to face food scarcity and disaster). 
Strategies to be implemented includes : (i) strengthening policy and regulation, 
(ii) accelerating gender mainstreaming, (iii) awareness raising, (iv) enhancing 
role and participation of women in development, and (v) improving network 
and coordination among stakeholders, which are part of ‘National Strategy for 
118 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)Acceleration of Gender Mainstreaming Implementation’. This national strategy 
will be a strong basis for addressing gender issues under LTS-LCCR 2050 and 
Indonesia Vision 2045.   
6.2.3.  Intergenerational Equity and the Needs of People in 
Vulnerable Situations
Based on on Statistic Indonesia’s projection (2015-2045), Indonesia’s population 
will reach 318.95 millions in 2045 with age composition as follows : (i) 0-14 
years (65.98 millions), (ii) 15 – 64 years (207.99 millions), and (iii) 65+ years 
(44.98 millions). With this age composition, well-designed human resource 
management and development is needed for addressing intergenerational 
issues and issues relating to people in vulnerable situations including children, 
aging population, and people with disabilities. 
The vision of One Hundred Years Indonesia (Visi Indonesia 2045) has placed 
human resource development at the first pillar together with science and 
technology advancement with a view to increase human resource quality 
through enhanced education, strong cultural values, improved health and 
quality of life, enhanced productivity and advanced science and technology 
capacity, and wider employment opportunity. 
Children
Indonesia has a strong legal basis on children issues. Since 2002 Indonesia 
has put into effect Law No. 23/2002 on the protection of the rights of children 
which was amended in 2014 by Law No. 35/2014. The Law protects the rights of 
children, including right to live and to grow, has identity and citizenship, obtain 
legal protection, as well as other rights and obligations. A number of Ministerial 
Regulations (Minister of Women Empowerment and Child Protection/KPPPA) 
have  also  been  enforced.  Furthermore,  the  government  has  developed 
National Action Plan on Children Friendly Cities and Municipalities (Rencana 
Aksi Nasional Kota Layak Anak or RAN-KLA) 2021-2024. The RAN-KLA will be a 
strong basis for addressing the needs of children under LTS-LCCR 2050 and 
Indonesia Vision 2045.   
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  119
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)Elderly Population
Statistic Indonesia’s projection 2015-2045 indicated that elderly population 
in Indonesia will reach 19.8% of the total population. Statistic Indonesia (2021) 
shows that elderly population has increased significantly for the last 10 years, 
from 7.59% in 2010 to 9.78% in 2020 or about 26.42 million. It is anticipated that 
economic dependency ratio of this population will reach 53.35% in 2045. 
The government of Indonesia has put into effect Law No. 43/2004 which 
regulate endeavour to enhance social welfare of elderly population as well as 
policies and programmes to enhance quality of elderly’s life.  National Action 
Plan on elderly’s health has been developed in five years basis since 2016, 
taking into account Strategy for healthy elderly population of WHO SEARO 
2013-2018. However, elderly population issues are cross cutting and policies 
and  programmes  relating  to  this  population  fall  under  several  Ministries’ 
responsibility.  Therefore,  synergy  among  line  Ministries  will  determine  the 
effectiveness in the implementation the policies and programmes. 
The Law No. 43/2004, policies and programmes to address elderly population 
issues by different responsible Ministries, and lessons learned for the past years 
will be the basis to align the policies and programmes with LTS-LCCR 2050 as 
well as Indonesia Vision 2045.  
People with Disabilities 
Issues relating to people with disabilities are cross cutting and addressed under 
a number of regulatory frameworks and programmes. There are a number of 
Laws that regulate or address people with dissabilities issues, for example, (i) Law 
concerning human rights (Law No. 39/1999); (ii) Ratification of the Convention 
on the rights of persons with disabilities (Law No. 19/2011); (iii) building (Law 
No. 28/2002, employment (Law No. 13/2003), national education system (Law 
No. 13/2003); (iv) traffic and road transport (Law No. 22/2009); (v) Ratification 
Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities (Law No. 19/2011); and (vi) 
Law No. 8/2016 which address specifically the needs of people with disabilities. 
Other regulatory frameworks and National Action Plan to enhance inclusiveness 
120 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)of people with disabilities in justice, work, infrastructure, politic, economy, public 
health and others have been in place. Similar to other issues, existing laws and 
other regulatory frameworks are strong basis for addressing the people with 
disabilities under LTS-LCCR 2050 and Indonesia Vision 2045.
6.2.4. Masyarakat Hukum Adat (MHA) and Local Communities
Masyarakat Hukum Adat/Adat community and Local Community (in this case 
community living in and surrounding forest) and their rights are recognized 
under Forestry Law (Law No. 41/1999). Adat forest based on Forestry Law is part 
of state forest. However, the Constitutional Court ruling in 201211 recognized 
Adat forest as part of Right Forest (Hutan Hak) which is by definition under the 
Forestry Law is forest which is located in the areas with land title. The Ministry 
of Environment and Forestry (MoEF) has followed up the 2012 Constitutional 
Court ruling with a number of policy interventions including the enactment of 
Ministerial Regulation12 concerning Adat Forest and Right Forest. Under Forestry 
Law, Adat Forest need to obtain legal recognition in the form of District-level 
regulation and/or Decree of the Head of District. The MoEF recorded that up to 
mid 2020, about 0.96 Mha of Adat Forest has obtained legal recognition which 
are managed by 36,579 Adat households, spreading into thirteen provinces in 
five major islands (Sumatera, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Java and Bali). With their 
nature of relationship with forest resources, local wisdom and experiences in 
managing forest resources on the one hand, and role of forestry and other 
land use sector in contributing to Indonesia’s commitment under the Paris 
Agreement on the other hand, Adat community and Local Community will play 
strategic roles in reducing GHGs emissions and in building resilience under 
LTS-LCCR.

(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)VII. INTERNATIONAL 
PARTNERSHIP 
7.1. Trade and Investment 
Indonesia  considers  global  partnership  for 
fair trades and green investments is one of 
key drivers for the achievement of the Paris 
Agreement’s goal. The relationship between 
trade policy and the environment has become 
stronger over time, which on the one hand is 
positive for environment and compatible with 
the  Paris  Agreement,  on  the  other  hand  it 
has posed challenges within the diversity of 
circumstances, capacities and capabilities of 
trading partner countries. 
As a country with major export of land-based 
commodities,  more  specifically  agricultural 
products (palm oils, natural rubber, coconut, 
cacao, coffee) and wood products, Indonesia 
has faced challenges in obtaining a fair-trade 
deal at the global market and in balancing 
between maintaining agricultural export and 
implementing  the  transformation  into  less 
carbon approaches. The strategy for avoiding 
deforestation  while  maintaining  agricultural 
export  target  is  in  line  with  international 
market demand that production of agricultural 
export commodities (e.g. biofuel) does not 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  123
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)cause deforestation through indirect land use change (ILUC). The extended 
moratorium policies in granting new permit on peatland facilitates continuous 
reductions in deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as increase 
opportunity to achieve export target. 
Global partnership in green investment is also a strategy in reducing GHG 
emissions.  Corporate  research  and  investment  in  renewable  energy  and 
low-carbon fuels will help rapid market growth in green/clean technologies. 
To  create  a  supportive  ecosystem  for  promoting  environmentally  sound 
technologies, the existing international regulatory and political framework for 
trade and investment in such technologies needs to be re-visited. One of the 
essential actions is to remove barriers to trade on renewable energy goods. 
Other supports in creating good investment ecosystems such as regulations 
and  good  legal  capacity,  capacity  to  enforce  good  laws  (e.g.  intellectual 
property rights), and infrastructures development are also critical. 
The recent Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP which was 
signed by 15 nations including Indonesia provides trade opportunities towards 
sustainable and environmental trading provision. RCEP would connect about 
30% of the world’s population along with the appropriate trade negotiations. It 
will generate significant gains by expanding production of goods and services 
while allowing for optimal use of the world’s resources in accordance with the 
objective of sustainable development. In order to contribute to the effectiveness 
of RCEP implementation, the government will create a trading and investment 
environments which promote sustainable supply chain initiatives, product 
certification and potential future means to address unsustainable production 
practices.
7.2. Research
Research plays crucial role to support mitigation actions under LCCP and in 
building resilience under adaptation pathways. LCCP requires transformational 
changes in all five mitigation sectors with AFOLU and energy as the major 
contributors to the net-zero emission target. The most ambitious pathway 
124 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)scenario (LCCP) also indicates the needs for research in a number of areas. Low 
carbon farming, food handling and processing to reduce food loss, the extent 
of contribution of ocean in mitigation and adaptation are among priority areas 
of research to support transition in nature-based sector. Research to support 
sustainability transition in all sectors will also needed. 
Indonesia will strengthen research collaboration among institutions within 
the country and national institutions with international partners, including 
think tanks and research institutions. There has been positive trend on the 
role  of    think  tanks  and  research  institutions  in  supporting  governments, 
such as in improving public knowledge and engagement, providing issue-
focused research, evidence-based policy advice to encourage greater action 
by non-state actors, ‘push’ and ‘pull’ private sectors towards greater climate 
ambition, assess the effectiveness of existing policies and identify solutions, 
and coordinating national and international expertise.
7.3. Technology Cooperation 
LCCP indicates the necessities of technology transformation to achieve the 
target set under the scenario, both for AFOLU sector (technology to increase 
productivity under emission reduction target, e.g. for mechanization, agricultural 
inputs, land management) and other sectors (energy, IPPU, waste). In energy 
sector, the strategy to achieve the target under LCCP suggested the focus 
on power sector, which requires transition from heavily coal-based energy to 
more diversified energy sources, including development of renewable energy 
system for power. IPPU and waste sectors, despite the small contribution to 
the overall LTS-LCCR target, under the LCCP these two sectors also require 
changes in technology with different levels of advancement.  
With the ambitious target for the LTS-LCCR, Indonesia seeks opportunity for 
technology cooperation under the framework of technology development 
and transfer of the Paris Agreement and the Convention. Indonesia considers 
technology  cooperation  under  this  framework  as  a  key  element  for  the 
ambitious scenario of the LTS-LCCR. 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  125
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)7.4. Finance Flows 
LTS-LCCR implies the needs for finance flows that facilitate the achievement of 
emission reduction target towards the net-zero emission goal while enabling 
economic  growth,  green  recovery  from  COVID-19  pandemic  and  climate 
resilience, within the just principles in development. The analysis which was 
carried out during the development of the LTS-LCCR suggested that positive 
economic growth under emission reduction target can be achieved, however, 
additional  investment  will  be  needed  to  support  the  mitigation  actions. 
Additional investment is crucial to increase productivity in AFOLU sector (e.g. 
for mechanization, agricultural inputs, land management, as well as research 
and development) and for technology adoption in energy sector (e.g. in order 
to increase energy efficiency and adopt CCS technology). 
Financing  strategy  for  climate  mitigation  and  adaptation  in  Indonesia  is 
currently at the preliminary stage of development. The concept of financing 
strategy  is  built  with  the  assumption  that  the  finance  needs  for  climate 
actions should be addressed by optimizing climate finance system, starting 
from finance sources, finance institutions and their mechanisms as well as 
institutions receiving finance to carry out programmes/activities to achieve the 
set target. Therefore, the current efforts as part of the financing strategy for 
climate mitigation and adaptation includes increasing diversification of sources 
of finance, strengthening capacity of finance institutions, and strengthening 
capacity of stakeholders in accessing finance. The government of Indonesia 
has taken a number of policies that open opportunity to increase diversification 
of finance sources from both national and international – public and private 
sources. At the national level, the opportunities to optimise state budget are  
explored (e.g. using instruments of green sukuk or green bonds and draft of 
PERPRES NEK on Carbon Pricing Instruments such as fees and carbon levy;  
instruments of intergovernmental fiscal transfer; instruments of PAD and other 
sources of income).   Furthermore, Indonesia continue to mobilise international 
financial sources through bilateral, regional, and multilateral channels, including 
result-based payment for REDD+ under the Paris Agreement, grant, and other 
potential sources and mechanisms. 
126 INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY 
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)7.5. Capacity Development
Indonesia has a long history of collaboration in capacity development especially 
through ODA schemes in various areas including climate change. There has 
been increasing trends in climate-related capacity development programme 
for the past 20 years, both as a stand-alone programme and as part of a broader 
scope of cooperation. Rapid development in capacity building programmes 
around the world has occurred since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 
various forms including through establishment of platforms or partnership 
which address specific issues such as NDC preparation and implementation,  
preparation  of  long-term  strategy  on  low  carbon  development,  capacity 
building  initiative  for  transparency  (CBIT),  Paris  Agreement  Transparency 
Partnership and Mutual Learning Programme which is organized by IGES and 
many others. 
Along with initiatives under the Capacity Building Hub of the UNFCCC, the needs 
to enhance synergy and transformational changes in capacity development 
has also been more obvious at the national level, as implied in the mitigation 
and adaptation pathway scenarios. For example, the transition in energy sector 
which requires transition of the workforce to green jobs will need well- designed 
capacity development; similarly for other mitigation sectors, adaptation, and 
for addressing cross cutting issues (incl. just transition, gender, intergeneration 
and vulnerable groups, MHA and local communities). An integrated approach 
in capacity development to support the LTS-LCCR will be developed and 
aligned with capacity development to progress towards Prosperous Indonesia 
2045. International support for capacity building under the Paris Agreement 
and the Convention will continue to be mobilised to support the achievement 
of the ambitious target under LCCP of LTS-LCCR.

(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)VIII. IMPLEMENTATION 
APPROACH 
During the period of 2021-2030, implementation 
of LTS-LCCR will follow the implementation of 
first NDC (Updated NDC), which is guided by nine 
NDC  Implementation  Strategy  Programmes 
as  described  in  Updated  NDC  document. 
Presidential Regulation on Carbon Pricing (draft 
of PERPRES NEK) sets norms for four following 
main  areas:  (1)  NDC  target  achievement,  (2) 
carbon economic instrument, (3) transparency 
framework, and (4) low carbon development.  
The draft of PERPRES-NEK also regulates the 
roles of Parties and Non-Party Stakeholders in 
the NDC implementation.  Under this regulation, 
the  NDC  will  be  implemented  by  national 
government,  sub-national  governments 
(provinces, districts and cities), private sectors, 
and  communities.  Furthermore,  NDC  Road 
Maps  (mitigation,  adaptation,  and  means  of 
implementation)  provide  detail  guidance  on 
policy,  programme,  and  actions  to  achieve 
2030 target of the NDC, as well as periodic 
monitoring and evaluation of the progress and 
achievement during this period. 
INDONESIA LONG-TERM STRATEGY  129
FOR LOW CARBON AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE 2050
(INDONESIA LTS-LCCR 2050)Through ambitious pathway (LCCP) Indonesia will reach peaking in emission 
in 2030 with net sink in forestry and land use, and with further exploring 
opportunity  to  rapidly  progress  towards  net-zero  emission  by  2060  or 
sooner. Hence, the implementation of LTS-LCCR post 2030 will follow the 
implementation of the corresponding NDC. Development of post 2030 NDC 
shall be in line with the set target and other guidance under LTS-LCCR, taking 
into account relevant regulatory frameworks and policies. 
Effective engagement of non-party stakeholders (NPS) will be a key driver of 
successful implementation of the LTS-LCCR. Therefore, taking into account 
relevant regulatory frameworks and policies, the mechanism for enhancing the 
effectiveness of NPS engagement will be continuously improved.
