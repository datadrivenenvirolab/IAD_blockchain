THE VISION – A climate-neutral 
Austria in 2050 
A comprehensive long-term strategy needs a clear vision. The future will be what we make of 
it, not a given state. A long-term path requires an appealing and inspiring long-term vision. 
Austria has set the goal of being climate-neutral by no later than 2050 – this is our vision. 
A strategy that includes a comprehensive transformation of both our energy supply and our 
consumption patterns and that includes an adapted but competitive economic system goes far 
beyond of merely reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It must contain all three pillars of 
sustainability –economic, social, and environmental aspects – as this is the only way to achieve 
committing to far-reaching changes by the population. Resource saving, sustainable and 
innovative technologies and the circular economy are key elements to achieve the goal.  
The development of this vision, the design of the strategy, the definition, the implementation 
and review of concrete measures is a core task of politicians and public administration. At the 
same time, the business community is an important partner for achieving the energy and 
climate  transformation.  Our  vision,  which  aims  to  facilitate  an  energy  transformation, 
sustainable consumption patterns, and an inclusive economic system can only be achieved 
through technological progress and creative and innovative business models that allow people 
to benefit while using less resources. This ultimately means a structural change that will affect 
all aspects of our lives – but this beginning shall be an opportunity to actively shape our future 
and develop innovations and new ways of thinking.  
5 
  
1  OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY 
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 
1.1  Legal and political framework  
1.1.1  The international framework 
The Paris Agreement was adopted in December 2015 and entered into force on 4 November 
2016. It is the first ambitious and legally binding agreement at global level that contains 
commitments  for  all  signatory  countries  regarding  climate  action.  The  most  important 
features of the agreement and the accompanying decision are: 
  Temperature goal: Global warming should be limited to well under 2°C, and efforts 
should be taken to limit the warming to 1.5°C. 
  Adaptation goal: The ability to adapt to the negative consequences of climate change 
should be increased and climate-resilient and low-emission development should be 
promoted. 
  Financing goal: Financial flows should be brought in line with low-emission and 
climate-resilient development. 
  Long-term goal: Global greenhouse gas emissions should reach their global peak as 
soon as possible and then decline rapidly to achieve a balance between greenhouse gas 
emissions and carbon sequestration (e.g. in forests) in the second half of this century. 
This equates to achieving zero net emissions after  2050, i.e. the comprehensive 
replacement of fossil fuels. 
  Long-term plans: All signatories are encouraged to submit plans for long-term low-
emission development. 
  Climate action measures: All signatories are required to submit nationally determined 
contributions (NDCs) every five years, with the requirement that new NDCs shall be 
more ambitious than the ones they replace. Developing countries are encouraged to 
move towards absolute, comprehensive goals. The signatories are also urged to submit 
long-term low-emission strategies by 2020. 
  Evaluation of the level of ambition: The first NDCs that were submitted are not 
ambitious enough to be on the 2°C target path (roughly 2.7 to 3.2°C). Hence, a regular 
stocktaking will be carried out. The first stocktake will be conducted in 2023 and will be 
6 
  
repeated every five years. The Paris Agreement shall be strengthened to guarantee a 
global transition to sustainable energy technologies.   
The Agreement not only initiated the exit from fossil fuels, but also a global transformation of 
our energy systems, economy and society.  
The IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels 
and related global greenhouse gas emission and the difference to an increase of 2°C reinforces 
the imperative nature of this transformation.1  
Key global action areas addressed in the special report are: 
  Reduction of the carbon intensity of electricity generation to zero and substantial 
reduction of total energy consumption by the middle of the century, plus an increased 
share of electricity to meet energy demand. 
  Increase in the production of renewable energy (bioenergy, water, wind, solar) by 60% 
from 2020 to 2030. Increase of primary energy generation from renewable sources to 
49–67% by 2050. 
  Change in land use to meet the competing demands of housing development, food 
production, livestock farming, bioenergy, biodiversity and ecosystem functions.  
  Industry emissions are 70–90% lower in 2050 than in 2010. 
  Substantial emission reductions need to be achieved for transport and buildings by 
2050. This will be achieved through technical measures (such as increased energy 
efficiency and electrification) as well as through lifestyle changes that lead to reduced 
energy consumption (such as using bicycles and walking).  
Even a 1.5°C global temperature increase would have serious consequences, such as: 
  More extreme weather events (such as heat waves, heavy precipitation, and extreme 
droughts). 
  Negative impacts on ecosystems (up to extinction of species) and in the areas of 
healthcare, drinking water supply, and food production. 
  A substantial and irreversible rise in the sea level. 
 
The effects of climate change on sustainable development, on efforts to eradicate poverty and 
inequality can be reduced if we limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C instead of 2°C. If choices 
are made carefully and the respective national conditions are taken into account, adaptation 
strategies can be drafted in a way that they also contribute to sustainable development and

reducing poverty. Adaptations will be required in many sectors of the economy (energy 
generation, industry and transport systems). 
The temperature increase in Austria is around twice the global average, for example as 
documented in the first Austrian climate status report. The temperature increase is generally 
greater over land than over the oceans. The average temperature in Austria is already around 
2°C higher than at the end of the 19th century.  
Systemic changes will be needed to mitigate the risks that global warming of 1.5°C poses to 
the SDGs and to fight against poverty. This includes the redirection of financial flows towards 
measures that reduce emissions or result in relevant adaptation. This involves various areas of 
policy such as energy systems and infrastructure.  
Sustainable development supports or rather paves the way for fundamental social changes and 
system transformations which contribute to limiting global warming to 1.5°C.  
1.1.2  Framework in the European Union 
1.1.2.1  The EU climate and energy targets for 2030 
In 2014 the European Union (EU) adopted a binding EU-wide greenhouse gas reduction target 
of at least 40% compared with 1990 levels for the period from 2021 to 2030. This target was 
also included in the EU’s first nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris 
Agreement. 
The implementation in the EU is taking place through the emissions trading scheme as well as 
through effort sharing by the sectors not covered by emissions trading (transport, buildings, 
trade, agriculture, waste management, fluorinated greenhouse gases). According to the 
amended Emissions Trading Directive (Directive [EU] 2018/410), the facilities tracked in the 
system are to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 43% compared with 2005 levels by 
2030, which means a linear reduction of 2.2 percentage points per year starting in 2021 (2013–
2020: -1.74%). For sectors not covered by emissions trading, the new Effort Sharing Regulation 
(EU) 2018/842 requires a 30% reduction compared with 2005 by no later than 2030, with the 
individual Member States being required to make contributions ranging between 0 and -40%, 
primarily dependent upon per capita GDP. Austria’s reduction target is 36%. The adoption of 
the LULUCF Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry) will add the 
sector of land use to the EU reduction target starting in 2021, meaning that all material sectors 
of the economy are now covered by the climate policy. 
8 
  
The European Commission (EC) presented the Clean Energy Package in November 2017. This 
set of laws, that consists of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, the amended 
Renewable Energy Directive and Energy Efficiency Directive, and the regulation on the 
governance of the Energy Union and a modernised electricity market design (regulation and 
directive), defines targets of at least 32% energy from renewable sources and at least a 32.5% 
improvement in energy efficiency for the period from 2021 to 2030.  
Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 
2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action requires the Member States 
to submit a national energy and climate plan starting from 2021 to 2030 by 31 December 2019 
and a long-term strategy 2050 by 1 January 2020.  
1.1.2.2  A clean planet for all 
On 28 November 2018, the EC presented the communication  titled “A clean planet for all – A 
European strategic long-term vision for a prosperous, modern, competitive and climate neutral 
economy” together with an in-depth analysis (COM [2018] 773).  
The communication presents a vision and long-term strategy (LTS) for European climate and 
energy policy on the basis of eight scenarios to illustrate how zero net greenhouse gas 
emissions can be achieved by 2050 cost effectively and with the help of a socially just transition. 
The  eight  scenarios  describe  the  modelling  of  different  technical  solutions  for  cutting 
emissions. Six of these aim at emission reductions of 80–90%, and two present the path to 
climate neutrality. The strategy encompasses all key sectors including energy, buildings, 
transport, industry, agriculture, and land use in a broader sense and is aligned with the goal of 
the Paris Agreement to limit the temperature increase to well below 2°C and to continue 
striving to stabilise it at 1.5°C.  
Austria advocated for the EU reaching climate-neutrality/zero net emissions by 2050 at the 
European Council in June 2019 and December 2019, though Austria rejects the contribution of 
atomic energy and carbon capture and storage (CCS, prohibited in Austria due to unresolved 
safety questions) and takes a critical view of the role of natural sinks in reaching climate 
neutrality. 
Together with Luxembourg, Ireland, and Lithuania, Austria addressed a letter to the EC with 
an appeal to present a 100% “renewables” zero net scenario by 2050, as all scenarios presented 
by the EC to date include atomic energy. The response from the EC sees the presentation of 
such a scenario as interference in the rights of the Member States in terms of the free choice 
9 
  
of national energy resources. For Austria, the presentation of such a scenario is solely intended 
to assess its feasibility.   
1.1.3  Framework in Austria 
1.1.3.1  Climate Change Act 
The Climate Change Act (KSG) was passed in 2011 to facilitate the attainment of the objective 
for 2020 and serves as a basis for  
  specifying maximum annual quantities in six sectors (waste, energy and industry 
outside of the ETS, fluorinated greenhouse gases, buildings, agriculture, transport),  
  drafting a provincial/federal measures list in these sectors, and  
  allocating costs (provinces/federal government) in the event of missed targets. 
  
The provincial and federal governments drew up an initial concrete set of measures for the 
years 2013 to 2018 on the basis of the KSG.  
1.1.3.2  National energy and climate plan for the period from 2021 to 2030 
Austria is moving towards a transformation to a highly efficient and climate-neutral energy, 
mobility, and economic system along the entire energy value production chain (generation, 
transport, conversion, consumption), including all associated products and services. This is why 
it is important to draw a clear picture of how the business community and society can make 
the best use of the resulting opportunities. 
According to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the 
Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action, all Member States are required to 
prepare national energy and climate plans (NECPs) for the period from 2021 to 2030. 
The draft of the Austrian plan was submitted to the European Commission by the Federal 
Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism (BMNT) in good time, at the end of 2018. This is based 
on #mission2030, Austria’s integrated climate and energy strategy. 
The Commission issued ten concrete recommendations for this draft on 18 June 2019, which 
were taken into account in the finalisation of the plan by the end of 2019.  
10 
  
Between July and December 2019, the BMNT incorporated the recommendations of the 
Commission and other updates into the plan in collaboration with the directly affected 
ministries (BMVIT, BMF). The public consultation on the NECP required by the Governance 
Regulation was held in November 2019. An impact assessment for the planned measures was 
also concluded as part of the final plan (scenario “with additional measures”). 
The Austrian national plan includes the following objectives by 2030: 
•  Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 36% compared with 2005 levels in 
sectors that are not covered by the EU emissions trading system; 
•  Increase of the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption to 46–
50%; 
•  Coverage of 100% of domestic electricity consumption from renewable sources 
(national, net balance, with exceptions for control and balancing energy for grid 
stabilisation and internal electricity generation from fossil fuels in tangible goods 
production); 
•  Improvement of primary energy intensity, defined as primary energy use per GDP 
unit, by 25–30% compared with 2015. 
Key political questions, especially those relating to necessary investments and associated 
public financing today and key political questions that focus on instrument selection in the 
future (such as financial incentives, regulatory policy, tax-related control mechanisms and the 
trading system) will be addressed and resolved by a new federal government as soon as 
possible. 
1.1.4  The Austrian goal – climate neutrality by 2050 
Austria is committed to becoming climate neutral by no later than 2050, without using nuclear 
power.  This  means  that  the  unavoidable  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (for  example  from 
agriculture and production processes) will be compensated by carbon storage in natural or 
technical sinks. This is the guiding principle of the long-term climate strategy 2050.  
1.1.5  Consultation 
1.  Online consultation  
A public online consultation with questions on the objectives and action areas for the long-
term climate strategy 2050 was held in summer 2019 (5 August to 22 September). The target 
group  was  interested  members  of  the  general  public.  Of  the  2,768  participants,  1,060 
submitted a complete or partial evaluation of the questions. 
11 
  
The responses indicated that there is a high level of acceptance and demand for an ambitious 
strategy in general. 
Different objectives were assessed in terms of their “relevance for the overarching goal of 
climate neutrality by 2050” in the online consultation. Participants had the opportunity to rank 
the objectives in terms of feasibility and relevance  
 
 
The objectives that were ranked highest in terms of relevance were: 
  Achieve 100% renewable energy by 2050 
  Ensure clean and affordable mobility 
  Climate-friendly freight traffic 
 
The criteria of time horizon, financeability, acceptance, and impacts were also assessed for a 
series of measures. The result showed that every measure is acceptable (but will entail effort). 
No measure was ranked as unacceptable. 
 
The following measures were ranked as “quick wins” – easy to finance, achievable within the 
next five years, and easy to accept: 
 
  Incorporation of climate action in the educational curriculum 
  Labelling requirements for products 
  Dialogue with retailers on the labelling of food 
  Public relations work and information campaigns 
The following measures were assigned a high priority – with the greatest impact and feasible 
over the long term:  
 
  Energy 
  Gradual reduction of fossil fuels 
  Promotion of renewable energy sources 
  Energy efficiency as savings potential in buildings  
  Climate-neutral mobility 
  Modal shift  
  Reduced air traffic 
  Traffic avoidance 
  Financial levers 
  Implementation of true-cost pricing for products and services 
  Alignment of the tax system with climate-policy goals 
 
12 
  
Detailed results on the individual fields of action can be found in section 2.4 Information 
about specific sectors. 
 
The questions and aggregate rankings can be found in Annex 6.2. 
 
2.  Stakeholder consultation (with three workshops)  
To ensure the close involvement of the relevant stakeholders, three workshops were held with 
these  stakeholders  in  addition  to  the  extensive  online  consultation.  These  workshops 
especially focused on the target visions and the measures and pathways necessary to achieve 
them. Representatives of the relevant federal ministries and of the provincial and municipal 
governments, social partner representatives, members of the Federation of Austrian Industry, 
and representatives of civil society and science participated in these workshops. 
 
At the first workshop in the summer of 2019, the European framework for the long-term 
strategy was presented by a representative of the EU commission. Sector target visions for 
2050 were drafted jointly on this basis. 
 
The second workshop in November 2019 focused on in-depth discussion of the various sectors 
and of the mobility system, the energy system, and overarching topics such as innovation and 
lifecycles and the relevance of consumption patterns. Viable economic concepts were also 
examined to strike the best possible balance between location security and climate-neutral 
business activity. This workshop included the discussion of a just transition to a climate-neutral 
economy and society.  
The third workshop in the middle of December was used to present the results and to have in-
depth discussions on the long-term strategy.  
13 
  
2  THE FIELDS OF ACTION 
2.1  Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and overall 
increase in the removal of these gases via sinks 
2.1.1  Assumed reduction of emissions and increase of removals of 
greenhouse gases by 2050 
Austria intends to achieve a climate-neutral state in terms of its greenhouse gas emissions by 
2050. This means that emissions of greenhouse gases will be close to zero and that remaining 
emissions are to be compensated by carbon capture in natural sinks (forests, soil) and by 
permanent sequestration in products or technical storage. 
2.1.2  National  requirements  for  2030  and  beyond,  if  available,  and 
guidelines for 2040 and 2050 
According to current EU law, Austria is required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 
sectors that are not covered by the EU emissions trading system (ETS) by 36% compared with 
2005 levels by 2030. The CO  emissions from energy-intensive industries and the energy sector 
2
are defined and limited across Europe by a linear pathway in the EU Emissions Trading 
Directive. The emissions covered by the ETS must be reduced by at least 43% compared with 
2005 levels by 2030. There are no national requirements that apply to Member States for the 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ETS facilities. 
Furthermore the LULUCF Regulation defines reference values for the capture of greenhouse 
gases in forests and in agricultural soil. If these reduction targets are not met, the excess 
quantities are to be compensated for by greenhouse gas emission reductions from sources not 
covered by the ETS. Any reductions above and beyond the targets in LULUCF can be deducted 
from non-ETS emissions up to a limit of 2.5 million tonnes (for the ten-year period 2021–2030). 
The pathways for achieving climate neutrality by the middle of this century shown in the 
following section require far-reaching emission reductions in all sectors as quickly as possible. 
A target emission range applying to all emission sources (emissions trading and non-ETS 
sectors) cannot be defined at present because emission reductions in the industrial sources 
covered by the ETS are highly dependent upon developments that can only be influenced to a 
limited  degree  at  the  national  level.  The  goal  to  cover  100%  of  domestic  electricity 
14 
  
consumption from renewable sources (national, net balance, with exceptions for control and 
balancing energy for grid stabilisation and internal electricity generation from fossil fuels in 
tangible goods production) will lead  to a substantial decrease in emissions from public 
electricity generation in any case. Remaining greenhouse gas emissions are to be offset by the 
removal of at least equal quantities of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by 2050 to reach 
the target state of zero net emissions. Ecosystems (natural sinks like forests) can be used for 
this as well as technological solutions such as permanent sequestration in products and 
applications (CCU – carbon capture and utilisation) and the permanent storage of CO  in 
2
geological structures (CCS – carbon capture and storage). Austria sees substantial hurdles and 
uncertainties with these technological solutions in terms of domestic storage capacity and 
ensuring permanent and safe storage. The current legal framework is also relevant here, as the 
storage of CO  in geological structures is prohibited in Austria at least for the time being (until 
2
2023). 
2.1.2.1  Scenarios and pathways for a climate-neutral Austria 
Model-based scenarios and projections make it possible to forecast future energy needs and 
greenhouse  gas  emissions  based  on  specific  assumptions  about  future  technological 
developments, policy choices in terms of steering instruments, and socioeconomic parameters 
(population development, economic growth, energy and CO  prices, etc.). 
2
2.1.2.1.1 Transition scenario 
The Federal Environment Agency models energy and greenhouse gas scenarios together with 
a consortium of Austrian scientific institutions every two years for the BMNT, which then uses 
these scenarios as the basis for meeting the EU reporting obligations under the monitoring 
mechanism (Regulation 525/2013/EC). In addition to the scenarios “with existing measures” 
(WEM) and “with additional measures” (WAM), a “transition scenario” was also calculated in 
2017 and is aimed at depicting the greatest possible emission reductions by 2050 on the basis 
of  domestically  available  resources  and  technologies  and  taking  lifestyle  changes  into 
account.2 
The transition scenario focuses on efficiency and the greatest possible use of domestic 
renewable energy sources while at the same time using resources as sparingly as possible. The 
goal here is a highly efficient and sustainable energy system. Developments are also assumed 
in non-energy sectors that lead to substantial reductions in the emission of methane, nitrous 
oxide, and fluorinated greenhouse gases. A key assumption for the scenario is that not only 
                                                                 
2 Energy and greenhouse gas scenarios in 2030 and 2050, Federal Environment Agency, Vienna 2017 
15 
  
Austria and the EU, but also all other regions of the world take action to comply with the Paris 
Agreement (depending on their degree of industrialisation). The transition scenario is intended 
to serve as a basis for further discussions at the national level.  
The most important areas of action in the transition scenario:  
  Internalisation of the external costs for all energy sources,  
  Strong “sector coupling” in terms of the generation, conversion, and use of energy, 
especially relating to the generation of electricity from renewable sources and the 
storage of this electricity, 
  A  change  in  the  modal  split  in  terms  of  passenger  and  freight  traffic  towards 
environmentally friendly transport modes and vehicles that lead to a substantial 
reduction in the annual distance travelled by car,  
  The heavy promotion of the thermal and energy refurbishment of buildings,  
  A switch to sustainable energy sources and technologies in the industry sector, which 
must be available in the necessary quantities (production, grids, storage), and long-
lasting products designed to implement the circular economy combined with increased 
energy and resource efficiency; steel production will shift from the traditional blast 
furnace process to electricity- and hydrogen-based production over the long term, 
  The  energy  sector  switches  to  electricity  and  district  heating  generation  from 
renewable sources and to the systematic use of waste heat, and  
  The population switches to a more climate-friendly diet while reducing food waste; 
agriculture sees further efficiency increases in using nitrogen (fertiliser management) 
and the funding policy takes greater account of the greenhouse gas effects (Common 
Agricultural Policy and implementation in Austria).  
b 
Key results of the 2019 transition scenario 
The 2017 transition scenario was updated in 2019. Gross domestic energy consumption falls 
from 1,442 PJ to 821 PJ, or around 42% compared with the base year 2017. Final energy use 
decreases to a comparable degree (-44%) from 1,130 PJ to 637 PJ in 2050. The share of 
renewable energy in gross final energy use is increased from a current 33% (2017) to around 
92% (2050). 
Greenhouse gas emissions (total without sinks) are reduced by close to 16 million tonnes of 
CO  equivalents by 2050 in the transition scenario, which is an 80% decrease over 1990. This 
2
would result in annual per capita emissions of 1.66 tonnes of CO  equivalents. 
2
16 
  
The most substantial emissions in 2050 are generated by agriculture and industry (especially 
processes). The energy sector and buildings have very low emissions. The transport sector 
operates largely without fossil fuels in this scenario. 
Such a substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions requires far-reaching changes in 
mobility and energy systems and material changes in lifestyle (such as mobility patterns), diet, 
and other consumption patterns. Nevertheless, climate neutrality is still not achieved, and the 
gap is difficult to bridge with the contribution from natural sinks alone. Along with capturing 
carbon in natural sinks, this gap could largely be bridged by adding two further options or a 
combination of these options: 
  The  import  of  additional  energy  from  renewable  sources  that  can  replace  the 
remaining (also imported) fossil fuels. Biogenic energy sources and electricity and 
hydrogen imports could play a major role in this.  
  Permanent sequestration in products and applications (CCU – carbon capture and 
utilisation) and the permanent storage of CO  in geological structures (CCS – carbon 
2
capture and storage). It must be noted here that secured storage capacity that is 
generally suitable for CO  is very limited in Austria. The current potential domestic 
2
storage capacity is estimated at between 400 and 510 million tonnes of CO , or up to 
2
6.5 times the current annual CO  emissions in Austria. The transport of CO  to storage 
2 2
facilities outside of Austria can be considered as an alternative or long-term solution. 
2.1.2.1.2 Selected results from the climate pathway calculator 
The climate pathway calculator for Austria was developed in 2015 on the basis of the UK carbon 
pathways calculator, and was updated in the second half of 2019. This Excel-based instrument 
allows the depiction of different pathways in terms of energy and greenhouse gas emissions 
through to 2050, with the ability to select different ambition levels for all material action areas 
(for example in terms of the selection of technologies and resources, import/export relations, 
and behavioural patterns). 
The climate pathway calculator allows the flexible depiction of results that allows a certain 
degree of comparison with model-based scenarios provided that the pathways and scenarios 
are based on comparable data sets and socioeconomic assumptions for the future trends 
(especially population, economic growth and structure). 
Working from the model-based transition scenario described above, the Excel-based tool was 
used to select and calculate four different pathway options that all aim at achieving a climate-
neutral state by 2050: 
17 
  
Pathway A is closely aligned with the model-based transition scenario and is based on the high 
use of renewable energy, far-reaching efficiency improvements, and substantial changes in 
consumption patterns (lifestyle). Remaining emissions will be compensated by natural sinks 
(forest) (according to reference scenario R [section 6.1.3]) and by  the moderate use of 
CCS/CCU. 
Pathway B focuses on the (somewhat lower) expansion of renewable energy and efficiency 
improvements as well as on the import of bioenergy and hydrogen for use in multiple sectors 
(industry, transport, heating). A substantially higher degree of CCS/CCU than in pathway A 
must be used to compensate for the remaining emissions. 
Pathway C does without the import of bioenergy and hydrogen, and renewable resources in 
the country including forest and agricultural biomass are used to a high degree. This results in 
a reduction in the forest as a natural carbon sink, in accordance with scenario 1a (section 6.1.3). 
This means that the CCS/CCU option must be used to a relatively high degree to compensate 
for the remaining greenhouse gas emissions. 
Pathway D assumes the needs-oriented import of bioenergy and hydrogen, as in pathway B. 
The use of domestic forest biomass and carbon capture in the forest are assumed as in scenario 
2 (section 6.1.3). For this reason, CCS/CCU are not used.

2.1.3  European framework 
The implementation of such a far-reaching goal as achieving climate neutrality in just over 30 
years is only possible for an open, export-oriented country like Austria if this is done in close 
alignment with the changes in the relevant EU policies in various areas such as climate 
mitigation, adaptation to climate change, energy, finances, industry, agriculture, research, and 
innovation. From this perspective, Austria welcomes the initiative of the new European 
Commission in the context of Green Deal. 
For example, far-reaching structural changes in mobility and energy require corresponding 
changes in the internal market.  
•  The existing CO  fleet agreements should be tightened up on the basis of an early 
2
review in accordance with the decarbonisation path required by the Paris Agreement 
and  long-term  EU  strategy  especially  to  facilitate  a  more  rapid  switch  to 
electromobility for passenger cars and light  and heavy-duty vehicles after 2030 in 
particular. Suggestions for concrete measures include:  
–  Rapid introduction of CO  limits for buses.  
2
–  Create  calculability  for  the  vehicle  industry  by  rapidly  adopting  reduction 
pathways for the period after 2030. 
•  Move forward with the amendment of the Eurovignette Directive to achieve true-cost 
pricing in road freight traffic by internalising external costs (such as taking  CO  
2
emissions into account, eliminating the maximum levels regarding the charging of 
external costs, and the requirement for all Member States to collect external costs on 
routes with high environmental impacts). 
•  Amendment of the VAT Directive, especially the tax exemption for cross-border 
carriage.  
•  In air traffic, CORSIA should be implemented in the existing emissions trading system 
(ETS) as far as possible or in a complementary manner to the ETS.  
•  The direct addition of alternative fuels in air traffic should be mandatory over the 
medium term.  
•  Completion of the Single European Sky. 
•  Gradual elimination of the free allocation of CO  emission rights (EU ETS) to airlines. 
2
•  The standards for charging infrastructure should be harmonised rapidly. 
21 
  
•  Impediments to smooth cross-border rail travel should also be eliminated further. 
Measures must be taken across Europe to strengthen rail travel as the environmentally 
friendly mobility backbone. 
•  Attractive high-speed rail connections should be built between the capitals and major 
centres of the European Union in addition to expanding and securing regional rail 
connections.  
•  As a top priority, all Member States are urged to improve the framework for a modal 
shift in freight and passenger traffic from the road to the electrified rail. A Europe-wide 
framework should also be created (standardisation, vehicle offerings) to develop 
additional technological options for the decarbonisation of the remaining cross-border 
transit traffic on the road (alternative renewable fuels; electrification systems, fuel 
cells). 
 
•  A European hydrogen strategy and “gas package” 2020 
–  The  Commission  should  move  forward  with  the  development  of  an 
internationally based, European hydrogen strategy that also accounts for future 
global hydrogen trade. The origin should be stated for hydrogen imports, and the 
hydrogen should be produced entirely from renewable energy sources. The 
strategy  should  also  present  increased  financing  options  for  sustainable 
hydrogen. 
–  The Green Deal should also place a focus on renewable gases. The European 
Commission’s “gas package” should include a clear pathway for the blending of 
renewable gases, uniform standards, and a reliable origin certification system. 
The future role of grid operators should also be discussed. 
•  In this context, enabling grid operators to build and operate electrolysis systems 
should be considered if these contribute to maintaining a reliable, high-capacity 
grid. 
–  European requirements for the injection of a certain share of renewable gases 
into the gas grid and for a mandatory share of renewable gases in imports could 
also be evaluated. 
 
The framework for the effective pricing of CO  should be to promote competition. To this end, 
2
the following concrete action areas are being brought into the discussion: 
•  Further measures for more effective CO  pricing in air traffic and for creating a 
2
competition-neutral taxation situation in relation to other modes of transport. 
•  For the purposes of environmental economy, a CO  price with an adequate incentive 
2
and steering effect is indispensable if we are to achieve our long-term goal of zero net 
emissions in an economically efficient manner. The discussion could explore tax 
instruments as well as the expansion of the existing emissions trading system. 
22 
  
•  In line with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement, the principle of true-cost 
pricing and the “polluter pays” principle must be taken more into account in matters 
of EU foreign trade and customs policy. To avoid competition distortions while 
ensuring polluter-based CO  pricing for as many consumer goods and services as 
2
possible, the work on a WTO-compliant carbon border adjustments mechanism (CO  
2
border tax on products from energy-intensive sectors) should be moved forward 
rapidly. This revenue could be paid into the EU budget as own funds, as for the 
customs tariffs.  
•  In implementing the EU emissions trading system and incorporating non-ETS sectors 
in the ETS scheme, the certificate price will presumably increase, which will send a 
decarbonisation price signal. Comprehensive carbon leakage protection must still be 
ensured to prevent the relocation of technology leaders as we move towards climate-
friendly production. 
•  Auctioning certificates in the ETS generates income for the Member States that can 
be a key source of financing for climate action measures.  
 
In the context of the decisions and debates about the design and implementation of the EU’s 
multiannual  financial  framework  (MFF)  starting  in  2021,  Austria  supports  the  following 
focuses: 
•  A resolution to earmark at least 25% of the MFF spending for the attainment of the 
climate targets starting in 2021. At the national level, it should also be evaluated here 
how cost-effective contributions can be made to target attainment in the non-ETS 
sectors. 
•  A Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) that is oriented more strongly towards the 
European climate targets, in particular a stronger focus in the CAP on (i) a reduction of 
the nitrogen surpluses, (ii) a reduction of emissions from livestock farming, (iii) an 
increase in the energy efficiency of agriculture, (iv) the preservation of permanent 
pasture, (v) the preservation of humus in cultivated land, and (vi) the preservation and 
sustainable management of the forests. 
•  Expansion  of  the  financial  instruments  for  the  use  of  renewable  energy,  taking 
international projects into account. 
•  A stronger focus in the programme for rural development on cost-effective attainment 
of the climate targets. 
•  A stronger focus in EU cohesion policy on the switch to renewable energy sources, 
including the creation of a Just Transition Fund by reallocating existing cohesion funds. 
•  An  increased  focus  in  the  ‘Horizon  Europe’  research  framework  programme  on 
innovation in the field of low-emission and climate-change-resilient technologies. 
23 
  
•  The EU-wide expansion of the charging infrastructure for electromobility (including 
through the EFSI successor InvestEU). 
•  Promotion of the development of hydrogen-based fuel cell technology (e.g. through 
corresponding Horizon Europe and InvestEU funding windows).  
•  Promotion of the automation and networking of sustainable mobility through the 
Digital Europe programme.  
•  Introduction of a national contribution to the EU budget calculated from the non-
recycled plastic packaging waste generated in each Member State (“plastic funds”) as 
indicated by statistical data to create an incentive for the Member States to reduce the 
generation of non-recycled plastic. 
•  Allocation of 15% of the funds of the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) that are 
earmarked for the energy segment to cross-border renewable energy projects. 
 
2.1.4  Adaptation policy and measures 
2.1.4.1  Effects of climate change in Austria 
According to the Austrian climate change status report (AAR 2014), the country has seen an 
increase in the annual average temperature of around 2°C since 1880. This increase is markedly 
higher than the global temperature increase of 0.9°C (IPCC 2013). Climate change is having 
very clear impacts in Austria: an increase in the number of heat waves, a decrease in the 
number of days with sub-zero temperatures, rapid glacial melting, permafrost thawing, the 
increased  frequency  of  heavy  precipitation  events,  longer  vegetation  periods,  the 
establishment of new pathogens, increased bark beetle infestation, changing water supply in 
agriculture, lower crop yields, etc. Climate change is having a serious impact on nearly every 
area of life. 
Even if the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the average global temperature increase to well 
below 2°C compared with pre-industrial levels is met, it will only be possible to partially prevent 
the consequences of climate change. A further temperature increase through to the middle of 
the century is unavoidable because of the inertia of the climate system and the persistence of 
greenhouse gases. The economic effects of extreme weather events in Austria are serious and 
have increased over the past three decades.  
The Paris Agreement places equal focus on adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. 
Austria has been following this two-pronged approach in its climate policy for a number of 
years and was one of the first EU countries to link a strategic concept for adapting to climate 
change  with  a  comprehensive  action  plan  for  the  implementation  of  concrete 
24 
  
recommendations (Austrian Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change, 2012; expanded in 
2017).  
This means that adapting to climate change is to complement the reduction of greenhouse 
gases, and attempts to influence the overall system from a different vector. It is based on the 
evidence-based fact that climate change will continue due to the inertia of the climate system 
even if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced substantially. This means that the challenges 
associated with adaptation to climate change will increase in the coming decades, regardless 
of the efforts undertaken and successes achieved on mitigation of climate change. Adaptation 
to and mitigation of climate change are thus two sides of one coin and are directly related. The 
more successful we are in reducing worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, the less we will need 
to adapt to climate change. The less effective the global climate mitigation efforts are, the 
more we will have to invest in adapting to climate change. But adapting to climate change has 
intrinsic limits, and cannot replace climate mitigation. 
Adaptation - as the term is used in the Austrian strategy - refers to all efforts that contribute to 
allowing the environment and society to effectively prepare for the new conditions resulting 
from climate change. Good adaptation practice as a separate term also reflects the need to 
orient the practices towards the principles of sustainability. This must be observed closely as a 
kind of quality assurance in the planning and implementation of recommended actions. 
Measures that are promising only in the short term and/or from a purely sectoral perspective 
but  that  are  counterproductive  from  a  different  perspective  must  be  classified  as 
maladaptation. The Austrian strategy for adaptation to climate change is based on the criteria 
of sustainable development and clearly rejects maladaptation.  
It must be ensured that the measures taken to adapt to climate change and to protect the 
climate do not counteract each other, but that they support each other and generate synergies 
where possible. 
The high complexity of the issue is a particular challenge and results in part from the different 
levels at which decisions are made and from the interactions between different areas and 
aspects. Adaptation to climate change is a complex, overarching issue that affects a large 
number of action areas and different levels of policy. This issue must be considered across all 
sectors, and adaptations must be made in various areas of public administration. The possible 
consequences of climate change must in any case be taken into consideration in a systematic 
manner in all relevant planning and decision-making processes from the national to the local 
level. 
2.1.4.2  Austria’s strategy for adapting to climate change 
The Austrian Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change was adopted by the Council of 
Ministers in October 2012 and acknowledged by the Provincial Governors’ Conference in May 
25 
  
2013. A revised and expanded version was then approved by the federal and provincial 
governments in 2017. The primary goal of this strategy is to avoid adverse effects from climate 
change on the environment, society, and economy and to seize the resulting opportunities. 
The document is broken down into a strategic section (context) and an action plan with 
concrete recommendations for action (over 130) in 14 different fields of activity.  
As the nationwide orientation framework, the strategy contributes to facilitating networking 
and strong partnerships between the various involved parties, and to the leveraging of 
potential  synergies  through  cooperation  arrangements.  Its  mission  is  to  provide 
recommendations for action for the various areas and to provide points of reference for all 
parties involved in implementation. In line with the precautionary principle, it is designed to 
provide a basis for making decisions in due consideration of future climate effects and to 
promote successful implementation. A proactive approach is crucial because the ability to 
successfully adapt decreases and the associated costs rise as climate change progresses.   The 
Austrian adaptation strategy is rooted in a context of sustainable development that seeks to 
ensure viable – in other words economically strong, socially just, and ecologically sound – 
conditions in the future. 
Adaptation to climate change is a continuous process that requires the recurring evaluation of 
the significant impacts of climate change and the effectiveness of the chosen measures. For 
this reason, regular progress reports depicting the state of implementation in the various fields 
of activity are planned. The first progress report on the state of adaptation in Austria was 
adopted by the Council of Ministers in 2015 and was also acknowledged by the Provincial 
Governors’ Conference. A second progress report is planned for the end of 2020. 
The KLAR! funding programme shows ways in which the local effects of climate change can be 
handled and the resulting economic costs mitigated through regional measures. Together with 
the BMNT, the Climate and Energy Fund launched this pioneering climate change adaptation 
programme in 2016 on the basis of scientific findings in order to give regions the ability to 
minimise the adverse impacts of climate change and to seize new opportunities based on the 
current state of knowledge. The programme has been coordinated with the federal strategy 
and the provincial strategies and is the only nationwide programme to also address the 
regional level. A total of 362 towns are currently participating in the KLAR! programme, 
covering around 10% of the Austrian population. 
The Austrian Climate Research Programme (ACRP) provides the scientific basis for many 
implementation measures in Austria and presents recommendations for action for decision 
makers and the public administration in adapting to climate change. The objective of the 
programme is to research the effects of climate change and to create a scientific basis for 
forward-looking decision making in the areas of public policy, the economy, and society. This 
makes the ACRP an important instrument for addressing the urgent questions that arise in 
26 
  
dealing with climate change in a scientific manner and for making new findings and solution 
approaches available for policymaking and practical implementation. 
The only way to avoid damage and to profit from opportunities for numerous sectors of the 
economy  is  through  the  forward-looking  planning  and  implementation  of  adaptation 
measures. As the results of the COIN project on the costs of a lack of action in Austria show, 
the failure to implement adaptation measures will be associated with considerable costs 
through to 2050. This underscores the urgency of placing a greater focus on adapting to 
climate change and assigning it a higher priority on the political agenda. 
2.2  Renewable energy 
2.2.1  Introduction  
The European energy system has undergone major changes since its liberalisation, especially 
in the electricity market. There is a powerful shift towards a decentralised, renewable energy 
supply  with  considerably  more  volatile  generation  characteristics  in  an  increasingly 
competitive and integrated market environment. 
While markets and competition have been successfully driven forward in the past, we now 
need to make the energy sector considerably more environmentally friendly over the medium 
term and decarbonise it by 2050. This poses complex challenges that call for a great need for 
action to more closely coordinate energy- and climate-policy goals. 
The share of renewable electricity in the European Union has already increased considerably. 
In 2017 about 85% of the newly installed electricity generation capacity used renewable 
technologies, and a good third of the electricity demand was covered by renewable sources.  
The decarbonisation of the energy sector is a key goal of the European Energy Union. This 
means making renewable energy sources an essential part of the market by further expanding 
their use. There is no doubt that a well-functioning and integrated energy market is key for 
enabling  the  generation  of  large  quantities  of  electricity  from  renewable  sources  and 
integrating them into the grid in a cost-efficient manner – while maintaining competitiveness, 
affordability for businesses and households, and the security of the energy supply. 
27 
  
2.2.2  Target vision 
The decarbonisation of the Austrian energy system requires a large number of coordinated 
measures  and  activities.  The  country  needs  a  balanced,  sustainable  energy  mix  that 
consistently promotes the expansion of local renewable energy resources and that  uses 
bridging technologies to ensure a security of supply on the decarbonisation path. This implies 
a rapid exit from coal, the replacement of all fossil oil heating systems and a switch to zero- 
and low-emission vehicles.  
As we become less dependent on fossil energy imports, Austria will massively increase its own 
supply of local energy while the costs and risks associated with the energy supply and mobility 
will decrease thanks to the switch to efficient technologies. 
Nuclear power is not an answer to climate change – Austria consistently takes this position at 
all levels and will continue to advocate that no funding be provided for nuclear power.  
Sector coupling is a core element of the future energy system. This means that previously 
separate  systems  (electricity,  heat,  mobility,  industry)  will  be  linked.  With  the  help  of 
renewable energy sources that above all deliver electricity, sector coupling will allow all sectors 
of the economy to be decarbonised. The use of energy-efficient technologies such as heat 
pump heating systems and electric vehicles will also allow considerable reductions in energy 
consumption. 
Efforts and innovation are required at all levels of the value chain to integrate renewable 
energy sources: in the legal framework, in technology development, in vocational training and 
awareness-raising, and for viable, market-based business models. At the same time, existing 
barriers must be removed and investments in generation, transport lines, load management, 
and storage must be facilitated and – if needed- promoted. 
The electricity market of the coming years will be characterized by a more variable and 
decentralised  generation,  increased  integration,  and  new  technological  possibilities  for 
consumers to lower their energy costs and to actively participate in the energy market by 
means of load management, on-site consumption and storage of electricity.  
A key question in the area of conflict between centralised and decentralised infrastructure is 
how security of supply can be ensured as economically as possible. In the light of increasing 
digitalisation, networking, market integration, and technological innovation, stronger regional 
value creation should be promoted in the energy sector and all flexibility potentials on the 
supply and demand side should be exploited. 
28 
  
The transformation of the energy system towards more decentralised generation (wind power, 
photovoltaics, biomass, etc.) can contribute to the increased importance of lower-voltage 
regional networks in 2050. Locally generated energy (e.g. from a wind farm) will be supplied to 
end users in the region, which will strengthen the regional value chain in the energy system 
and improve security of supply.  
This also affects the relationship between the transport and storage of energy. Expanding 
storage capacities can also contribute to supplying end users with more regionally generated 
energy. 
The issue of cost fairness in the construction and operation of infrastructure is also relevant, 
especially in terms of transit lines. For example, should increasing volumes of renewable 
electricity flow from the north to the south of Europe, new rules for the fair coverage of the 
associated infrastructure costs must be developed. Anyone who needs and uses infrastructure 
should also pay for it – unjustified costs for national electricity consumers must be avoided.   
The decarbonisation of the energy system will bring new opportunities for market participants, 
but also major challenges. At the same time, technological innovations create new forms of 
consumer participation and cross-border collaboration. 
The  transformation  of  the  energy  system  is  also  being  moved  forward  through  the 
decarbonisation of the gas grid by increasingly substituting natural gas with renewable gases. 
Hydrogen is a key technology in sector coupling, as are hydrogen-based synthetic gases and 
methane from biogenic sources. National production potential must be sustainably increased, 
and the production fed into the local grid. National gas consumption should be CO neutral in 
2 
net terms by 2050 while still accounting for Austria’s role as a gas hub in a tightly integrated 
European internal market. Austrian industry must be decarbonised while maintaining a level 
playing field.  
2.2.3  Current situation in Austria 
Natural gas represents around 22% of gross domestic energy consumption, and petroleum 
37%. Austria has one oil refinery (Schwechat), two petroleum pipelines (the trans-Alpine oil 
line/TAL and the Adriatic-Vienna pipeline/AVP), one product line from Schwechat to St. 
Valentin, and 13 crude oil and product storage facilities with a capacity of over 1,000 m³ each.  
Natural gas storage facilities with a total capacity of 8.2 billion m³ are located in the border 
region between Upper Austria and Salzburg and in Lower Austria as well as long-distance and 
distribution grid gas lines with a total length of over 46,000 km. 
29 
  
The Austrian electricity grid has a total length of over 73,000 km of overhead lines and around 
186,500 km of underground lines.  
In line with the international and European framework, the Austrian climate and energy 
strategy #mission2030 was adopted in May 2018. It defines the climate and energy policy 
framework through to 2030 that aims to make our economy and energy system fit for the 
major challenges of climate change for the long term. Quantitative targets for 2030 form the 
core elements of this strategy and include: 
•  an increase in the share of renewable energy to 46–50% (level in 2017: 32.6%), 
•  a further 25–30% improvement compared to the primary energy intensity in 2015, and 
•  the production of enough electricity to cover 100% of the total electricity use (national 
balance, net) from renewable sources by 2030. 
Exceptions from the 100% target were defined in that control and balancing energy for 
stabilising the grid and internal electricity generation from fossil fuels for tangible goods 
production will not be included in achieving the target. These two exceptions are expected to 
account for around 6 TWh in 2030.  
The net addition of 22 to 27 TWh was estimated in consultation with experts and in accordance 
with the range of current national scenarios to ensure that the target will be reached in 2030. 
“Net” means that existing facilities that are taken offline before 2030 must also be replaced. 
The estimates for the exceptions and for gross domestic power use in 2030 were made by the 
Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism in consultation with experts (Austrian Energy 
Agency, E-Control, Federal Environment Agency) in line with the targets of the Austrian 
climate and energy strategy #mission2030. 
It is clear that all renewable energy technologies (those requiring raw materials such as 
bioenergy and those requiring no input materials such as solar and wind energy) will be needed 
to meet this ambitious target. The planned Renewable Energy Expansion Act (EAG) is to 
create the long-term framework and reliable planning certainty for future-proof, sustainable 
investments in renewable energy production. 
2.2.4  Fields of action 
  The trend towards renewable energy will continue to accelerate because this is the only 
way to meet the requirements of the Paris Agreement. Current decarbonisation scenarios 
30 
  
clearly show that electricity demand will increase rapidly in relative and absolute terms by 
2050 despite decreasing end energy consumption. In the context of the 100% renewable 
energy target for 2030 (national, net), it must be evaluated in detail how the achievement 
of this goal can also be secured in the years up to 2050. 
  The amendment of the Green Electricity Act and its replacement with the Renewable 
Energy Expansion Act will lead to a substantial increase in the generation of electricity from 
renewable sources.  
  The greater variability and decentralisation of renewable electricity generation will require 
more flexible market rules and regulations for grid operation.  
  The creation of  short-term markets should increase liquidity and make it easier for 
operators of volatile, renewable generation capacities to market their electricity under fair 
conditions and open up new business opportunities. 
  For  an  efficient  management  of  necessary  investments,  prices  must  signal  where 
electricity is needed most urgently. Effective price signals should also activate existing 
flexibility potential on the demand side and ensure appropriate remuneration for flexible 
resources including load management and storage as well as the efficient use of existing 
generation facilities. The affordability of renewable electricity must also be kept in mind, 
especially for energy-intensive industry and low-income households.    
  A level playing field and incentives for energy storage, participation in load management, 
and improving energy efficiency must also be created for all market participants.  
  Innovative devices, technologies, and systems will make it possible to tap energy savings 
potential, to quickly react to price signals, and to thus contribute to the flexibility of the 
electricity grid.  
  Digitalisation and Internet-based solutions will offer the ability to generate and store 
electricity  and  to  participate  in  the  electricity  markets  through  load  management 
solutions. Energy supply companies will turn into energy services providers. 
  If the energy system becomes increasingly electrified and decentralised, this will require a 
suitable expansion of the grid (integrated Austrian grid infrastructure plan). 
  Significantly reduced costs, especially for photovoltaic and storage systems, will enable 
more and more citizens to actively participate in the energy system by investing in 
renewable energy facilities as energy consumers and producers.  
  Price incentives for the reduction or timing of energy demand will be set. 
  New  energy  supply  concepts  (including  at  household  level,  decentralised  groups  of 
apartment  buildings,  and  energy  services  providers)  will  facilitate  the  interplay  of 
centralised and decentralised supply. 
  An increasing share of photovoltaic systems with storage facilities (2050: 100% of the 
newly installed systems are to include storage). 
31 
  
  New electricity storage technologies will be developed: chemical short-term storage, 
power-to-gas is sensible for seasonal storage because the existing natural gas grid can be 
used. This is intended to compensate for the lack of sunshine in winter.  
  Large electrolysis systems for converting electricity into hydrogen and synthetic gas. 
  Off-grid systems with small storage units and grids with large storage capacities will 
provide for robust and efficient energy and storage infrastructure (for the optimal use of 
renewable energy sources) in a functioning European electricity market. 
  Grid stability will be ensured through  a functioning European market for which the 
corresponding  infrastructure  is  provided.  Demand-side  management  (DSM)  and 
electrolysis systems will contribute to grid stability. 
  Ambient and waste heat will be incorporated.  
  Seasonal electricity and heat storage will help prevent supply bottlenecks during the 
winter. Heat and electricity generation from renewable sources will be increased. 
  Sustainable  forest  management  including  adapting  the  forest  to  climate  change  to 
increase  the  resilience  and  stability  of  the  forest  stock  so  that  productivity  can  be 
maintained and increased in the future.  
  The sustainable usable reserves of domestic bioenergy will be successively tapped. 
  The  generation  and  distribution  of  district  heating  will  become  highly  efficient  and 
renewable. 
  Refinery capacities will change based on the processed inputs (innovative refurbishment). 
The national consumption of fossil fuels and heating oil will fall to virtually zero by 2050 
while the use of hydrogen and synthetic fuels will increase massively. Existing refinery 
capacities will be converted to the use and production of non-fossil fuels (hydrogen, 
renewable gas). 
  An international hydrogen market will allow substantial imports of hydrogen and synthetic 
fuels. The aim should be that the production of these energy sources abroad should be 
based on renewable energy sources to the greatest degree possible. “Blue” hydrogen will 
play a role as a bridging technology for a certain time, and “green” hydrogen will be used 
over the medium and long term.  
  Conversion of the compressor stations to electric drives. 
  Incentive effects to promote the local feed of renewable gases into the domestic gas grid. 
  National gas consumption should be CO neutral in net terms by 2050 while still accounting 
2 
for Austria’s role as a gas hub in a tightly integrated European internal market. 
  The use of geothermal energy can be a valuable expansion of the Austrian energy mix 
because it is not only CO neutral, but also has a base load capacity. This means that many 
2 
problems of volatile energy sources do not apply to geothermal power to the same degree. 
Space requirements, storage, and availability are less problematic here than with other 
32 
  
forms of alternative energy. Energy collected through geothermal probes can be provided 
to all sectors and throughout the country. 
2.3  Energy efficiency 
2.3.1  Introduction 
Energy efficiency is to help provide products and services, prosperity, and convenience to the 
population while using as little energy as possible. This is not aimed at reducing economic 
output or lowering the level of prosperity or convenience. On the contrary, economic and 
prosperity  growth  are  to  be  made  possible  by  using  the  technical,  economic,  social, 
organisational, and institutional possibilities to achieve this growth with as little energy input 
as possible. 
Energy efficiency measures are also among the least economically costly means of avoiding 
greenhouse gas emissions and are the top priority for the Energy Union and Austria. Medium- 
and long-term visions for a decarbonised future are to be drafted in an integrated strategy 
encompassing the areas of renewable energy, energy generation, energy efficiency, and 
energy savings in close alignment with measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions. 
In terms of efficiency, the most sustainable option is to use less energy. With this in mind, the 
establishment of a sustainable energy system is one of the central challenges of the coming 
years. 
The Austrian climate and energy strategy (#mission2030) is built on the triad of supply 
security, competitiveness, and ecological sustainability for the benefit of the European Energy 
Union. Central ecological objectives for 2030 have been defined in the areas of greenhouse gas 
emissions, renewable energy, and energy efficiency and are to be pursued by means of 
effective measures. 
As growth is also to be facilitated in future, Austria has set the goal of improving its primary 
energy intensity by 25–30% compared with 2015. If a primary energy demand of 1,200 PJ is 
exceeded by 2030, the energy needs beyond this limit are to be covered by energy from 
renewable sources. 
The energy efficiency developments in the European Union also require a redefinition of the 
national framework for the period to 2030. The goal of this is to achieve the desired energy 
efficiency increase more effectively and less bureaucratic, in line with the achievement of the 
climate and energy targets for 2030 and the goals of the Paris Agreement so as to bring energy 
consumption onto the desired pathway. 
33 
  
2.3.2  Challenges 
Despite the advantages provided by energy efficiency measures, it must not be forgotten that 
they often also involve costs. For companies in particular, it is not only the cost-benefit ratio of 
efficiency measures over the life cycle that is relevant, but also the amortisation period. Long-
term measures that do not pay off for seven, ten, or more years are often not realizable for 
companies. There is also a certain lack of financing options for companies and households as 
banks and investors still have little ability to assess the financing of efficiency measures – 
especially where it is difficult to evaluate the risk of technically complex measures that 
generate no direct returns but simply cost savings. 
Rebound effects – two steps forward, one step back! 
Energy efficiency cuts costs. These cost savings mean that the energy consumer has more 
income to spend on products, travel, and energy. Efficiency measures can also suggest that 
not a whole lot of energy is being used anyway. This can in turn lead to changed consumption 
patterns and increased energy use. In this way, the savings from energy efficiency measures 
are partially offset by higher energy consumption. 
2.4  Information about specific sectors 
2.4.1  Energy storage systems 
2.4.1.1  Introduction  
The  growing  share  of  renewable  energy  and  the  increasing  decentralisation  of  energy 
generation mean that we must adapt our energy system. In addition to a greater number of 
local generation facilities such as photovoltaic, wind, and biomass systems, new consumers 
(such as electric vehicles and heat pumps) and storage facilities must also be integrated into 
the energy system. 
The structural change in the energy supply system will only be successful if the various 
elements and sectors of the system are coordinated optimally. Sector coupling, in other words 
the linking of electricity, heat, and mobility, is the central concept for optimally using and 
integrating renewable energy. The energy system of the future requires smart components 
that communicate with each other to allow for a secure, stable, and sustainable energy supply. 
Storage potential seems to be limited at present. Storage for hydropower (pump storage), 
batteries, and gas storage (with hydrogen, for example) will be used, among other options, and 
34 
  
(new) forms of storage will be successively expanded through increasing research activities 
until 2050. 
Hydropower recently covered around 57% of domestic electricity generation (depending on 
fluctuating generation conditions) according to the most recent statistics, making it the most 
important energy source in this segment. In 2017, gross electricity generation from the more 
than 100 storage power plants amounted to 33.7 PJ, which was 13.9% of the total gross 
electricity generation of 242.8 PJ. By contrast, the generation value of the approximately 3,000 
run-of-river power plants (mainly small hydropower plants) was 104.4 PJ or 43%. A further 
expansion of so-called pump storage facilities will also depend on environmental protection 
issues (environmental impact assessment). 
  Mined caverns as pump storage facilities: 
Underground pump storage power plants that are located in cavities created by mining 
could be used as possible energy storage in future. In technical terms, this could be realised 
through a closed system of pump and pressure lines and watertight storage, using a 
substantial elevation difference between two cavities. Existing or newly mined cavities and 
shafts could be used for this. The mode of operation corresponds to that of a conventional 
pump storage power plant, but this technology could provide an extremely gentle surface 
utilization. These storages enable short-term bridging of bottlenecks in the daily or weekly 
rhythm. 
The current consumption of natural gas in Austria is around 8 billion Nm3.  A gas storage 
capacity of around 2.5 to 3.0 billion Nm3 with a corresponding withdrawal capacity is required 
to ensure security of supply with natural gas. Based on this and considering the objective of 
reducing gas consumption by a least 40% by 2050, a hydrogen storage capacity of around 3.0 
to 3.5 billion Nm3 with corresponding withdrawal capacity should be available by 2050. 
The world’s first high pressure and high temperature storage facility went into operation in 
Simmering in the southeast of Vienna in 2013. The integration of the new storage facility into 
the Viennese district heating system allowed energy generation and consumption to be 
decoupled. The storage of excess heat (up to 980 MWh) from adjacent power generation 
systems reduces the use of the peak load furnaces and the resulting CO  emissions during 
2
periods of high heat demand. 
Europe is combining its efforts to succeed on the world market for energy technologies. The 
Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) forms the framework, especially for the exchange 
of information on research and development and the implementation of cost-efficient, low-
emission, sustainable, and safe energy technologies. A key focus is being placed on increasing 
Europe’s  competitiveness  in  the  areas  of  batteries  (source:  SET  Plan  action  7 
https://setis.ec.europa.eu/implementing-integrated-set-plan/batteries-e-mobility-and-
stationary-storage-ongoing-work). Because batteries are a key technology for e-mobility and 
stationary storage, among other things. To be competitive in the global battery sector, 
35 
  
European industry must be skilled in the development, production, application, and recycling 
of modern batteries. For this reason, these aspects were identified as focus points for future 
action in the SET Plan. 
2.4.1.2  Target vision (using the potential of underground pore storage) 
The use of natural geological zones can make an important contribution to ensuring a secure 
energy supply in Austria and Europe. These formations are an integral part of Austria’s energy 
infrastructure, are currently used to store energy in the form of natural gas, and are located at 
a depth of around 500 to 2,300 m in exhausted natural gas reservoirs. These storage facilities 
have proven their ability to contain gas over millions of years and have been extensively 
investigated over the course of the extraction of their natural gas. Expertise gained over many 
years of production ensure safe storage operations.  
2.4.1.3  Current situation in Austria 
The geological structures that are currently used in Austria are hydrocarbon reservoirs, which 
have a substantially higher storage capacity than deep saline aquifers. The aquifers that are 
not yet used for storage offer considerable pore storage potential for different applications. 
The exit from fossil fuels will change the use of these geological structures. In the context of 
sector  coupling,  underground  pore  storage  can  make  important  contributions  to  the 
decarbonisation of Austria’s energy supply in different ways. These are: 
2.4.1.4  Fields of action 
  Underground pore storage for energy storage  
In future, other media besides natural gas can be injected into the geological formations to 
contribute to the storage of energy generated from volatile sources. This is already 
happening  today,  among  other  things,  through  “Power-to-Gas  technology  for  the 
production of hydrogen from electricity generated by electrolysis e.g. from solar or wind 
energy, which is then being injected into suitable formations within the framework of pilot 
projects. 
The storage of compressed air produced using renewable energy sources and the storage 
of media heated using renewable energy can also be injected into these geological 
structures.  
Synthetic gas, compressed air, or a heated media could be injected into natural geological 
formations in the summer months so that the increased, non-continuous demand in winter 
(consumption peaks at different times of the day) can be covered from the reservoirs. 
 
36 
  
a) Underground pore storage and CCU  
Carbon dioxide capture and utilisation (CCU) technology is designed to capture CO  from 
2
industrial processes (point sources) and to feed it into a technical application. The CCU 
process can make a contribution to the circular economy. A further application of this is the 
generation of synthetic methane (natural gas), i.e. within the pore structures.  
To do this, the captured CO  is injected into a geological structure together with green 
2
hydrogen and then converted into synthetic methane by the bacteria residing there. This 
gas offers all the technical advantages of natural gas but is CO  neutral and could be used 
2
for special applications that are difficult to electrify. This could include air traffic. 
In addition to renewable methane, which is the most mature technology at present, there 
are other concepts for the use of the captured CO  that have the potential to contribute to 
2
mitigation of climate change. One of these processes is the so-called “carbonation”, where 
CO  is bound in the form of carbonates and could be stored for geological time periods or 
2
used as a construction material. 
Another  promising  approach  is  the  cultivation  of  microalgae  that  use  CO   for  their 
2
photosynthesis. This means that sunlight and CO  are turned into biomass for further 
2
utilisation.  
b) Underground pore storage and CCS 
Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology is designed to capture CO  from 
2
industrial processes (point sources) and permanently prevent it from being released into 
the  atmosphere.  Such  permanent  carbon  dioxide  storage  is  a  competitive  use  that 
prevents the alternate use of underground structures. CCS projects are only viable when 
long-term safety and environmental protection can be guaranteed. 
There are currently no CCS projects in Austria as a moratorium on this technology is in force 
under the “Federal Act on the Prohibition of the Geological Storage of Carbon Dioxide”. 
This Act will be re-evaluated every five years, taking the experiences gained around the 
world  into  account.  The  current  evaluation  report  states  that  further  research  and 
development work is needed for such projects, with a focus on the national geological 
conditions and the effects on the environment. 
The possibility of new research findings by 2050 should not be ruled out. A possible 
contribution of CCS technology to climate mitigation should be approached with a certain 
openness, as it permanently removes CO  from the carbon cycle. This is an interesting 
2
advantage that CCS technology has over CCU technology.  
 
 
37 
  
c) Making approval processes more efficient 
Many of the measures are linked to investment projects for which permits must be obtained. 
The approval processes are to be designed efficiently while maintaining environmental and 
participation standards. The actual duration of the process is needs to be aligned with the legal 
requirements. In any case, the public’s interest in climate action and security of supply must be 
given high priority. 
2.4.2  Industry 
2.4.2.1  Introduction and target vision 
The goal is to create a competitive, modern, and climate-neutral economy in Austria. The 
various sectors of the economy will undergo substantial changes to achieve this. Policy makers 
will  create  a  framework  that  enables  industrial  sectors  to  transition  to  climate-friendly 
technologies at their Austrian sites. In doing so, the policy makers will not expose industry to 
excessive CO  costs that would impair its competitiveness.  
2
The top priority for European policy is to establish a global CO  price for key sectors to 
2
effectively combat the problem of relocation.  
Austrian  industry  is  a  driver  of  innovation  and a  front  runner  in  key  technologies.  The 
development  and  implementation  of  innovative  and  sustainable  energy  technologies 
contributes to stimulating economic growth and industrial development while also furthering 
decarbonisation.  Policymakers  rely  on  cooperation  and  partnerships  with  the  business 
community.  The  prerequisite  of  major  investments  for  the  technology  transition  is  the 
predictability of framework conditions over the entire amortisation period. 
The goal is clean growth, in other words decarbonisation, driven by sustainable economic 
expansion and a higher degree of technological innovation. This will create the necessary 
conditions for the domestic economy to secure Austria as an attractive industrial location even 
in a decarbonised environment. Particularly energy-intensive sectors often operate in a highly 
competitive global market, and suitable framework conditions are to be created so they can 
continue to succeed in the future (for as long as there is a cost disparity between the EU and 
third countries).  
In a first wave, coal and other particularly harmful fossil fuels will likely be replaced, and 
industrial processes will then be powered by electricity and green gas/hydrogen in a second 
wave, for which research will be conducted on an ongoing basis. 
Renewable hydrogen will play a central role in the decarbonisation of industry, especially in 
energy-intensive sectors. Hydrogen is used not only as a raw material in industrial processes, 
38 
  
but can also replace natural gas as a source of energy if the production process cannot be 
electrified.  
Here, the greatest CO  reduction potential can be realised by substituting the use of fossil-fuel 
2
based hydrogen and by developing new hydrogen applications and process modifications, 
especially for high-temperature operations, combined with a corresponding upscaling and 
changed energy and raw materials management.  
Industry is already testing possibilities for substantially reducing CO  emissions by using 
2
renewable hydrogen. Renewable hydrogen is expected to play an especially important role in 
the long-term decarbonisation of the steel industry.  
The EU’s flagship project H2FUTURE for steel production at voestalpine in Linz is the largest 
pilot hydrogen system of its kind in the world with a connected load of 6 MW. This project is 
allowing research into the potential for the use of renewable hydrogen for steel production and 
is laying the groundwork for further expansion to an industrial scale. 
However,  the  cost-efficient  supply  of  all  domestic  industries  with  renewable  hydrogen 
produced using green electricity from Austria at competitive prices is not certain at this time. 
It will be necessary to cover part of the future hydrogen needs for industry, mobility, and other 
sectors via imports over the long term. This means that the hydrogen economy must be 
promoted and structured not only at a national level, but at the European and global level to 
ensure that future industrial hydrogen applications are internationally competitive. Flourishing 
international trade will ensure the supply of hydrogen as a fuel for Austrian industry beyond 
the national production capacity by 2050, which will require energy partnerships with other 
(neighbouring) economic areas. 
In  addition  to  these  key  challenges,  the  switch  to  hydrogen  also  entails  technological 
challenges that are currently impeding the broader use of hydrogen for industrial applications. 
The switch to hydrogen also creates new requirements for process safety that must be 
addressed.  Technological  feasibility  and  sufficient  financial  incentives  for  breakthrough 
technologies are prerequisites for solving the current bottlenecks in the renewable energy 
supply.  
Target visions from the industrial transition scenario: 
  The objectives of the circular economy will be reached. The consumption of resources will 
be taken into account in the (ecological) balance to allow the recycling of precious metals 
and rare-earth metals in an economical manner.  
  Materials will be chosen based on recyclability. There are only few composite materials 
that cannot be separated.  
39 
  
  The changed use of long-lasting, high-quality products (sharing economy, leasing, re-use, 
upgrading, recycling) and the resulting changes in the production processes will lead to the 
highly efficient use of the required energy and resources (improved recycling). 
  Planned obsolescence will be avoided through suitable measures.  
  Falling ancillary wage costs and rising transport, energy, and material costs will lead to 
more products being repaired instead of replaced.  
  Products will no longer be designed to deliver 100% optimum performance but to achieve 
a compromise between performance and re-use. Modular designs will permit upgrades and 
component replacement, meaning that only defective or non-functional components will 
be replaced. 
  This will increase the value and life of the products.  
  Technological advances and technical revolutions will lead to lower energy input per 
produced unit. 
  The EU Ecodesign legislation will address not only energy, but also sparing resource use, 
long life, repairability, and guaranteed warranties. 
  Important  criteria  for  electrical  devices  will  be  both  low  energy  consumption  and 
protection of the data they contain against external attacks. 
  CO  labelling will be introduced for consumer goods (such as food) at least EU-wide. A good 
2
competitive framework and strong internal market will be created in the EU for the 
development of new technologies that will play a central role in decarbonisation and the 
energy transformation.  
  Fertiliser use and production will be reduced by avoiding food waste. The lower volume of 
waste will also have effects on the food industry. 
2.4.2.2  Current situation in Austria  
The industrial output ratio in Austria in 2018 was 18.9% measured by the share of the 
manufacturing and processing sectors in total gross value added. 
Based on the entire secondary sector (mining, goods manufacture, energy and water supply, 
construction),  industry  contributed  25.75%  of  nominal  GDP  in  2018,  and  mining  and 
manufacturing of goods alone contributed 17.24%. 
 
The manufacturing sector´s share accounted for 29.1% of final energy use in 2018. The 
structure of the final energy use in the manufacturing sector (2017) according to energy 
sources showed the following picture: 
  Gas: 33.5% 
  Electricity: 31.6% 
  Biogenic energy: 16.8% 
  Petroleum products: 5.7% 
  Coal: 5.2% 
40 
  
  Waste incineration: 3.7%   
  District heating: 3.5% 
  Ambient heat: 0.1% 
 
Final energy use in manufacturing by sector (2017):                  Share of fossil fuels by sector: 
Paper/printing:     22.5%        31% 
Chemicals/petrochemicals:   13.4%        46% 
Iron and steel:      11.1%        74% 
Stone, soil, glass:     10.9%        50% 
Mechanical engineering:   8.9%        42% 
Food and beverages:     8.6%        56% 
Wood processing:     7.9%        11% 
Construction:      5.2%        74% 
Non-ferrous metals:     2.8%        56% 
Mining:       2.3%        35% 
Vehicles:       2.1%        33% 
Textiles/leather:     1.0%        55% 
Other:        3.4%        21% 
Note: Fossil fuels consist of coal, petroleum products, and natural gas 
Does not include electricity and district heating produced with fossil fuels 
The share of coal in the final energy use of manufacturing is low at 5.2%. Of these 17.5 PJ in 
total, 10.7 PJ are used for iron and steel production, 3.2 PJ for paper/printing, 2.2 PJ for 
stone/soil/glass, and 1.1 PJ for chemicals/petrochemicals.  
Marginal quantities are used in the sectors of non-ferrous metals, food and beverages, and 
mining (0.3 PJ in total). 
The consumption of coal in the energy sector itself (coking plants, blast furnaces, power plants) 
is significantly more substantial at around 70 PJ. 
2.4.2.2.1 The role of hydrogen 
Hydrogen is currently produced primarily from natural gas by means of steam reforming and 
is used as an input for a wide range of processes in the chemical industry. The greatest national 
potential for the use of hydrogen has been identified in the steel, chemicals (ammonia and 
methanol production), mineral oil, and brick industries. Especially high-temperature processes 
will still depend on gaseous, molecular fuels for which there are not yet any alternatives in 
many areas. 
41 
  
2.4.2.3  Fields of action 
  Further development of EU emissions trading and the associated reduction in the 
supply of certificates combined with the implementation of effective carbon leakage 
protection for companies, for example through continued free allocations  
  Examination  of further  steps  to  ensure  location  security  and  competitiveness  of 
industry  in  Austria  and  Europe,  e.g.  by  earmarking  the  auction  proceeds  for 
investments in technology transformation and carbon border adjustment measures to 
prevent climate dumping. 
  Preserving and expanding the competitiveness of domestic industry through research 
and the use of innovative technologies. 
  Promotion  of  carbon  capture  and  utilisation  (CCU)  in  industry  as  this  bridging 
technology will make an important contribution to the decarbonisation of industry, 
especially in the transitional phase. 
  Pan-European value chains, especially in the hydrogen segment, will be set up with 
Austria playing a central role and will contribute to the competitiveness of Austria as a 
place to do business. 
  Technological feasibility and sufficient incentives for breakthrough technologies are 
prerequisites for solving the current bottlenecks in the renewable energy supply.  
  Suitable investment promotion for hydrogen-based decarbonisation technologies, 
renewable hydrogen production technologies, and infrastructure innovations to secure 
the power supply (e.g. IPCEI hydrogen).  
  Permanent availability of a sufficient quantity of renewable electricity at competitive 
costs and ensuring the comprehensive international competitiveness of domestic 
industry. 
  In order to counteract global locational disadvantages, it is crucial to push Austria's 
initiatives at European and international level for a competitive hydrogen application, 
especially for initiatives after 2030. 
  The topic of hydrogen management must be promoted beyond national strategies at 
the European and then global level to ensure the competitiveness of future industrial 
hydrogen applications. 
2.4.2.4  Bio-economy 
Bio-economy stands for an economic concept that intends to replace fossil resources (raw 
materials and fuels) with renewable raw materials in as many areas and applications as 
possible. It covers all industrial and economic sectors that produce, process, or use biological 
resources.  Bio-economy  offers  a  great  opportunity  to  meet  global  challenges  such  as 
progressing climate change, food and water scarcity, and growing pollution levels while also 
strengthening economic development. 
The conversion of the current fossil economic system was anchored as a lighthouse project in 
the #mission2030 in 2018 and has been implemented by the Austrian bio-economy strategy 
42 
  
since 2019. The bio-economy strategy provides orientation for all areas in need of actions and 
is intended to help counter potential conflicts and optimise synergies at an early stage by 
coordinating with the Sustainable Development Goals made binding in the Agenda 2030. 
Bio-economy is also a source of many new opportunities for Austria as a business location 
especially  in  connection  with  the  use  of  regional,  renewable  raw  materials.  The 
competitiveness of Austria’s economy will be improved, the supply of quality food guaranteed, 
jobs  created  in  rural  areas,  negative  environmental  effects  minimised,  greenhouse  gas 
emissions reduced, and a general change in thinking set in motion. And it will make a key 
contribution to reaching the objectives of the Paris Agreement.  
Bio-economy in Austria 
Austria  can  build  on  a  variety  of  strengths  thanks  to  its  natural  resources,  innovative 
companies, and respected research institutions. The associated bio-economy-relevant value 
chains form an excellent basis.  
Research, development, and innovation are key drivers of the development of bio-economy. 
In addition to technological development, the systematic connection of technical/scientific, 
economic, political/social, and ethical aspects is a key success factor for the reorientation of 
our future economic system. Especially the humanities, social and cultural sciences can lay the 
foundation  for  solutions  to  major  social  challenges  such  as  advancing  climate  change. 
Therefore, the further strategic development of the framework conditions envisages and 
increased participation of these disciplines. 
In addition to efficiency measures, sufficiency measures and lifecycle concepts are important 
pillars for the transformation of the economic system through the Austrian bio-economy 
strategy. Especially cascading utilisation options must be increasingly taken into account to 
first achieve a sustainable economy and eventually a circular economy. However, it will be 
necessary to place a greater focus on consumer behaviour than on concrete production and 
conversion measures since only a change in consumer behaviour can lead to a sustainable 
transition in the economic system. 
In terms of resources, Austrian agricultural and forestry operations provide a wide range of raw 
materials for the bio-economy. For a sustainable transformation of the economic system, 
however, it is necessary to increase the added value per hectare, apply new innovative 
production technologies and achieve the most efficient and sustainable use of raw materials 
(resource efficiency).The direct substitution of all fossil materials with biogenic materials 
would result in additional land requirements. However, the use of renewable raw materials will 
increase compared to the total use raw material. This will require efficiency and output 
increases, and there is substantial potential for the use of waste, residual materials, and by-
products in addition to traditional raw materials from agriculture and forestry. New concepts 
such  as  urban  farming,  greenhouses,  and  closed  production  systems  will  also  become 
increasingly important for expanding the raw materials base. 
43 
  
The potential for biogenic products is as broad as the variety of available raw materials. 
Working from its existing strengths, Austria should position itself as the technology leader in 
pulp and fibre products and in sawmill and timber products in Europe, for example. The aim is 
to support the founding and settlement of companies in the bio-based industry, to strengthen 
the market for these products, to promote the creation of new jobs, and to adapt the 
educational system. 
Political instruments must be integrated and coordinated at all levels of government to provide 
optimal support for the implementation of the bio-economy in Austria. This will be the only 
way to ensure a cost-effective transition to a bio-based economy and achieve the objective of 
decarbonisation. 
2.4.3  Transport 
2.4.3.1  Introduction and target vision 
During the public consultation in summer 2019, measures targeting the decarbonisation of the 
transport sector were rated as being particularly effective and have thus been assigned a high 
priority. Substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved by reducing 
traffic volumes, effecting a modal shift to public transport (for passenger and freight traffic), 
active mobility, and by transitioning to electric vehicles powered by renewable sources. 
In the target vision a turnaround in transport has been achieved in 2050, and the transport 
sector in Austria has been largely decarbonised. Emissions from passenger and freight traffic 
have been reduced to the absolutely necessary minimum. The population and companies are 
profiting from substantially improved environmental and health conditions.  
Local economies, intelligent land use planning, and expanded town centres enable short travel 
distances that can be covered actively, on foot or by bicycle. The population is an active part of 
the mobility transformation and is aware of the benefits, especially in the form of a higher 
quality of life. Public transport forms the strong backbone of the transportation system in 
urban areas and on regional and long-haul routes outside of cities. In part because public 
transport has been promoted through regulatory measures and has become the lower-cost 
means  of  transport  due  to  fiscal  measures.  As  a  result  of  the  transformation  mobility 
opportunities are now more fairly distributed throughout Austria, and there is also a free choice 
of different forms of mobility in rural areas. This diversity of mobility offers will play an 
important role in making rural areas a particularly attractive place to live for all generations.   
44 
  
Individualised  mobility  concepts  have  been  created  by  more  and  more  companies, 
communities, and associations in Austria. As a result, more employees travel to work by bicycle 
or public transport, and business trips are done with public transport or by carpooling in an 
electric vehicle. Flights within the EU have become substantially less attractive thanks to 
modern video conferencing systems and a convenient EU-wide night train system, and are 
much less in demand. 
At the same time, the transformation will be supported by technological developments such 
as electric and fuel cell vehicles powered by electricity or hydrogen from renewable sources 
and equipped with user-friendly information technologies. The implementation of innovative 
transport and mobility solutions has improved access to climate-friendly mobility for all groups 
of population and ensures the efficient connection of all businesses in a decarbonised transport 
system. The transition of the mobility sector to largely renewable energy produced in Austria 
will strengthen the domestic economy and increase national value creation. 
2.4.3.2  Current situation in Austria 
Road transport was one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions in Austria in 2017 at 
close to 29%. Passenger traffic is responsible for 64% of emissions in road transport, and 
freight traffic for 36%.5 The greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector (including fuel 
exports) rose by around 80% between 1990 and 2005, before a trend reversal could be 
observed in the following years, particularly through the addition of biofuels, innovative 
projects for climate-friendly mobility management as well as changed economic conditions. 
However, greenhouse gas emissions rose again for the third time in a row in 2017 to reach 23.6 
million tonnes of CO equivalents.6 
2
The current transport system is strongly characterized by individual motorised transport on the 
road, both for passenger and freight transport. This system is supported by infrastructural and 
fiscal conditions that cause an imbalance in mobility costs because not all external costs have 
yet been internalised for all modes of transport. If these conditions are not changed, passenger 
traffic volume would increase by around 25% between 2017 and 2050, and freight traffic by 
around 35%.7

45 
  
A switch to more climate-friendly and efficient modes of transport and technologies is needed 
to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Transport choices should be 
made based on the principles of “avoid, shift and improve.”  
2.4.3.3  Legal and political framework in the transport sector 
The transport sector must make its proportionate contribution to greenhouse gas reductions 
in order to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement. In light of the greenhouse gas 
reductions required by 2030, ambitious reduction targets were developed for new passenger 
cars, light commercial vehicles8, and heavy-duty vehicles9 during Austria’s presidency of the 
EU Council of Ministers in the second half of 2018. The CO  fleet targets require automobile 
2
manufacturers  to  reduce  the  average  emissions  of  their  new  passenger  cars  and  light 
commercial vehicles by 15% from 2025 and by 37.5% from 2030 (31% for light commercial 
vehicles) compared with 2021 levels. The achievement of existing fleet targets is an important 
milestone on the way to decarbonisation.  
Another  element  of  the  transformation  that  was  set  into  motion  during  the  Austrian 
Presidency of the EU Council of Ministers is the Graz Declaration10 . This declaration was 
adopted at the informal meeting of the environment and transport ministers in Graz. The 
document contains the fundamental strategic requirements for the decarbonisation of the 
transport sector in Austria. The Graz Declaration states “A holistic transformation policy 
approach is required, combining actions and making use of synergies...”11. This approach is to 
be supported by corresponding incentives and infrastructure and requires measures that are 
aimed at behavioural changes, effective mobility management, and technological innovation 
in the areas of vehicles and fuels, and the promotion of active mobility without losing sight of 
social aspects of the transformation of the transport sector.  
With #mission2030, Austria presented an ambitious climate and energy strategy in June 2018 
. Transport plays a key role in this strategy. #mission2030 recognises the importance of 
mobility as a basic human need and stands for an open economy. 
To this end, #mission2030 identifies the central aspects of the mobility transformation: E-
mobility on the basis of renewable energy sources; fuel cell vehicles with hydrogen as a

renewable energy source for the applications that are difficult to electrify; alternative drives 
and fuels; increased use of public transport; active mobility (bicycle and foot traffic) promoted 
by corresponding infrastructure and made accessible by attractive mobility services; shift in 
freight traffic to rail and expansion of combined transport. This will provide additional value for 
the affected citizens and for companies because the new forms of mobility are environmentally 
friendlier and healthier. The Cycling Master Plan12 aims to double the share of bicycle traffic 
from 7% to 13% by 2050. The Walking Master Plan13 creates incentives for walking.  
This is to be supplemented by the “creation of suitable economic conditions and target-group 
specific offerings and measures for freight and passenger traffic”14 together with a supportive 
legislative framework as a “central requirement for attaining a sustainable and decarbonised 
transport system”.15  
2.4.3.4  Fields of action 
2.4.3.4.1 A holistic approach for the transformation of the transport sector  
The transformation of the transport sector towards decarbonisation can only succeed through 
a holistic approach16  and an increased level of environmental awareness among all actors 
involved. In addition to technological innovations and improvements on the supply side, this 
holistic approach must also include measures on the demand side and behavioural changes 
and make optimum use of synergies between them. The social impacts of various measures 
must also be taken into account and mitigated by accompanying measures where necessary. 
The fundamental objective is to shift to clean, climate-friendly modes of transport, improve 
capacity utilisation in freight and passenger traffic, and avoid traffic. At the same time, a 
holistic  framework  for  the  mobility  transformation  will  be  created  through  consistent 
investments, supporting conditions and incentives, and continued research and innovation. 
The ultimate goal of the transformation of the transport sector must be to make mobility more 
climate-friendly, in other words continuously reducing the share of fossil fuels used. This will 
require the conversion of the associated physical and especially digital infrastructures. One 
driver of decarbonisation is the progress being made in battery technology, which makes 
batteries and electric motors smaller and cheaper. Such a progress replaces fossil-fuel drives

with electric drives systems. Research is not only aimed at improving the technologies, but also 
at understanding how mobility needs change over time (the social science level). The key focus 
of this research is how traffic and transport volumes in the system can be sustainably reduced. 
Researchers and policymakers are working hand in hand to achieve a broad consensus through 
effective awareness-raising programmes. 
The transformation will also rely on improved offers in local and regional transport, traffic flow 
optimisation  to  make  more  efficient  use  of  infrastructure,  mobility  management  for 
companies, towns, and tourism, and the use of digitalisation for mobility services such as car 
and ride sharing, as well as on improved pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure.17 The bicycle as 
a climate-neutral vehicle closes the crucial gap between public transportation and the “last 
mile” in a decarbonised transport system. The bicycle is an ideal complement to public rail 
transport especially in urban areas thanks to its flexibility, and is a good alternative to a motor 
vehicle thanks to the little space that it requires. The positive effects that active mobility has 
on health are also important in this context, and are economically relevant. The transformation 
of the mobility system will lead to the increased use of active mobility forms (walking and 
bicycling). This will reduce the number of sick days of people, and will increase their life 
expectancy. 
The economic conditions, especially investments by and contracts from public agencies, public 
funding, and the tax system have a major influence on mobility behaviour and the volume of 
traffic. The selection of where to live and work and the quality and energy consumption 
intensity of the chosen means of transport are based on the economic conditions. The 
elimination of counterproductive financial measures, especially the sending of correct price 
signals  to  market  participants,  is  a  key  prerequisite  for  achieving  a  sustainable  and 
decarbonised transport system.18 If these goals are to be reached, it will also be necessary to 
coordinate strategies and areas of action between the federal, provincial, and municipal 
governments,  to  identify  and  eliminate  regulations  that  are  counterproductive  for 
decarbonisation, and to coordinate the legal framework between the regional authorities to 
facilitate the implementation of a decarbonised transport system.19

2.4.3.4.2 Reducing traffic by the scheme “avoidance, modal shifts, and 
improvement”  
The mobility transformation will be achieved by following these principles.  
  Avoidance 
The increased digitalisation of work is bringing the workplace and home closer together again, 
and  mobility  management  will  help  to  avoid  unnecessary  travel.  The  previously  long 
commutes to work will be replaced by short trips close to home. This trend will increase the 
potential for the use of bicycles as a quick mode of transport for short distances. The town 
structures in rural areas will have a higher density in 2050, which will make walking more 
attractive and will shift a certain share of transport to foot and bicycle traffic. Accompanying 
measures will revitalise town centres, this is shown e.g. by the fact that there are more small 
shops and grocers in towns. This will shorten the distances that need to be covered, and traffic 
will be effectively avoided.  
Modern urban and land use planning will focus on minimising the use of resources and avoiding 
traffic. For example, the requirement for developers to provide parking spaces for cars when 
erecting new residential buildings has been replaced with measures for accessing public 
transport. These and further measures (such as zones with combined motor vehicle, bicycle, 
and foot traffic) are leading to a reduction of motorised traffic in cities. 
Global goods transport is increasingly being replaced with regional economies, and a resource-
efficient circular economy is the norm. There is no more planned obsolescence in 2050, all 
products and goods are designed to be long-lasting and repairable. Society demands more 
sustainable products and services in general. 
  Modal shifts 
Individual motorised traffic is less common in 2050 than today – the modal split has shifted to 
public  transport  and  active  mobility.  This  has  been  effected  above  all  by  increased 
environmental awareness among the population thanks to targeted measures. Innovative, 
holistic  mobility  solutions  will  also  cover  the  last  mile,  for  example  tailored  mobility 
management, on-demand buses, electric taxis, car sharing, and the massive expansion of 
public transport. 
Public transport intervals are considerably shorter, and customer-friendly service planning and 
information provision make rail and bus travel more attractive. 
Freight transport by rail has profited from the reduction of regulatory hurdles. The external 
costs of all modes of transport will be internalised during the mobility transformation. This 
49 
  
means that the most environmentally friendly modes of transport are also the cheapest. This 
will cause a preference for these modes of transport. The volume of individual motorised traffic 
and short-haul flights has decreased considerably. 
  Improvement 
The objective is to strive for the highest possible energy efficiency and a switch to renewable 
energy sources. In practice, this means that vehicles powered by electricity from renewable 
sources and green hydrogen are used on the roads while vehicles powered by fossil fuels are a 
thing of the past in 2050. For passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, this will primarily 
be achieved by a switch to electric vehicles powered entirely by electricity from renewable 
sources. Increasing electrification is also being pursued for heavy-duty vehicles. Fuel cell 
vehicles using hydrogen from renewable sources are an important option especially for 
applications that are difficult to electrify (such as heavy goods vehicles for long-haul transport). 
Electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles offer the possibility to use 100% renewable energy and 
are also considerably more efficient than petrol and diesel vehicles. Eco-driving training 
teaches drivers how to use and operate their vehicles as efficiently as possible. 
The rail infrastructure is 100% electrified and powers the trains entirely with electricity from 
renewable sources. The majority of freight transport has been shifted to the rails, and the 
remaining goods transports are handled with non-fossil drives (electromobility, in part with 
overhead-line lorries, and with hydrogen). The role of inland shipping, which is to switch to 
renewable energy, has increased considerably. 
E-fuels produced in the EU through new and innovative technologies and second-generation 
biofuels will especially be used in aviation. 
The time required for the relevant approval processes (especially for passenger and freight 
transport by rail) is to be shortened so that the efficiency gains can be realised rapidly enough. 
2.4.3.5  Lifestyles in 2050: People and companies profit from the mobility 
transformation 
Future  land  use  planning  can  substantially  reduce  mobility  pressure.  The  surface  space 
required in cities for vehicle parking and traffic has been decreased substantially through a 
wide range of measures (expansion of public transport, sharing offers, etc.), which has been 
very well received by the population. There is more green space, and this has made cities more 
resilient against the increasing number of heat waves and nights with high temperatures. The 
air and noise pollution from traffic has been drastically reduced.  
50 
  
Rural areas are well serviced by an intelligent combination of micro public transport systems, 
intermodal interfaces in larger towns, and a robust public transport network. 
All in all, the expenses for mobility services have declined without the population feeling 
restricted in their mobility.  
Examples  of  mobility  and  transport  patterns  in  different  areas  of  life  with  a  largely 
decarbonised transport sector in the year 2050 are described in the Annex (section 6.3).  
2.4.4  Buildings 
2.4.4.1  Introduction and target vision 
The  building  sector  (residential  and  commercial  buildings)  generated  greenhouse  gas 
emissions of 8.3 million tonnes of CO  equivalents, or 10% of the total emissions, in 2017.  Even 
2
though greenhouse gas emissions from buildings have been reduced substantially over the 
past decades, there is still great savings potential in this sector. The federal government’s 
#mission2030 climate and energy strategy and the draft of the National Energy and Climate 
Plan contain the goal of saving roughly 3 million tonnes of CO  equivalents compared with 2016 
2
in the building sector in a socially and economically compatible manner. The sector is to be 
decarbonised to the greatest extent possible by 2050.  
The target vision for 2050 is therefore buildings that are heated and cooled virtually free of 
CO  emissions, and that are also supplied with hot water exclusively via renewable energy 
2
sources.  The planning through to 2050 includes not only development areas for different uses 
such as residential, leisure, industry, and commercial, but also power supply infrastructure for 
these areas that only makes use of renewable energy. This involves the consideration of power 
supply and sustainable mobility criteria during the planning and zoning of these areas. Spatial 
planning, zoning, and development planning have had the effect that sealing of areas has been 
reduced  and  the  demand  for  heat  condensed,  waste  heat  potentials  can  be  used  very 
effectively and a large share of heating and cooling in buildings can be effected with grid-
bound energy sources such as district and local heating and renewable gas.  
Buildings constructed over the past decades consume very little energy themselves and play 
an active role in the provision of energy through rooftop photovoltaic and solar collectors as 
well as the storage of energy. In concrete terms, this means that only low-energy buildings 
(NZEB) and plus-energy buildings are constructed. Public agencies have been acting as role 
models in this, and all new public buildings have been low-energy buildings since 1 January 
51 
  
2019.  In  2050,  the  majority  of  the  buildings  erected  since  2020  have  been  built  in 
conglomerations where they form plus-energy neighbourhoods. Newly constructed buildings 
that cannot be heated and cooled with grid-bound energy sources only use renewable energy 
and are built as plus-energy buildings that generate more energy than they need.  
Existing buildings have been upgraded to a modern thermal and energy standard by 2050. This 
means that heating and cooling of these buildings will only need a fraction of the energy 
needed today. These remaining energy needs will be covered by grid-bound energy sources 
using renewable sources. Decentralised renewable generation facilities and heat pumps will be 
used  where  no  grid-bound  heating  supply  is  possible.  Fossil  fuels  will  only  be  used  in 
exceptional cases if alternatives are technically not feasible or would be inefficient based on 
material economic costs and benefits. 
The need for cooling energy has risen substantially resulting from climate change and urban 
heat islands. Building designs are being adapted to avoid summer cooling loads, or if this is not 
feasible, passive and active measures in buildings shall protect against overheating in the 
summer. Many buildings have smart storage facilities such as component activation as well as 
green roofs and facades.  
The involvement of other sectors such as low-carbon manufacturing of products and the 
circular economy also contributes to the decarbonisation of the building sector. Buildings are 
also used as greenhouse gas sinks by selecting sustainable construction materials (for example 
from renewable raw materials). 
In order to ensure the sustainable use of buildings over long periods, these must provide 
sufficient flexibility in their use. “Multi-generational buildings” allow for rapid and low-resource 
changes in the use of buildings, which limits and prevents extensive land use as well as 
oversizing.  
District  heating  plays  a  central  role  in  urban  areas  with  high  heat  absorption  densities 
combined with close proximities to capable suppliers of waste heat. Local bidirectional (low 
temperature) grids improve the ability to store heat, distribute heat in an energy-efficient 
manner, efficiently incorporate renewable heat, and to use different waste heat sources, 
respectively locally from geothermy and seasonally stored geothermal heat.  
Due to the use of heat pumps, electrical energy accounts for a large share of the total energy 
demand for space heating, hot water supply and cooling of buildings. Efficient heat pumps and 
biogenic energy sources combined with solar thermal collectors dominate the decentralised 
provision of heating energy. Nearly all suitable roof surfaces are used for photovoltaics, and 
52 
  
the share of facade surfaces used to collect energy (such as solar thermal and photovoltaic 
elements) is increasing rapidly. 
 
These positive developments were made possible in part by convincing building users and 
owners, neighbours, investors, and other stakeholders of the usefulness and necessity of these 
changes. Through targeted information provision and involvement of affected stakeholders, 
acceptance was created even for measures that have disadvantages on individual groups.  
2.4.4.2  Current situation in Austria 
Around 82.3 million tonnes of CO  equivalents were emitted in Austria in 2017. The building 
2
sector (residential and commercial buildings) generated greenhouse gas emissions of 8.3 
million tonnes of CO  equivalents, or 10% of total emissions, in 2017. Emissions fell by 4.5 
2
million tonnes of CO  equivalents20 between 1990 and 2017.  
2
Per capita living space consumption was 23 m² in 1970 and 37 m² in 1990, and has now almost 
doubled to nearly 45 m²21 in a period of 40 years according to the most recent statistic. The 
population of Austria grew by around one million people in the same time period22. Despite 
this trend which resulted in a substantial increase in the total conditioned space, greenhouse 
gas emissions in the building sector (excluding greenhouse gas emissions from the generation 
of electricity and heat of the energy industry) have decreased by around 4.8 million tonnes of 
CO  equivalents since 199023.

district heating and electricity. Source: Federal Environment Agency: Greenhouse Gas Inventory 2017

Space heating and cooling account for nearly 27% of the total energy demand in buildings24. 
About four fifths of the energy consumed by households is used for space heating and around 
one fifth for water heating;25 if efficiency improvements in building envelopes are promoted, it 
is likely that the share of energy for water heating will increase. Heating systems operated with 
fossil fuels (heating oil, natural gas) still play a substantial role despite the fact that the share 
of renewable energy sources has increased in recent years (see the figure below). Natural gas 
is an important source of energy in Austria and is delivered through a dense distribution grid.

2.4.4.3  Results of the online consultation 
As shown by the online consultation (see 1.2.4.1.), the objective of making the building sector 
climate neutral is feasible with reasonable effort and has high priority.  
The further questions pertained to various measures (see below). The following were ranked 
as measures with substantial effects: 
  more stringent approval criteria in order to realise savings potential in buildings,  
  energy efficiency as savings potential in buildings, and  
  the promotion of renewable energy sources and gradual reduction of fossil fuels. 
Measures with moderate to major effects: 
  regulations for climate-adapted/climate-neutral land use planning, 
  climate-friendly adaptation of development planning, and 
  use of sealed areas for savings potential in buildings. 
2.4.4.4  Fields of action 
The following fields of action are planned for the building sector: 
55 
  
2.4.4.4.1 New buildings 
Buildings must at least meet the nearly zero-energy building standards, use little energy for 
heating and cooling, and play an active role in the provision of energy through rooftop 
photovoltaic and solar collector systems and through energy storage (e.g. via component 
activation). In 2050, the majority of the buildings erected since 2020 need considerably less 
energy for heating and cooling and are generally built in conglomerations where they form 
plus-energy neighbourhoods. Newly constructed buildings that cannot be heated and cooled 
with grid-bound energy sources only use renewable energy and are built as plus-energy 
buildings  that  generate  more  energy  than  they  consume.  Sustainable,  renewable  raw 
materials are used for buildings wherever possible and reasonable. 
2.4.4.4.2 Thermal and energy refurbishment of existing buildings and 
efficiency improvements for heating systems 
  The existing buildings will be brought up to future-proof thermal and energy standards 
by 2050. Existing buildings will then need considerably less energy for heating and 
cooling, which will substantially cut operating costs while significantly increasing living 
comfort. 
  A complete renovation concept will be drawn up for each existing building. This 
renovation concept will define a future-proof thermal and energy standard which is to 
be reached by 2050. This future-proof standard will be defined based on technical 
possibilities  and  economic  efficiency,  whereby  the  essential  economic  costs  and 
benefits are taken into consideration when determining the economic efficiency. The 
complete renovation concept comprises the steps necessary to achieve the future-
proof thermal and energy standard, whereby the reduction of the need for cooling 
energy plays an important role. All of these steps must be gradually implemented and 
completed by 2050.  
  The share of total residential units being completely renovated is to be increased from 
the present 1% to an average of 2% in the period from 2020 to 2030 according to 
#mission2030. Maintaining this renovation rate and converting the heating systems to 
renewable energy sources will allow all Austrian buildings to be decarbonised by 2050. 
Comprehensive  renovation  projects  can  also  be  completed  in  stages  within  the 
framework of the complete renovation concept. The future-proof standard will be 
achieved after the completion of all stages.  
  A coordinated mix of measures will be used to improve the thermal and energy 
standards of the existing buildings. This can include socially compatible amendments 
to housing law to facilitate renovation measures, for example a streamlined decision-
making process for legally establishing condominium ownership. Targeted funding for 
the renovation of buildings in the form of investment grants and/or tax reliefs will be 
56 
  
provided, and legal requirements for the implementation of renovation measures with 
a short amortisation period will be enacted for changes of ownership.  
  Information and awareness-raising activities as well as consulting (neutral, government 
funded, and public) are being planned, the quality of the energy certificate is to be 
improved, and data on existing buildings and the technologies used for heating and 
cooling will be collected in a structured manner (for example the register of buildings 
and apartments). 
2.4.4.4.3 Exit from liquid fossil fuels 
  New buildings are to be run without the use of fossil fuels, if possible. Oil heating 
systems  are  no  longer  to  be  used  in  new  buildings  by  2020  at  the  latest.  A 
corresponding federal law has already been passed. Some provinces have already 
implemented this goal. 
  According to the climate and energy strategy (#mission2030), around half of the 
roughly 700,000 oil heating systems currently in use are to be replaced with innovative, 
renewable energy systems or efficient district heating by 2030. All oil heating systems 
are to be replaced with renewable alternatives by 2040. One concrete measure for this 
will be the “renewable requirement”, which means that only heating systems based on 
highly efficient alternative energy sources are to be used as replacement for liquid 
fossil-fuel furnaces starting in 2021. Deviations from this requirement shall only be 
possible in justified exceptions. The existing heating systems powered by liquid fossil 
fuels will be successively replaced with systems powered by renewable energy sources 
or climate-friendly district heating starting in 2025. 
  No liquid fossil fuels are to be used in buildings owned by the federal and provincial 
governments by 2030.  
  A  coordinated  mix  of  long-term  anticipated  instruments    consisting  of  legal 
requirements  (such  as  a  prohibition  on  oil  heating  systems  in  new  buildings, 
renewables requirement when replacing oil heating systems, etc.), incentives in the 
form of digressive funding, especially to mitigate social impacts, as well as fiscal 
measures, needs to be implemented in order to achieve an exit from fossil fuels.  
2.4.4.4.4 Switch to renewable gas 
  The natural gas grid for space and water heating purposes shall not be expanded any 
further if possible. The addition of new connections for space and water heating is still 
possible in exceptions if justified by the unavailability of district heating. 
57 
  
  Fossil gas shall no longer be used in new residential and services buildings starting in 2021. 
Exceptions should only be granted in justified cases which require effective compensation 
measures in the form of the generation of renewable energy or energy savings.  
  When gas heating systems are replaced, fossil gas is only to be used again if there is no 
technically or economically feasible option for the use of renewable energy sources or if 
the use of a heating system powered by renewable energy sources26  would not be 
economical, with the economic costs and benefits being taken into account in determining 
the economic efficiency. 
  Fossil gas will be increasingly replaced with renewable and synthetic gas in order to ensure 
a CO -neutral gas supply by 2050. 
2
  To achieve the exit from fossil gas by no later than 2050, a coordinated mix of long-term 
anticipated instruments is needed. These consist of incentives in the form of funding for 
renewable heating systems which shall also mitigate social impacts, fiscal measures, and 
especially requirements and funding for the replacement of fossil gas with renewable gas. 
  Decentralised hydrogen production and consumption, such as in energy collectives, will 
allow for an efficient integration and use of locally generated renewable energy and will 
bolster local supply security.  
2.4.4.4.5 Energy spatial planning 
  Criteria for climate-friendly energy supply and generation as well as for climate-friendly 
mobility must be taken into account in spatial planning, zoning, and development 
planning.  
  Areas should be defined in a way that buildings can be supplied with space and water 
heating energy and cooling energy from renewable sources to the greatest extent 
possible. In areas that are or will be equipped with heating/cooling energy grids (such 
as district heating), the heating consumer density should be increased through spatial 
planning/zoning/development planning.  
  The construction of buildings in existing residential areas, incorporating different 
functions into residential areas, and the supply of these areas with public and climate-
friendly transport options will be indispensable. Local construction codes and parking 
space regulations are also important instruments in ensuring climate-friendly mobility. 
2.4.4.4.6 District heating/cooling and waste heat 
  Supplying  buildings  and  businesses  with  efficient  district  heating  generated  from 
renewable sources will continue to play an important role, especially in urban areas.  
                                                                 
26 This does not mean “green gas tariffs”. 
58 
  
  In addition to the generation from different renewable sources (biomass, ambient heat, 
solar thermal collectors, etc.) as well as combined heat and power generation, feeding 
waste heat from businesses and homes into the system will also play an important role. In 
this regard, there is still extensive untapped potential in Austria. Seasonal heat storage will 
replace heating plants in some cases. 
  In the future, instruments of spatial energy planning, subsidies and legal requirements 
(obligation to purchase waste heat, obligation to feed waste heat into the grid) shall be 
used to set strengthened impulses for waste heat utilization. 
2.4.4.4.7 Buildings as part of the power supply infrastructure 
  Buildings shall not only meet high energy standards, but above all play an active role in the 
provision of energy and the storage of energy for self-supply. Therefore, suitable spaces 
on buildings shall be used for rooftop and facade installations, and integrated photovoltaic 
systems are to be used to the greatest degree possible (especially for new construction 
and renovation projects). The expansion of photovoltaic infrastructure combined with 
storage technologies – especially at the building level – will make a contribution to 
reducing  the  burden  on  the  transmission  and  distribution  grids  (Lighthouse  6  in 
#mission2030: 100,000 rooftop photovoltaic systems and local storage programme). 
2.4.5  Agriculture and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) 
2.4.5.1  Introduction and target vision 
Globally, human nutrition is one of the largest sources of human-made greenhouse gas 
emissions, amongst other things through induced land-use changes. Consequently, there is 
immense potential in climate action in extending and expanding climate-friendly food supply, 
which should also be labelled uniformly and comprehensively for consumer throughout the EU 
according to its origin and greenhouse gas footprint. 
As one of the most directly affected sectors, Austrian agriculture and forestry must increase its 
resilience and adaptability in order to continue to uphold the supply of food and raw materials 
as well as to provide ecosystem functions in the future. Simultaneously, the sector is an 
indispensable part of the solution and can make important contributions to achieving the 
climate and energy targets. For this purpose, the rising social demands for sustainable and 
resource-conserving management regarding animal protection, biodiversity, soil, water, and 
climate and the maintenance of functioning ecosystems must be met. 
59 
  
2.4.5.2  Current situation in Austria 
Agriculture and forestry are assigned an important role in the EU’s LTS 2050. The potential for 
greenhouse gas emission reductions in agriculture and forestry is regarded as limited when 
compared  with  other  sectors,  however,  the  sectors’  ability  to  store  carbon  has  been 
emphasized.  
On the one hand agriculture and forestry are sectors heavily impacted by climate change, on 
the other hand they also contribute significantly to climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions 
from agriculture accounted for around 10% of total Austrian emissions in 2017. The forests and 
soil in Austria are a net sink for greenhouse gas emissions. This sink accounted for 4,906 
thousand tonnes of CO  equivalents in 2017. To reduce emissions from agriculture, especially 
2
the greenhouse gases methane (CH ) and nitrous oxide (N O) resulting from livestock farming 
4 2
and fodder cultivation must decline. Meat consumption in Austria is currently above average. 
Climate-friendly innovations in the production of animal products and feed combined with a 
greater focus on high quality food as well as on seasonal and regional products will reduce the 
carbon footprint of food substantially. The production of plant-based foods also plays an 
important role as it does not only have the potential to reduce emissions through climate-
friendly farming methods, but can also be used for the targeted capture of CO .  
2
2.4.5.3  Results of the online consultation 
The following target visions were defined for Austrian agriculture and forestry through the 
online consultation (see 1.2.4.1.):  
  Austrian agriculture and forestry is part of the solution on climate action and must be 
adapted more effectively to climate change in order to secure food production in the 
future, preserve grassland, and to provide a livelihood for the agriculture and forestry 
workers over the long term.  
  The soil fertility of cultivated land and grassland is to be maintained and the carbon 
content increased further.  
  Regional  and  seasonal  products  are  climate-friendly;  the  supply  of  regional  and 
seasonal products for the population is to be ensured.  
  The forests are to be converted into potential natural forest communities with tree 
species adapted to climate change.  
  The forests are to continue supplying raw materials for the decarbonisation of the 
economic system in the future and maintain and expand their function as a stable 
carbon sink.  
60 
  
Soil is an important carbon reservoir. The increasing frequency of extreme weather events 
(such as heavy rainfall and heat waves) is exacerbating the problem of increased land use. Land 
consumption should be reduced through sensible spatial planning. Annual land use is to be 
drastically reduced and currently sealed areas are to be restored to a natural state. 
Spatial planning in rural areas shall prevent further urban sprawl and fragmentation of areas. 
City centres are to be strengthened, local supply as well as the connection to public transport 
shall be ensured. In this way, mobility constraints can be avoided. 
The results of the consultation show that the target visions are of high relevance for achieving 
the goal of climate neutrality in 2050. It should be possible to achieve the necessary activities 
with a financial effort approximately in the next 10 to 20 years.  
2.4.5.4  Fields of action 
A  central  element  of  Austrian  agricultural  policy  is  the  support  of  a  competitive, 
environmentally friendly, resource-saving, comprehensive agriculture, which is often based on 
family farms. 
The EU’s Common Agricultural Policy will continue to support agriculture which is oriented 
towards climate action, including both mitigation and adaption, in part through the continued 
expansion of agri-environmental and climate measures. 
Climate-friendly  livestock  farming  that  ensures  animal  wellbeing  can  contribute  to  the 
production  of  climate-friendly  products  when  combined  with  lower-nitrogen  feeding 
techniques (such as optimising feed quantities and feed quality). This especially pertains to 
locally  adapted  area-related  livestock  and  location-oriented  fertiliser  quantities,  pasture 
grazing, and the reduction of concentrated feed and silage maize in dairy farming. 
Specific measures such as the reduction of the use of mineral nitrogen fertilisers through 
optimisation of the whole fertiliser chain, as well as the optimisation of humus and soil carbon 
content (e.g. through consistent recycling of harvest residues, cultivation of greenery catch 
crops, environmentally sound crop rotation, mulch and direct  sowing) also make a key 
contribution  to  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  share  of  organic  farming  and 
measures for sustainable conventional agriculture (such as precision farming) should also be 
increased substantially. Digitalisation and smart technologies form the basis for precision 
farming resulting in the optimised use of fertilisers and pesticides. 
61 
  
Agriculture can also make an important contribution to the energy transformation through the 
fermentation  of  additional  agricultural  residues  and  waste  to  produce  biomethane. 
Fermenting manure before spreading it on fields not only substitutes fossil energy but also 
saves greenhouse gas emissions from manure storage. (BMNT, final NECP, 2019) 
The  system  transitions  needed  to  reach  the  climate  goals  in  the  Paris  Agreement  are 
unprecedented in scale according to the IPCC special report27. In addition to the impacts of 
climate change on agriculture and forestry output, the planned expansion of renewable energy 
(“greening the gas”) and bio-economy will bring significant changes to agriculture and forestry. 
The competition for resources (land, arable soil, water, biomass, etc.) is therefore likely to 
increase. Against this background, the objectives of ensuring food security, of providing 
renewable raw materials, and of protecting the environment as well as combating climate 
change must all be coordinated. It is important to emphasize that the Alpine region is 
particularly affected by climatic changes, which is progressing faster here than in lowlands. 
This affects not only the mountain agriculture and forests, but also tourism is particularly 
negatively affected. The loss of land and changes in land use are highly climate relevant. As 
rising emissions in the future and a reduction in storage in the LULUCF sector lead to deficits, 
the carbon sink function of these areas will increase in importance. If land loss in Austria 
continues and the ability of the soil to store carbon decreases due to rising temperatures, 
maintaining the current quantity of carbon stored in Austria’s soil will become increasingly 
challenging. 
  The containment of greenhouse gas emissions to a declining emission level will be 
achieved as outlined in the transition scenario. This is based on assumptions about 
further efficiency increases in the use of nitrogen, the increased keeping of dual-
purpose cattle, optimised use of manure, and changes in dietary habits that have an 
impact on livestock farming. Greenhouse gas aspects will be taken more into account 
in national funding and funding under the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). 
  Very ambitious measures will be taken to prevent nitrogen losses. 
  Dual-purpose cattle (milk and meat) and increased pasture grazing will be promoted. 
  Organic farming will be expanded further. 
  Agricultural production is adapted optimally to the local and environmental conditions 
and a circular economy has been established. 
  Optimal use of manure (e.g. through liquid manure markets) and substantial reduction 
of mineral fertiliser use. 
                                                                 
27 IPCC special report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and 
greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems 
62 
  
  The population has changed its dietary habits which are now based on high-quality 
plant  foods  and  reduced  meat  consumption.  Alternative  protein  sources  with 
substantially lower CO  intensity (such as algae) will be used for animal feed and other 
2
applications. 
  Food waste will be reduced substantially. 
2.4.5.5  Fields of action in forestry 
Austria’s woods and forest policy is based on the principle of multi-functionality, through which 
all functions of the forest are to be considered in a balanced way. The various forest policy 
activities are discussed and coordinated through the Austrian Forest Dialogue, which was 
launched as an open, continuous, and participative policy development process in 2001. The 
first Austrian forest programme was adopted in 2005. Supported by the close coordination of 
forestry policy measures, the use of wood has significantly increased in recent years, whereby 
the total loss according to the current ÖWI amounts to 88% of the growth. The Forest 
Programme 2020+ was drawn up on the basis of the original Austrian forest programme in 
2018 and comprises the forest policy cornerstones for the coming years. The Austrian Forest 
Strategy 2020+ accounts for political requirements from current national and international 
forest-related strategies, programmes, and processes. This includes the Austrian Biodiversity 
Strategy 2020+28 , the Austrian Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change29 , the EU Forest 
Strategy, the Forest Europe process, and the United Nations Forest Forum (UNFF), the 
Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and 
especially the objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) as well as the Paris Agreement. The contribution of forests to climate action has 
been assigned to a separate action area in the Forest Strategy 2020+ in order to effectively 
address the relevance of forests for the global climate system. This was also confirmed with 
the goals of the Paris Agreement, which sets out a long-term emission pathway to maintaining 
the 2°C or 1.5°C target by achieving a balance between emissions by sources and removals by 
sinks in the second half of the century.  
Through the implementation of #mission203030 the bio-economy strategy31 was developed in 
2019 with the intention of initiating and supporting processes for the transition from the 
current fossil economical system and of significantly contributing to achieving the climate

targets. The concept of bio-economy covers raw materials as a source (agriculture and forestry, 
water management, and waste) on the one hand and the use of these biogenic raw materials 
(food and feed, chemicals, materials, and energy) on the other.  
This shows that a wide range of requirements are placed on Austria’s forests, which are 
implemented through the framework of a sustainable management strategy. This should 
ensure that the raw materials for the bio-economy and the transition to renewable energy are 
provided and that the ecosystems are adapted to the climate crisis with the goal of improving 
the stability and productivity of Austria’s forest stock. As measures for reducing emissions and 
measures for adapting to climate change are often closely related in agriculture and forestry, 
such measures must be implemented in accordance with the recommendations for action in 
the Austrian Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change. 
  Only a holistic approach can ensure that an optimal contribution is made to reaching the 
goal of national climate neutrality by 2050. This approach encompasses sustainable forest 
management including an adaption of the forest to climate change in order to increase 
resilience and stability of the forest stock so that productivity can be maintained and 
increased in the future. Carbon capture in the forestry sector has declined from around 11 
million tonnes of CO  to around 4 million tonnes of CO  from 1990 to 2017, corresponding 
2 2
with an increase of around 38% in logging since the beginning of the 2000s. Independent 
of this, forest area is increasing continuously and amounts currently to over 4 million 
hectares.  This  is  being  offset  by  emission  reductions  in  other  sectors  due  to  the 
replacement of other raw materials and fuels with a considerably larger carbon footprint. 
The use of wood prevents around 12.5 million tonnes of CO  emissions per year. The results 
2
of the CareForParis project also suggest that the effect of avoiding fossil CO  emissions 
2
(substitution effect) is at least twice as high as the effect of climate measures from 
capturing CO  in forests.

2.4.5.6  SCENARIO STORYLINES from the wood value chain project in 
201532 
The long-term effects of different forms of forest management on the national greenhouse 
gas balance were presented through various projects commissioned by the Climate and Energy 
Fund in 2012, starting from a reference scenario that is oriented towards the current forest 
management conditions. Representatives of the forestry and wood industries and of the 
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment, and Water Management drew up four further 
management scenarios in April 2013. These variants are intended to show possible effects of

on the greenhouse gas balance

different management extremes on the state of the forest and permit reactions to as yet 
unforeseen changes in the framework conditions under other scenarios. The scenarios in the 
wood value chain project show that the type of forest management is decisive for the future 
greenhouse gas balance.  
The forest is capable of capturing more carbon than it actually does under the current 
management system. However, such consideration which solely focuses on the forest is far too 
short-sighted, as from a systemic perspective the use of wood for the provision of raw 
materials for the bio-economy and the transition to renewable energy sources has a positive 
effect on the greenhouse gas balance over the long term. 
Building on the results  from the 2015 wood value chain project, the Austrian Research Centre 
for Forests (BFW), the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU), Wood K plus, 
and the Federal Environment Agency conducted further analyses in the follow-up project 
CareForParis. The project is in finalisation as of the end of 2019. Once the final results are 
available, the statements and scenarios above may be updated on the basis of the latest 
findings.  
2.4.6  Consumer behaviour and lifestyle 
2.4.6.1  Introduction and target vision 
The report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR 5) states that our 
current behaviour and lifestyle, which are associated with high greenhouse gas emissions, have 
a substantial impact on climate change, which has already reached an advanced stage. The 
report also stresses that it will be difficult to reach the goals in the Paris Agreement without 
serious changes to our energy and goods consumption, diet, leisure-time, and mobility 
choices. 
The changes needed to lead towards a climate-friendly lifestyle are a process that affects 
society as a whole. Even though the responsibility of each individual is becoming more 
important, consumption patterns cannot be changed by one person alone. These result from 
the interplay of personal consumption decisions, habits, social and economic norms, the 
offered infrastructure, and the prevailing policy framework. 
The impending effects of climate change imply an unprecedented degree of urgency to 
changing behaviours that are harmful to the climate in order to ensure a high quality of life for 
the entire population over the long term. The answers to the question of what a climate-neutral 
life may look like can only stem from innovative ideas, the courage to make changes and adopt 
new lifestyles, and should not be perceived as a restriction, but as a new opportunity. 
65 
  
2.4.6.2  Current situation in Austria 
According to a mid-level scenario of Statistics Austria, around 9.5 million people are expected 
to live in Austria in 2050, over 600,000 more people than today.   
The emissions under a consumption-based calculation model (which reflects the greenhouse 
gas emissions of the consumer goods which are consumed in Austria) are well above those 
under a product-based model (which indicates the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions 
caused by the production of consumer goods in Austria). This means that in addition to the 
greenhouse gas emissions from the inventory based on a territorial approach, the emissions 
caused by the consumption of the Austrian population are also relevant and must be taken into 
account in a comprehensive climate policy.   
2.4.6.2.1 Food 
Agriculture is responsible for around 10% of the greenhouse gas emissions in Austria (Federal 
Environment Agency, Climate Mitigation Report 2019). The coverage ratio is just under 93% 
according to the Green Report, taking imports and exports into account. The following can be 
said about the eating habits of the Austrian population: 
Roughly half of the direct emissions in Austria come from the production of meat and other 
animal products. The average per capita meat consumption (including poultry) in Austria was 
64.1 kg in 2018 (AMA, 2019). The degree of self-sufficiency is 108% according to the Green 
Report. Some 577,000 tonnes of avoidable food waste is produced along the entire value chain 
every year. Food waste is especially high in households (206,000 t) and food service (206,000 
t) but is also high in production (86,200 t), retail (74,100 t), and in the category returned goods 
bread and baked goods (35,600 t)33. 
2.4.6.2.2 Consumption 
On  the  one  hand  consumption  leads  to  “direct”  emissions  through  daily  actions  and 
behavioural patterns and on the other hand to hidden emissions in products (“grey emissions” 
from production in other countries, transport, and potentially disposal) on the other. This 
means that consumer behaviour plays a significant role in transitioning to a climate-friendly 
lifestyle. The level of emissions can be seen as a function of the quantity of consumption and 
the characteristics of the consumed good (acquisition, product use and disposal). 
Acquisition: Consumers have the choice between more and less sustainable products, within 
certain limits. Products can be rented, leased, borrowed, or shared. This can reduce resource 
use. 
                                                                 
33 Hietler & Pladerer, 2017 
66 
  
Product use: The useful lifespan of many products can be extended by repair, maintenance, 
upgrades, or the replacement of defective components. 
Product disposal: Consumers have different options for the handling of goods after their 
lifetime – re-use, upcycling, recycling, gifting.  
2.4.6.2.3 Leisure and tourism 
A relevant factor in measuring leisure and tourism is the number of trips taken and the means 
of transport chosen to reach the desired destination. 
The means of transport Austrians choose to reach their holiday destinations and to get around 
while on holiday have changed over the past decades. Driving by car and flying have increased, 
the latter by 28%. This has especially reduced the use of rail transport, which accounted for 
only 7% in 2017 (see also section 2.4.3 Transport).

Mobility 
See section 2.4.3 Transport 
2.4.6.3  Results of the online consultation 
The results of the online consultation show that strengthening climate-friendly behaviour has 
high priority. But it will entail considerable effort. 
In this context, it was particularly emphasized that work must be undertaken to transfer 
knowledge (e.g. better public relations and educational work in order to better communicate 
measures or even uncomfortable truths and to refute false information) to and to encourage 
identification with the topic in the population. We need sustainable solutions that will be 
accepted by the population.  
In  particular,  "steering"  measures  that  implied  the  feeling  of  "taking  away"  or  "forced 
renunciation" were mentioned as one of the greatest challenges.   
2.4.6.4  Fields of action  
Lifestyle changes represent a process involving society as a whole. With that in mind, the fields 
of action presented here must be seen as a set of areas for action which must be coordinated 
and implemented together. 
67 
  
Comprehensive and transparent information is the foundation for lifestyle changes and must 
be provided in a suitable manner for all age groups and education levels, including stronger 
integration into school curricula. It can be empirically demonstrated that information alone as 
a sole field of action is necessary but insufficient as a definite discrepancy can be seen between 
“environmental knowledge” and sustainable consumption. This means that further measures 
and incentives must be employed to aid the decision making of each individual, and to force 
certain decisions where necessary. Such measures will include bringing very different actors 
together as well as comprise financial incentives such as internalising external costs in order to 
come closer to the desired objective – the achievement of the long-term goals in the Paris 
Agreement. 
A climate-friendly lifestyle is possible if it is implemented gradually. Above all it can also be 
perceived as an opportunity for the economy and society. Our daily life is strongly shaped by 
habits. In order to change these, we need alternatives which are compatible with our daily life. 
The motivation to take action often fails due to lack of information and lack of alternatives. 
The following options for fields of action are presented in different areas in the literature: 
2.4.6.4.1 Food 
  Deposit on disposable beverage containers 
  Targeted  advertisements  for  more  “quality  instead  of  quantity”,  >  enhanced 
positioning of state quality seals, information to combat food waste 
  Better-tailored campaigns  
o  to support “quality from Austria”   
o  to educate about the safety of expired but still edible products  
o  on healthy nutrition based on the food pyramid, including the consideration 
of a climate-friendly diet, food offerings in public institutions and cafeterias 
should also be chosen accordingly 
  Promotion of urban gardening spaces and initiatives 
2.4.6.4.2 Goods consumption 
  Gradual introduction of mandatory EU-wide product labelling highlighting the 
carbon footprint.  
  Targeted advertisements for more “quality instead of quantity”  
  Targeted  information  about  the  relationship  between  production,  price,  and 
product life to foster acceptance 
  Information on sharing products and corresponding “sharing/renting/borrowing” 
services, for example as already offered by the agricultural machinery rings 
  Improved campaigns to “buy local” in order to optimise online shopping patterns 
68 
  
2.4.6.4.3 Leisure and tourism 
  Advertising for regional and sustainable holiday activities 
  Internalisation of external costs for all modes of transport, including air travel 
  Incentives to travel to and from school activities by public transportation  
  Incentives for organisers of all events to ensure that attendees come with public 
transportation

2.4.7  Digitalisation and innovation 
2.4.7.1  Digitalisation 
Digitalisation will play a key role in a climate-neutral economy. Digital technologies can 
especially  lead  to  energy  and  emission  savings  by  increasing  efficiency,  integrating 
renewables,  and  by  better  matching  demand  and  supply.  However,  the  high  energy 
consumption of the growing ICT sector harbours its own challenges, hence, powering it entirely 
with renewable electricity is essential.  
  
Examples of contributions from digitalisation: 
o  Smart grids: more efficient electricity management, smart metering, sector coupling; 
demand side management (DSM): one and the same actor is sometimes a consumer 
and sometimes a producer of energy (electricity, heat). 
o  Smart transport systems, autonomous driving: improved traffic flow, optimised driver 
behaviour and routing, new mobility offerings:  
o  integrated platforms for multi-modal mobility: “on the go” from the local to the 
national level 
o  sharing platforms 
o  optimised logistics/smart delivery traffic 
o  smart land use and mobility planning 
69 
  
o  Smart buildings: higher energy efficiency in buildings and neighbourhoods through 
automation 
o  Precision farming: optimised agriculture with low energy input, more efficient fertiliser, 
pesticide, and herbicide use, irrigation 
o  Greater efficiency in industrial manufacturing processes (Industry 4.0, 3D printing) 
o  Efficient robotics 
o  Efficient production, less production of scrap 
o  Green ICT: Reduced energy consumption through more efficient equipment 
o  Contribution to raising awareness for climate-friendly consumption: footprints and 
information via apps 
o  Open  innovation  and  open  source,  commons  oriented,  improved  information 
exchange “without borders”: Digital tools allow new ways of communication, facilitate 
decentralised organisations, and make regional and local production more attractive 
and cheaper. 
Ecological and social aspects must also be taken into account in the digitalisation strategies 
from the outset so that its potential is realised in full and not eroded by rebound effects which 
in turn cause greater energy consumption and emissions; these aspects include:  
  Taking climate targets and sustainability into account in digitalisation strategies  
  Strengthening standards for climate-friendly procurement in the ICT sector 
  Life cycle view of products and the corresponding requirements for product design and 
ease of repair 
Further  prerequisites  for  climate-friendly  digitalisation  are  social  acceptance  (especially 
relating to the use of information about consumers in accordance with the data protection 
regulations) and availability and accessibility for all population groups. 
2.4.7.2  Innovation 
Innovations will also be needed to ensure long-term decarbonisation of our economic 
system. To this end, the BMNT funds demonstration projects of companies presenting 
innovative technologies that are on the verge of market maturity and that contribute to 
achieving quantifiable environmental effects through the UFI domestic environmental 
investment funding programme. The programmes of the Climate and Energy Fund also 
cover innovation process from basic research to demonstration. Other federal ministries, 
especially the BMDW and BMVIT, also run innovative programmes such as COMET, VOIN, 
and Eurstars that show strong orientation towards sustainability, efficient resource use, 
new environmentally friendly product solutions, and green innovations.   
70 
  
At  the  EU  level,  the  research  landscape  is  currently  being  restructured  through 
programmes such as Horizon Europe (the successor to Horizon2020). The EU Innovation 
Fund  will  promote  demonstration  projects  for  innovative  technologies  and  ground-
breaking industrial developments for reducing CO  emissions from 2020 to 2030. A new 
2
feature of Horizon Europe is that research questions are accompanied by mission areas 
that  describe  clear  social  challenges.  We  especially  expect  the  implementation  of 
measures for the mission areas defined at the EU level by no later than 2050, in part 
through support at the Member State level.  
  Mission area 1: Adaptation to climate change, including societal transformation  
  Mission area 2: Cancer  
  Mission area 3: Healthy oceans, seas, and coastal and inland waters  
  Mission area 4: Climate-neutral and smart cities  
  Mission area 5: Soil health and food

3  FINANCING 
3.1  Estimation of the required investments 
According to the 1.5°C report of the IPCC, the average additional investments in energy-
related reduction measures in pathways that reduce global warming to 1.5°C will amount to 
around 830 billion USD 2010 per year for the period from 2016 to 2050 compared with 
investments without new climate policies beyond those in force today (range from 150 to 1700 
billion USD 2010 over six models). This stands in comparison to average total energy supply 
investments in 1.5°C pathways of 1460 to 3510 billion USD 2010 per year and total average 
energy-related investments on the demand side of 640 to 910 billion USD 2010 per year in the 
period from 2016 to 2050. Total energy-related investments are increasing in 1.5°C pathways 
compared to 2°C pathways by around 12% (range from 3 to 24%). The average annual 
investments in low-carbon energy technologies and energy efficiency will increase by around 
a factor of 6 by 2050 compared with 2015. 
According to the European long-term strategy, the modernisation and decarbonisation of the 
EU economy will mobilise large volumes of additional investments. Around 2% of GDP are 
currently being invested in our energy system and the related infrastructure. This share would 
have to be increased to 2.8% (or around EUR 520 to 575 billion) in the EU in order to enable an 
economy with zero net greenhouse gas emissions. This implies very substantial additional 
investments of up to EUR 175 to 290 billion per year compared to the baseline.  
Based on models for the national energy and climate plan and scenario extrapolations until 
2050, scientific analyses were commissioned to estimate the required investments in Austria 
on a sectoral basis and also to explore potential for innovative financing instruments. Results 
will be available at some point in 2020. 
Achieving the goal of climate neutrality will entail considerable investments that must include 
contributions from governments (federal, provincial, EU) and the private sector in accordance 
with the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement (especially Article 2.1 [c]). It is important 
to reconcile financial flows with a development that is low in greenhouse gas emissions and 
resilient to climate change. The auctioning of certificates in the EU emissions trading system 
generates income for Member States which can be a key source for the financing of climate 
action measures. This is also specified in the EU Emissions Trading Directive. The expected 
total investment volume for reaching the objective will ultimately depend on the assumed 
combination of regulatory, funding, and tax policy measures. The cost-effectiveness of the 
72 
  
climate and energy funding landscape will be just as important in driving investment as the 
expected effects of new regulatory requirements and/or the effectiveness of new green finance 
instruments.  Regulatory  measures  in  particular  need  not  necessarily  or  directly  trigger 
investment-relevant financial flows, but can also constitute directly relevant contributions to 
meeting the objectives of the Energy Union.   
A key factor in achieving net zero emissions by 2050 will be mobilising private capital and 
directing financial flows towards a low-emission economy and society. Financing of necessary 
investments  with  public  funds  alone  will  not  be  sufficient.  Consequently,  we  will  need 
additional  incentives  and  instruments  to  leverage  private  capital  and  strengthen  the 
contribution of financial markets to reaching the long-term climate and energy targets.  
The Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Ministry for Sustainability and Tourism set up 
a Focal Group Green Finance in February 2019. As part of the action plan of the European 
Commission for the financing of sustainable growth from 8 March 2018, an Austrian Green 
Finance Agenda will be developed in collaboration with key financial market participants in 
order to establish Austria as a robust green financial centre. The continuation and extension of 
this collaboration between public and private institutions is under consideration, so that long-
term pathways and related measures will be discussed and jointly defined with financial market 
actors.  
The dialogue between government agencies and market actors is a key instrument for ensuring 
the practicality and feasibility of public measures for the mobilisation of private capital and for 
financing the net zero emission goal. In a changing environment, it is extremely important to 
ensure a meaningful exchange between relevant actors as we move forward. The volatility of 
the market must be reduced via a stable long-term legal framework in order to facilitate 
investments which must be financed and implemented over the long term. To this end, existing 
legal impediments to the financing of zero-emission economic activities should be reviewed in 
detail  and  eliminated  by  taking  other  relevant  interests  into  account.  A  common 
understanding of such activity will require uniform methods and standards to overcome 
language  barriers  between  the  financial  and  real  economy.  Their  development  and 
implementation will strongly contribute to an increase in the volume of sustainable activity. It 
will be particularly important to also account for the SME-oriented structure of the Austrian 
economy, which will require the development and refinement of instruments in order to 
mobilise private capital. Interfaces with projects at regional and local level must be considered 
for comprehensive financing to stimulate the private market.  
Measures to be implemented immediately that will have long-term effects pertain to: 
  the integration of fore-sighted climate risk management into  economic practice 
73 
  
  improved transparency and data on the influence of economic activities on climate 
change, 
  the promotion of long-term thinking in capital markets, 
  structured awareness-raising in the financial sector for customers and advisers. 
3.2  Awareness-raising in financial markets 
Increased awareness of the relationship between financial market activities and climate-
relevant effects will be highly important in achieving zero net emissions by 2050, meaning that 
such soft measures are also a key part of the implementation toolkit. A central element is 
raising awareness for green finance, starting with customer advisers who manage and sell local 
financial products up to the establishment of expertise in companies as to how green financial 
instruments can be designed and positioned on the market. This requires a definition of 
standards and rules for green financial products and a further development of this framework 
on the basis of the European Commission’s action plan for the financing of sustainable growth.  
At the same time, customers and investors must evaluate such products and must be informed 
about existing rules and standards. A key aspect is the communication of sustainable and green 
financing models and of the impacts that financial flows have on the climate and environment.  
A constant exchange between the public administration and private investors will be important 
for achieving a transparent standard of awareness. Financial experts will need a clear legal 
framework which facilitates the operationalisation of green finance. The focal group, which 
was launched in Austria, can serve as a basis for an active dialogue in order to create 
comprehensive awareness. 
 
74 
  
4  ASSESSMENT OF SOCIO-
ECONOMIC EFFECTS 
4.1  Introduction 
Achieving net zero emissions will require comprehensive changes in society and the economy, 
in particular the avoidance of fossil fuels as an energy source to the greatest extent possible. 
Investments in durable infrastructure originally designed for fossil fuels must adapt to these 
changing uses, and a focus on sustainable technologies is also required.  
Investments in building renovation, energy-saving technologies, renewable electricity and gas 
production, and in transport infrastructure are an important source of impetus for the Austrian 
economy. These investments can be made in part by redirecting capital from other purposes 
(in  the  case  of  transport)  or  can  be  financed  through  the  provision  of  already  existing 
investment plans (power grid). In some cases investments must be supported by public funding 
or support measures. 
Cost savings (lower heating needs, less energy consumption through electric cars, etc.) 
increase disposable income, which in turn has a positive rebound effect on the economy. 
Model-based estimates at EU level and for Austria indicate positive macroeconomic effects in 
terms of economic growth and employment across all sectors. 
4.2  Just transition 
Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to climate change must also take 
social effects into account – not only because of the requirement in the Paris Agreement, but 
also because creating a framework for a socially compatible shift to a low-emission economy 
and society is a fundamental necessity. According to the preamble of the Agreement, the 
signatories are to account for the necessity of ensuring a just transition for the workforce and 
to create high-quality jobs in meeting their obligations. 
The transition to climate neutrality is not solely a technological challenge, but to a large degree 
also  an  economic,  social,  structural,  societal,  as  well  as  labour-policy  challenge.  Social 
compatibility and fairness are fundamental pillars of the overall strategy. The transformation 
75 
  
requires a far-reaching change in production and consumption patterns at the global level. The 
outsourcing of essential industrial production activities outside the EU is to be avoided.  
Changes must be made to our economy and society even if no decarbonisation takes place. 
Developments over the past decades have shown that transformation takes place through 
technological and social trends with or without political involvement, and that these trends are 
accelerating. The task of policymakers and businesses is to align the changes that will result 
from the transition to climate neutrality with the economic and social trends as effectively as 
possible and to leverage the resulting synergies. The transformation costs must be shared 
fairly to ensure the effectiveness of the transformation and to ensure social acceptance. 
The energy transformation and the shift to a zero-emission economy and society will have an 
impact on the labour market and also on available careers. But this process is nothing new. 
Professions that were common just a few years ago no longer exist (such as typesetter) 
because they are no longer needed. The general conditions in workplaces have changed 
substantially in the past. Such changes bring risks but also opportunities. Policymakers must 
ensure that this transformation has no grave negative social effects, but rather has positive or 
at least neutral effects overall. Therefore, these impacts are discussed and integrated into 
climate policy measures. 
However, a specific consideration is needed as to which changes are caused by climate policy 
and which would occur anyway due to other factors.  For example, it can be expected that 
digitization will affect many jobs, but also create new ones.  
The transformation will create opportunities for new business models, especially in the areas 
of  renewable  energy  production,  energy  efficiency,  automation  and  digitalisation, 
construction (such as building renovation, flood protection, and securing infrastructure), and 
logistics for shared and autonomous mobility, which will also create qualified jobs. However, 
for all the threats posed by the consequences of climate change, there are also opportunities 
for the labour market through adaptation measures to increase the resilience of infrastructures 
and ecosystems to climate change.  
It is not enough to simply consider emission reduction measures; just transition must also be 
viewed in the context of negative impacts of climate change and required adaptation actions. 
Water supply, agricultural production, and tourism will be impacted most significantly. The 
negative effects of climate change not only put jobs at risk, but also the prosperity and 
livelihood of everyone.  
76 
  
An in-depth analysis of the impact of the transformation and the consequences of climate 
change on jobs and social aspects is needed in order to take the necessary measures, and 
should be carried out in the coming years. Conclusions for the necessary economic, labour 
market and social policy measures can be drawn from this analysis and implementation can be 
initiated.  
Investments will be made in education and vocational training to actively address changes in 
the labour market, both financially and in terms of adapting curricula. Perpetuating training for 
jobs in endangered traditional industries endangers the livelihoods of trainees in the long term; 
new occupational profiles are emerging, to which education and training must respond in a 
timely manner. Qualification for the jobs that will be important in the transformation is not 
only crucial for the workforce, but also for the economy so that new requirements can be met 
in good time.  
77 
  
5  GOVERNANCE 
5.1  The objective 
Austria is committed to becoming climate neutral by no later than 2050. The decision, whether 
this goal shall be legally binding, is to be taken by the federal decision makers.  
5.2  Implementation of the strategy 
A strategy laid out over a period of 30 years must be reviewed and updated on a regular basis 
to ensure that the transformation process can adapt to changing conditions and that measures 
that are no longer relevant or possibly even counterproductive in a changed world are not 
perpetuated.  
Coherence with short-term action plans and the climate and energy strategy for reaching the 
2030 targets will be ensured. These may not contain any measures that run counter to or slow 
the implementation of the transformation; lock-in effects of technologies and regulations that 
contradict the strategy must be identified and corrected in good time. 
Legal projects at the federal and provincial level are to be subject to a mandatory climate 
review in order to prevent undesired adverse effects on the climate.  
The progress made in the implementation of the strategy must be monitored continuously to 
ensure that the trajectory is correct. Key indicators are the development of greenhouse gas 
emissions  as  documented  for  the  BMNT  by  the  Federal  Environment  Agency  in  the 
Greenhouse Gas Inventory and energy statistics such as energy consumption and the share of 
renewable energy in the gross final energy use as recorded by Statistics Austria.  
5.3  Involvement of the scientific community 
The implementation of the long-term climate strategy 2050 and the regular evaluation and 
updates require scientific backing from a number of disciplines. So far, this advice has been 
obtained mainly from the fields of economics, technology, and natural sciences (climatology, 
biology, agriculture and forestry); however, expertise is also needed from the fields of social 
78 
  
sciences (including sociology, political sciences, and psychology) to assess the social impact of 
the strategy, to adequately address the concerns, fears, and expectations of citizens, and to 
discuss how these concerns can best be integrated. 
For example, an independent advisory committee with scientists from the above-mentioned 
disciplines could be set up to ensure the involvement of these sciences over the long term.  
It is the responsibility of policy makers to evaluate the inputs from science and make the 
relevant decisions on the basis of the available information.  
5.4  Involvement of the private sector and workers  
Plans  are  in  place  to  involve  further  stakeholder  groups  in  the  process  to  ensure  high 
acceptance and to find the best solutions. This especially pertains to businesses and the 
workforce  to  adequately  address  the  challenges  of  a  changing  business  and  working 
environment. The public sector will not be able to carry many of the necessary investments. 
New business models must be developed, and a coherent financing strategy, which is not only 
based on public budgets but primarily on the sustainability of financial flows of companies and 
that offers the necessary framework and incentives, is crucial.  
Separate  instruments  will  be  developed  to  incorporate  the  knowledge  and  innovative 
capabilities of these actors.   
5.5  Public participation 
A successful transformation will not be possible without support for the strategy from citizens 
and their involvement in its implementation. This means that addressing the concerns of civil 
society is crucial for laying a strong foundation for the transformation.  
Public involvement should  
•  promote the exchange of information and experiences, 
•  promote an understanding of other opinions and a balancing of interests, 
•  increase the quality and transparency of decisions, 
•  increase acceptance and clarity of decisions, including decisions that will not have 
social benefits until later, 
•  increase the degree to which citizens and interest groups identify with decisions and 
with their environment,   
79 
  
•  strengthen trust in the political system and public administration and offer a broad base 
for decisions by political and administrative actors, 
•  provide broad access for opinion forming, 
•  avoid  delays  and  additional  costs  in  the  implementation  of  the  policies,  plans, 
programmes, and laws and, thus, optimise resource use.34 
Citizens shall be able to increasingly contribute their knowledge to climate policy. Therefore, 
a more objective, constructive and solution-oriented approach to the topic is needed. 
Technical possibilities that go far beyond the transmission of comments by e-mail are also 
available for this purpose - depending on the purpose pursued - information dissemination, 
collection of opinions, discussion platform, factual inputs, etc. - different instruments are more 
or less well suited for this purpose. The specific instruments must be selected on a case-by-
case basis.

6.1.1  Energy and greenhouse gas scenarios 
The following models and contributions from the respective institutions were used to calculate 
the scenarios “with existing measures” and “transition”:  
  CESAR/WIFO  (Center of Economic Scenario Analysis and Research and Austrian 
Institute  of  Economic  Research)  –  Dynamic  New  Keynesian  Model  (DYNK); 
socioeconomic parameters and effects, conversion and final energy use.  
  IVT (Institute for Internal Combustion Engines and Thermodynamics at the Graz 
University of Technology) – NEMO model, KEX module, GEORG; energy consumption 
and emissions of the transport sector (including off road).  
  IVV (Institute for Transport Studies at the Vienna University of Technology) – MARS 
model; traffic volumes and modal split.  
  EEG/e-think (Energy Economics Group of the Vienna University of Technology) – 
energy prices, INVERT/EE-Lab model; cooling, space heating, and water heating 
including electricity demand for households and services, district heating demand.  
  AEA (Austrian Energy Agency) – electricity import price, model based on TIMES; public 
electricity and district heating generation.  
  Federal Environment Agency – iron and steel industry; waste generation, alternative 
fuels, electro mobility, industrial sectors and self-producers of electricity, compressor 
stations, complete overviews, project coordination.  
 
The transition scenario was based on the following socioeconomic assumptions (2017/2019):

Population growth was taken from the primary variant of the Statistics Austria projection from 
2016. The international energy prices were estimated based on the assumption that noise, 
emissions,  radiation,  traffic  safety,  resource  procurement,  landscape  damage,  and  the 
respective subsequent effects will be included in the prices of energy sources. This pertains to 
the generation in the country of origin, as well as transit, and use in the destination country. 
Through this altered policy prices for fossil fuels will rise despite falling global demand. 
Economic growth until 2050 was assumed to be on average 1.7% p.a. 
The transition scenario was updated by the Federal Environment Agency in the second half of 
2019 for the purposes of the Austrian long-term strategy; the key data (especially energy and 
greenhouse gases) on which the scenario is based were updated (2017). 
 
 
82 
  
6.1.2  More detailed description of selected pathways35 
 
Further analyses for the evaluation of natural sinks were conducted in the CareForParis project. 
The project is in finalisation as of the end of 2019. Once the final results are available, the 
scenarios below may be updated on the basis of the latest findings.  
Pathway A “Transition – renewables, efficiency, lifestyle” 
A pathway titled “transition” was defined as a benchmark scenario and corresponds to the 
fundamental assumptions and results of the model-based scenario transition from 2019. It is 
based  on  an  extensive  expansion  of  renewable  energy  sources  for  electricity  and  heat 
generation and a high degree of efficiency in the sectors of transport, buildings/services, and 
industry. The majority of renewable energy will be generated domestically, and imports of 
bioenergy will remain approximately at the current level. Changes in consumer behaviour will 
lead to reduced need for mobility, a strongly dampened increase in transport volumes, 
decreased waste generation, and substantially lower meat production. 
This will bring a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 80% compared with 1990 levels by 
2050. The pathway calculator permits further improvements towards the target of net zero 
emissions by 2050. Carbon is sequestered in natural sinks by selecting a forestry reference 
scenario (-4 million tonnes of CO ), and the domestic production of agricultural bioenergy will 
2
be expanded further. The option of carbon capture from industrial incineration processes and 
power plants is selected (close to 9 million tonnes of CO  in 2050) in order to compensate for 
2
the remaining greenhouse gas emissions (fossil fuel use, industrial processes, agriculture).  
                                                                 
35 The pathways depict “what would happen if” situations for which no political decisions have yet been made. 
83 
  
 
 
Figure4 Pathway A “Transition – renewables, efficiency, lifestyle” 
Pathway B “Bioenergy/hydrogen imports and carbon capture” 
This pathway is based on the decision to implement an ambitious expansion of renewable 
energy (electricity and heat from wind, photovoltaics/solar thermal, geothermal energy, 
biomass) in Austria, but does not fully exploit the technically and economically feasible limits 
as in pathway A (except for bioenergy). It is also based on a relatively smaller change in 
84 
  
consumption and production patterns (passenger traffic levels remain roughly constant, 
freight traffic rises considerably). The changes in the building sector are also not as profound 
as in pathway A. Hydrogen plays a major role in transport, industry, and heating generation. 
The demand for hydrogen is largely covered by imports. The gap in achieving the objective 
(zero net emissions) is covered by carbon capture from industry and power plants as well as 
geological storage (CCS) or by material utilisation (CCU). 
 
Figure 5 Pathway B “Bioenergy/hydrogen imports and carbon capture” 
 
85 
  
Pathway C “Bioenergy/hydrogen production in Austria and CCS/CCU” 
This pathway intentionally avoids the import of bioenergy and hydrogen. The demand for 
hydrogen is focused on industrial applications, especially steel production, and on freight 
traffic.  Domestic  hydrogen  production  requires  a  substantial  expansion  of  electricity 
generation capacities (similarly to pathway A). The use of bioenergy from domestic sources 
(forestry and agricultural biomass) will increase considerably. The use of energy will not 
decrease as much as in pathway A, but more than in pathway B and C. 
The high demand for forest biomass will lead to a reduction of the natural carbon sink, trending 
towards zero by 2050. Remaining greenhouse gas emissions of around 18 million tonnes of CO  
2
equivalents (from the use of combustible fuels, industrial processes, and agriculture) would 
have to be offset entirely by means of CCS or CCU in this scenario.

Figure 6 Pathway C “Bioenergy/hydrogen production in Austria and carbon capture” 
Pathway D “Bioenergy/hydrogen import and increased carbon stock in forests” 
The pathway trends in terms of energy generation and imports and in terms of structural 
changes are similar to those in pathway B, however, significantly less forest biomass will be 
used for domestic energy generation. This will enable a significant increase in forest carbon 
stocks by 2050. The expansion of the natural sink to around 12 million tonnes of CO  by 2050 
2
will allow Austria to avoid using CCS/CCU technologies. 
87 
  
However, it will not be possible to maintain this high forest sink capacity over the long term, 
beyond 2050 (see also section 6.1.3).

6.1.3  Wood value chain scenario 
•  Scenario R – Reference scenario 
The demand for wood and the corresponding logging will follow the same trend as in the past 
years. The ceteris paribus assumption for the market-regulating framework conditions and the 
behaviour of market participants until 2020 is implemented. No further policy measures with 
a steering effect will take effect in the subsequent years, but rather will wood demand be driven 
by market conditions. 
•  Scenario 1a – Increased logging because of increased energy generation 
The demand for felled wood for energy increases substantially due to the expansion of biomass 
power plants and energy transition effects. This scenario assumes that the wood harvested 
from forests for fuel use will increase to 120% of the reference level by 2100. 
•  Scenario 1b – Increased logging because of increased material use 
A higher quantity of wood will be used for materials than in the reference scenario, with the 
import availability of raw timber following expected trends. Construction with wood and the 
use of wood products will be promoted through direct funding, changes in building codes, and 
the development of new technologies that expand the possible applications of wood and thus 
lead to increased wood use in construction. Promotion of and demand for direct use of forest 
biomass for energy generation will decrease accordingly. The prices for lumber compared with 
prices for fuel wood will shift to provide a stronger incentive to forest management that 
supplies higher-quality varieties. This leads to an increase in the amount of wood for material 
use to 120% of the level in the Reference Scenario by 2100. 
•  Scenario 1c – Increased logging because of increased material use under good import 
conditions 
This assumes increased wood use compared with the reference scenario combined with higher 
availability of raw timber for import. Larger volumes of wood are available for import thanks 
to an expansion of the sourcing area for raw timber. The import availability for raw timber 
amounts to 150% of the reference level. 
•  Scenario 2 – Reduced use (restrictions on use and exclusion of forest areas from use 
through nature conservation regulations) 
89 
  
Incentive and support systems as well as framework conditions are created which, on the one 
hand, lead to a reduction in forest area under forest use and, on the other hand, to a reduction 
in the amount of use on the forest areas which continue to be managed. Such systems and 
framework  conditions  are  based  on  nature  conservation  laws  and  are  coupled  with 
corresponding  compensation  for  the  loss  of  use  and  subsidies  or  payments  for  the 
accumulation of carbon stocks in the landscape. This scenario assumes that the share of forests 
not  commercially  managed  (core  zones  of  national  and  biosphere  parks,  Dürrenstein 
wilderness area, nature preserves) will increase from currently 1% to 5% of productive forest 
area by 2100. In the forests still managed for logging, the harvest quantities calculated under 
the reference scenario for the different protected areas in 2010 will be reduced by the 
percentages in Table 3. 
Table 3: Usage reduction for scenario 2 in different protected areas. The base value is the 
regular harvest quantity of the reference scenario in the year 2010 
Protection category         by 2020   2020–2050   2050–2100  
National parks, biosphere parks  
(Peripheral zones), Natura 2000 areas   20%       30%     40%  
Other protected areas (e.g.  
landscape conservation) and  
migration corridors        10%       15%     20%  
All other commercially managed forests   5%       10%     15%  
Logging 
The harvest quantities vary between 18.8 and 27.6 million m3 depending on the scenario and 
are all above the average harvest quantities of the last five years of 17.65 million m3. The 
highest quantities are harvested in scenario 1b, which assumes increased logging due to 
increased material use. At the beginning of the simulation period, the harvest volume in the 
energy scenario (1a) is greater than in all other scenarios but then falls below scenarios 1b and 
1c starting in 2040. After 2090, the quantity harvested in the energy scenario declines abruptly 
to below the quantities in all other scenarios. This decrease is due to the fact that the required 
quantity of deciduous timber can no longer be provided. Scenario 2 has the lowest wood 
harvest quantities, where reduced utilisation is assumed due to usage restrictions and the 
retirement of forest areas from commercial management (see figure). 
 
90 
  
 
Figure 8 Estimated annual wood harvest quantities by management scenario. 
Growth 
The annual growth is shown in the figure below. With the exception of scenario 2, all scenarios 
show a slight downward trend from the beginning. It falls from 9.4 m3/ha/year in 2010 to 8.8 
m3/ha/year in the reference scenario or to 8.3 m3/ha/year in scenario 1c. In scenario 2, the 
growth until 2060 and 2070 increases to just under 10 m3/ha/year and then declines again 
somewhat until the end of the simulation period. At 9.6 m3/ha/year as of the end of the 
simulation period, the growth in scenario 2 is slightly above the initial level in 2010. 
 
91 
  
 
Figure 9 Annual forest stock growth by management scenario  
Tree varieties 
The latest forest inventory (BFW, 2018) shows that the proportion of spruce in the composition 
of tree species is declining (currently 57.4%), while deciduous tree species such as beech and 
oak are increasing. 
The development of the distribution of tree species in the different scenarios is shown in the 
following figure. The most substantial change occurs in scenario 2, where deciduous trees 
account for nearly half of the entire stock in 2100. The primary reason for the increase in the 
stock of deciduous trees is the reduced use. 
 
92 
  
 
Figure 10 Development of the tree species distribution in the different scenarios 
Development of the greenhouse gas balance 
An examination of the changes in the total carbon stock in forests(above-ground and below-
ground biomass, standing dead wood, soil carbon including lying dead wood), z which are 
relevant for the greenhouse gas balance, shows that the forest remains a sink until around 2040 
in all scenarios. The sink function is even maintained until the end of the century in scenario 2, 
though the captured quantities are very low at the end of the simulation period and the forest 
shows a tendency towards becoming a source. In the other scenarios, the forest becomes a net 
source of greenhouse gases significantly earlier, between 2040 and 2060 as the carbon sink in 
the forest decreases due to more intensive use (see the following figure).

promote private and public investments in climate action. This requires a clear definition of 
these investment options and the creation of a framework that provides investors with reliable 
information as to whether their investment is climate friendly.

Adaptation of tourism to climate change 
Description 
Tourism in the Austrian Alps is being impacted heavily by the impacts of climate change. The 
provision of consulting and support services for the development of climate-friendly and 
sustainable green tourism strategies and offerings should help winter sport regions create 
offerings that are not dependent on snowfall and should help to strengthen summer tourism 
in the Alps, for example.

Preservation of ecosystems and biodiversity 
Description 
Preserving natural ecosystems and biodiversity is crucial for our society, food supply, health, 
and economy. Increased target-group oriented public relations work and awareness-raising 
measures relating to the importance of ecosystems and biodiversity in adapting to climate 
change should promote the preservation of important functions.

6.3  Storylines for individual fields of action 
Various areas of life in 2050 are described as examples of mobility and transport habits in a 
largely decarbonised transport sector:  
A family in the countryside 
A couple (both employed) with two children (both attending school) lives in a house in a town 
with  300  inhabitants.  The  parents  have  office  jobs  in  the  next  town  and  car-pool  with 
neighbours to a co-working office using an electric car. The parents can work from home two 
days a week, which reduces the volume of traffic. The two teenagers are attending the 
secondary school in the provincial capital, which is about 25 minutes away from home. They 
make the trip by bus and train. The family takes short trips (such as shopping and running 
errands in town) on foot or with a (freight) bicycle. The family generates the electricity it needs 
to power their home and electric car with a photovoltaic system. With a storage bank of 
second-life batteries from electric cars, the family is almost autonomous in terms of their 
power supply.  
Married couple in the city 
Two adults live in a central district of a provincial capital, both are employees. The distance to 
their workplaces is only two kilometres, and they usually make the trip by bicycle. Errands are 
also done on foot or by bicycle, and the family owns no car. In 2050, it is common for people to 
form sharing communities where they own a share of an electric car fleet and reserve a vehicle 
via an app when needed. Depending on the application, you can choose from several vehicle 
models. The couple uses this option for special needs (such as moving furniture). They also use 
the app inter-modally to manage their personal mobility (booking a car sharing vehicle, car-
pooling, public transport schedules, etc.) 
 
Plumber  
A plumbing business is being run in a small town. As is the case for most trades, the focus is 
now being placed on repairing existing systems and only replacing systems when absolutely 
necessary. The plumber is also a trained energy efficiency consultant and gives her customers 
tips on how to further reduce their heating costs and on how to install their own renewable 
energy systems. The plumber uses a freight bicycle or electric car depending on the distance. 
She goes to the wholesaler twice per week to buy parts, for which she uses an electric van from 
a sharing provider. She has a photovoltaic system on the roof of the company building that 
generates  100%  of  the  electricity  she  needs  including  a  battery  storage  bank.  Modern 
technology (apps/video phones) often allow the plumber to get an idea of the work that needs 
Long-Term Strategy 2050 - Austria  122  
to be done in advance, sometimes even eliminating the need to make a trip to the customer 
(for example the preparation of a cost estimate), reducing the volume of traffic.  
 
SME  
A carpentry shop has been set up at the edge of a small provincial capital. The mobility needs 
primarily pertain to travelling between the shop and customers. Business trips are also 
undertaken to visit foresters, sawmills and for advanced vocational training. The used wood is 
sourced from surrounding forests. The finished products are transported by freight bicycle. If 
this is not possible, the company’s electric van is used. For projects outside of the region, the 
majority of the transport distance is covered by rail. Internal transport is handled by hydrogen-
powered forklifts. The company operates a photovoltaic system, and the excess electricity is 
used to run an electrolysis plant to produce hydrogen. This is used to fuel the forklifts. The 
employees from the surrounding area travel to work on the extensive network of bicycle paths. 
The shop has showers for the employees. The company provides all employees with an annual 
pass for the public transportation system. 
Large enterprise 
A steel company is the world market leader in its segment thanks to its innovative products. 
The production facility is located along a freight corridor, therefore a connecting railway was 
built. The company has a major customer to which it delivers the produced steel. This customer 
is also connected to the rail network through a connecting railway. The company has a green 
hydrogen powered fuel cell truck to make deliveries to other customers. The company and all 
business partners have modern video conferencing facilities. Most business trips are taken by 
train, as the travel time can be used to prepare for meetings with customers, for example. In 
addition to company bicycles (including e-bikes), employees can make use of electric cars for 
ride sharing. Many replacement parts can be produced with a 3D printer, reducing the need for 
physical transport. 
 
Tourist operation 
A hotel is run as a family business and is located in one of Austria’s many beautiful national 
parks. Active mobility management by the hotel itself and the town have led to sustainable 
mobility behaviour on the part of the guests. Most guests travel to and from the hotel by train. 
The hotel’s shuttle service picks up the guests at the train station, collects their luggage, and 
then takes the guests to the hotel in an electric bus (covering the last mile). At the hotel, guests 
can rent bicycles, electric bikes, and electric cars against a small fee. These offerings are used 
effectively, and the feedback is very positive. Motorised private traffic has long been banned 
in national parks, but hikers can make use of an attractive electric bus service. These buses run 
along the popular trailheads for hiking and climbing routes and in the valleys where the hotels 
are located. The hotel’s regional orientation has also strengthened the surrounding economy. 
It serves regional products from local organic farms, and makes use of well trained personnel 
123 
  
and tradespeople from the area. The hotel uses the sun and a nearby river to generate 
electricity and produces almost no non-recyclable waste as a certified zero waste company.
