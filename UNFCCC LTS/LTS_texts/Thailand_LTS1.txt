vi Preface 
Climate  change  is  perilously  affecting  all  countries  and  has  had  an  unprecedented  impact 
across  the  globe.  Past  GHG  emissions  have  led  to  many  changes  in  the  climate  system, 
including  increased  heatwave  frequency  and  intensity,  heavy  precipitation,  as  well  as 
droughts. Current and future emissions rates will likely cause additional global warming that 
will further instigate such changes with irreversible impacts.  
Recognizing  the  need  for  multilateral  cooperation  to  keep  the  global  average  temperature 
within  the  limit  of  the  Paris  Agreement’s  goal  and  guided  by  the  principles  of  common 
but  differentiated  responsibilities  and  respective  capability,  especially  in  consideration  of 
different national circumstances, Thailand hereby formulates its Long-term Low Greenhouse Gas 
Development  Strategy  (LT-LEDS)  to  guide  the  country’s  national  development  agenda 
and contribute to global efforts to address climate change. Thailand’s LEDS is science-based 
and  has  been  prepared  with  the  involvement  of  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders  to  ensure 
a  balanced  position  based  on  economic  growth,  poverty  eradication,  just  transition, 
food security, social welfare (with particular regard for vulnerable groups), and climate actions 
needed  to  mitigate  climate  change.  It  will,  therefore,  serve  as  a  basis  for  the  preparation 
of  future  NDCs  and  thus  support  Thailand’s  transition  towards  low  GHG  emissions 
and climate-resilient development.   
In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 19 of the Paris Agreement, and responding to decision 
1/CP.21,  paragraph  35  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties,  Thailand  hereby  communicates 
its  mid-century,  Long-term  Low  Greenhouse  Gas  Development  Strategy  to  the  Secretariat. 
To  achieve  the  targets  outlined  in  Thailand’s  LEDS,  stringent  GHG  mitigation  measures  are 
needed in energy, IPPU, waste and agriculture sectors, including a drastic increase of carbon sink 
and  removals  in  forestry  and  land  uses.  In  this  regard,  international  cooperation  and 
financial,  technological,  and  capacity-building  support  are  critically  important  to  support 
Thailand’s efforts to make this necessary transition towards a sustainable future.  
Although  Thailand’s  LEDS  primarily  focuses  on  GHG  mitigation,  Thailand  recognizes  that 
adaptation  and  climate  resilience  are  equally  important.  Thailand,  therefore,  looks  forward 
to  further  elaborating  its  policies  and  priorities  on  climate  change  adaptation  in  future 
communications.

1 Executive Summary 
The Paris Agreement sets out a long-term temperature goal and underscores the urgency for 
Parties to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible and to 
undertake rapid reductions thereafter, on the basis of equity and in the context of sustainable 
development and poverty eradication, while recognizing that peaking will take longer for 
developing  country  Parties.  In  this  connection,  Article  4,  paragraph  19,  of  the  Paris 
Agreement, suggests all Parties to strive to formulate and communicate long-term low 
greenhouse gas emission development strategies, mindful of Article 2 considering their 
common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different 
national circumstances. 
The mid-century, long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy (LT-LEDS) of 
Thailand was developed through a participatory process through the establishment of various 
working groups from all sectors and stakeholders before gaining the final approval by the 
Cabinet. Thailand’s LEDS set out clear targets and measures to be implemented towards 
achieving its net zero GHG emission.  First, Thailand aims to reach its peak GHG emissions in 
2030 at approximately 370 MtCO eq. Second, Thailand’s net greenhouse gas emissions are 
2
projected to be approximately 200 MtCO eq in 2050, which is consistent with the global 2-
2
degree pathway. Third, post-2050 emissions will follow the IPCC 2-degree pathways, in which 
Thailand aims to achieve the balance between GHG emissions by sources and removals by 
sinks as early as possible within the second half of this century. 
The main GHG mitigation measures identified in Thailand’s LEDS focus on the energy and 
transport  sectors.  Measures  identified  in  the  energy  sector  include  energy  efficiency 
improvement, technology switching and the adoption of renewable energy and carbon 
capture and storage (CCS). In the transport sector, mitigation measures include modal shift, 
energy efficiency improvement and the promotion of new, efficient, vehicle fleets. 
In addition, Thailand also aims to meet the carbon neutrality by 2065. As such it is expected 
that financial and technological support will be provided as early as possible. Thailand must 
prioritize and speedily develop its new infrastructure, especially the energy and transport 
system, by increasing the share of renewable electricity generation at least 50% of new power 
generation capacity by 2050 and the share of new vehicles in the market to be electric vehicles 
at least 69% by 2035. It also includes energy efficiency improvement, and adopt advanced 
carbon removal technologies, such as bio-energy with CCS, CCS and CCU. The energy system 
must be transformed through decarbonization, digitalization, decentralization, deregulation 
and electrification such as grid modernization, energy storage systems, net metering market, 
and  EV  infrastructure.  Furthermore,  it  is  foreseen  that,  the  deployment  of  hydrogen 
renewable electricity and CCS will also play a vital role in meeting the target. 
2  
 
 
It is revealed that the implementation of Thailand’s LEDS will lead to certain socio-economic 
impacts due to increasing energy system cost from greener energy production. This impact 
includes GDP and welfare losses after 2040 and large increasing carbon prices in 2050. 
Thailand needs to prepare a transitional plan for its transformation in the energy and 
transport  infrastructure  to  increase  the  low-emission  investments  and  businesses.  This 
domestic preparation, together with the expected lower costs of advanced GHG mitigation 
technologies, will mitigate such economic impacts and result in a better economy in a long 
run. Meanwhile, its co-benefit includes a decrease in energy intensity and CO2 per capita 
which will help in reducing local air pollutants such as NO , CO, NMVOC and PM2.5.  
X
A successful transition to a low-carbon society in Thailand requires the contribution of all 
sectors and stakeholders. Thailand is looking for more low-carbon business models from both 
domestic and international investors. This opportunity will enable Thailand to build forward 
better to become a green economy country after the COVID-19 pandemic and facilitate a 
move towards carbon neutrality and a net zero GHG emission, respectively. Lastly, to achieve 
Thailand's LEDS targets, international cooperation and support is needed in terms of policy 
development,  research  and  technology  development,  development  of  appropriate 
mechanisms and instruments, and capacity building.

National Circumstances
 
Climate change is among several major challenges to sustainable development. Economic 
activities  since  the  industrial  revolution  have  dramatically  accelerated  the  release  of 
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and increased the severity of climate change. Thailand 
is one of the Southeast Asia countries severely affected by climate change, especially the long-
term impacts such as increasing average temperature and increased severity and frequency 
of floods, droughts and storms. Such adverse effects jeopardize major economic sectors, 
including agriculture, tourism, and industry.  
Economic activity, population growth and urbanization contribute to the greenhouse gas 
emissions in Thailand. Despite Thailand only contributing less than one percent of the global 
greenhouse gas emissions, it has set up the goal to become a low carbon society and efforts 
have been made to shift its energy policy towards green energy over the past decade.  The 
renewable energy utilization has been greatly expanded to achieve the goal of sustainable 
green growth. 
1.1 Country Profile 
Thailand is located in a tropical area between latitudes N 5°37’ to N 20°27’ and longitudes  
E 7°22’ to E 105°37’, with a total area of 513,115 square kilometers, or approximately 200,000 
square miles. The boundaries of Thailand with adjacent areas are: North: Myanmar and Laos; 
East: Laos, Cambodia and the Gulf of Thailand; South: Malaysia; and West: Myanmar and the 
Andaman (See Figure 1-1). 
 
Figure 1-1: Map of the Kingdom of Thailand

Thailand has a coastline of approximately 2,700 km; it borders the Andaman Sea, with 865 
km of coastline. Geographically, Thailand can be divided into six regions. The northern region 
is characterized as hilly and mountainous. The north-eastern region is naturally a high plain. 
The central region is a large low-level plain. The eastern regions are mostly plains and valleys 
with some small hills. The southern region is a peninsula with the Andaman Sea on the 
western side and the South China Sea on the eastern side. Lastly, the western region is hilly 
and mountainous. 
1.1.1 Climate 
Thailand’s  climate  is  influenced  by  two  main  seasonal  monsoon  winds:  the  southwest 
monsoon and the northeast monsoon. The southwest monsoon starts in May and brings a 
stream of warm, moist air from the Indian Ocean towards Thailand, causing abundant rain 
over the country, especially on the windward side of the mountains. The northeast monsoon 
starts in October and brings cold and dry air from the anticyclone in the Chinese mainland 
over major parts of Thailand, particularly focused on the north and northeast regions. 
Thailand’s climate can be broadly divided into three seasons: 1) rainy, or the southwest 
monsoon season, from mid-May to mid-October 2) winter, or the northeast monsoon season, 
from mid-October to mid-February and 3) summer, from mid-February to mid-May. Figure 1-2 
shows the annual mean maximum temperatures in Thailand, which indicate a trend of 
increasing temperatures is likely to continue.

1.1.2 Population 
Thailand’s population is projected to gradually increase until around 2030, from which point 
it will start to decline. The forecast populations for 2025, 2030 and 2040 are 67.09, 67.14 and 
65.37 million, respectively. A decline in birth rate with a concurrent increase in life expectancy 
has shaped Thailand’s population structure into an ‘aging society’. The percentage of people 
aged 60 and over divided by people aged younger than 15 – will increase steadily. The aging 
index  will  slightly  exceed  120  before  2025,  at  which  point  Thailand  will  be  officially 
categorized as an ‘aged society’. Figure 1-3 shows that Thailand’s population is projected to 
become a ‘super aged society’ by 2035, when the aging index is estimated to exceed 200. By 
2040, the aging population will be more than double that of the youthful population. This 
transition is related to the care and support of aging members of society while the labor force 
is shrinking. 
 
 
Figure 1-3: Age structure of Thailand during 2020-2040 
 
1.1.3 Economy      
Thailand’s  economic  development  follows  the  12th  National  Economic  and  Social 
Development Plan (2017-2021), extended to 2022, which adhered to the National Strategy 
(2018-2037), a commitment to the sustainable development goals (SDGs), a philosophy of 
Sufficiency Economy, and the Thailand 4.0 Policy. Thailand has experienced low, single-digit 
GDP growth in the past decade, with the industrial and service sectors the main drivers of 
recent growth. Thailand has the second-largest economy in Southeast Asia, but its GDP per 
capita ranks fourth. The economy is heavily export-dependent, with exports accounting for 
more than one-third of GDP. Both exports and imports have faced negative growth over the 
past few years. Thailand has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the world, at about 
1%, because a large proportion of the population works in subsistence agriculture or other 
vulnerable occupations.  
6 
    
 
 
Thailand’s economy shrunk by 6.1% in 2020 due to the Coronavirus pandemic, down from 
2.3% growth the previous year, which was the lowest expansion rate in the past 10 years. 
Export value decreased by 6.6% while private consumption and total investment decreased 
by 1.0% and 4.8%, respectively (see Table 1-1). However, in the long run when the Coronavirus 
pandemic is over, it is expected that the economic growth would follow the same trend.

1.1.4 Natural Resources 
Thailand has a total land area of approximately 513,115 km2. As of 2018, 46.54% of the 
nation’s total land area (or 238,791 km2) was categorized as agricultural land. Forest land and 
non-agricultural land accounted for 31.96% and 21.50% of the total land area, respectively. 
Nearly half the agricultural land is attributed to paddy land, equal to 109,949 km2 or 21.43% 
of Thailand’s total land area. 
According to the estimation by the Royal Forest Department, forest area in 2018 was almost 
164,000 km2, which is equivalent to 16.40 million hectares. There are a number of laws in 
place in Thailand related to the management and maintenance of the national forest estate, 
such as the Royal Forest Department Strategy (2017-2036), Forest Act, B.E.2484 (1941), 
National Park Act B.E. 2562 (2019), National Reserved Forest Act, B.E.2507 (1964), Wild 
Animal Conservation and Protection Act B.E. 2562 (2019), Forest Plantation Act B.E. 2535 
(1992) and its amendment, Chain Saws Act B.E. 2545 (2002), and Community Forest Act B.E. 
2562 (2019). In addition,  a range of projects and programmes have also been implemented 
to solve issues surrounding forest loss, including activities related to Reducing Emissions from 
Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).

1.1.5 State of the Environment 
• 
Air Quality 
The five major air pollutants in Thailand are sulphur dioxide (SO ), nitrogen dioxide (NO ), 
2 2
carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O ) and particulate matter (PM). PM10 is generated by building 
3
and road construction while SO  mainly comes from industrial activities. Air pollution in 
2
Thailand can be attributed to two main sources: 1) meteorological factors during the dry 
season, and 2) point source pollution. To address this problem, the Royal Thai Government 
has formulated the 20-Year Master Plan on Air Quality Management (2018-2037), set up 
standards for atmospheric air quality and emissions from specific sources of origin, and 
developed a national air quality reporting system for communicating information in order to 
improve air quality.  
• Water Quality 
Thailand’s overall surface water quality was improved in 2018, remaining within ‘fair’ and 
‘good’ quality ranges. Some water resources decreased in quality, mostly in estuaries in 
central Thailand, where municipal, industrial and agricultural waste are concentrated. The 
outcome of water quality testing of the country’s 59 major rivers and 6 standing water sources 
showed results of ‘good’, ‘fair’ and ‘poor’ water quality indices in the proportion of 46%, 45% 
and 9%, respectively. Water quality monitoring in 64 provinces revealed 27 provinces (42%) 
with good quality, 29 provinces (45%) with fair quality and 8 provinces (13%) with poor 
quality. Thailand has formulated the 20-Year National Water Quality Management Plan (2018-
2037), which prioritizes controlling wastewater discharge to natural water resources.  
• 
Waste 
The amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) generated in 2020 was 25.37 million tons; this is 
an 11.63% decrease from 2019, and is mainly a result of expanding urban communities and 
the shift from agricultural to urban society (See Figure 1-4). The volume of household 
hazardous waste generated in 2018 was 638,000 tons or a 3.2% increase from 2017. Around 
65% of this hazardous waste (414,600 tons) was Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment 
(WEEE), with the remaining 35% (223,400 tons) consisting of other household hazardous 
waste, such as batteries, dry cell batteries, chemical containers and spray bottles.

The amount of industrial waste managed by an appropriate treatment in 2018 was 17.51 
million tons, which decreased 33% from 2017. From that total amount, 20.82 million tons is 
non-hazardous industrial waste, of which 7.2 million tons were used as fuel to generate 
electric power, and 1.2 million tons were hazardous industrial waste. The 20-Year Strategic 
Plan on Pollution Management (2017-2036) was formulated to provide a framework to 
achieve sustainable waste management and a low-carbon society by 2036. In addition, the 
National Master Plan for Waste Management (2016-2021) has been adopted as a guideline 
for solid and hazardous waste management. 
1.1.6 Energy Situation  
• 
Energy Consumption 
 
In 2020, most of the energy consumption was for commercial use, amounting to 66,821 
ktoe (86.40% of total). Among the energy sources, petroleum products accounted for the 
largest proportion of consumption (48.00%), followed by electricity (21.67%), natural gas 
(6.40%), and coal and coal products (10.32%) (See Figure 1-5).

• 
Alternative Energy 
Thailand’s alternative energy consumption continued to increase between 2016 and 2018 
(See  Table  1-3).  By  2018,  Thailand’s  alternative  energy  consumption  was  12,996  ktoe, 
representing an increase of 10.78% from the previous year. Alternative energy consumption 
from electricity, heat, and biofuel (ethanol and biodiesel) accounted for 15.48% of the total 
final energy consumption. The total electricity consumption from electrical alternative energy 
sources, including solar, wind, hydroelectricity, biomass, MSW and biogas in 2018 was 2,960 
ktoe, while consumption for heat sources such as solar, biomass, MSW and biogas was 7,919 
ktoe. Biofuel consumption was 2,117 ktoe, which constituted 781 ktoe from ethanol and 
1,336 ktoe from biodiesel. Thailand has formulated the Alternative Energy Development Plan 
(AEDP) 2018 and an AEDP action plan aiming to promote alternative energy and reduce 
11 
    
 
 
dependency on energy imports such as oil and natural gas. The overall goal of this plan is to 
increase the share of renewable energy consumption to 30% by 2037.

Energy Efficiency 
Thailand has formulated the Energy Efficiency Plan (EEP) 2018 and an EE action plan aiming 
to promote its energy efficiency. The EEP2018 specifies a target of 30% energy intensity 
reduction by 2037 and aims to conserve 54,371 ktoe by the end of the plan from all demand 
side sectors (See Figure 1-7). The industrial sector is the major contributor, accounting for 
more than 40 percent of the energy conservation target. This sector is expected to conserve 
energy  amounting  to  49,064  ktoe.  The  transport,  commercial/government  buildings, 
residence, and agriculture sectors are expected to conserve energy 17,682 ktoe, 21,167 ktoe, 
6,418 ktoe, 3,300 ktoe and 527 ktoe, respectively, by 2037 (Table 1-4).

1.2 National GHG Emissions Profile 
1.2.1 Overview of Historical Emissions 
Thailand has continued to track GHG emissions, the six main types of which (carbon dioxide, 
methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride) are 
required  to  be  reported  according  to  the  UNFCCC.  In  December  2020,  the  national 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reported in the third BUR of Thailand have been made in 
accordance with 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The total 
GHG emissions in 2016 (excluding those from LULUCF) were 354,357.61 GgCO  and net GHG 
2eq
emissions were 263,223.46 GgCO  (including those from LULUCF). In 2016, the Energy sector 
2eq
was the largest contributor to Thailand’s GHG emission, accounting for 71.65% of total GHG 
emissions, while emissions from the Agriculture, IPPU and Waste sectors accounted for 
14.72%, 8.90% and 4.73%, respectively. The LULUCF sector contributed to a net removal of 
91,134.15 GgCO , showing a trend of increased net removals as total removals exceeded 
2eq
13 
    
 
 
total emissions. In the global perspective, Thailand’s GHG emissions represent less than 1% 
of global emissions and are lower than the world average. Figure 1-8 shows the trend of GHG 
emissions.

Net  GHG  emissions  therefore  increased  overall  from  183,796.37  GgCO eq  in  2000  to 
2
263,223.46 GgCO eq in 2016, with an average annual increase of 2.27%. From 2000-2016, the 
2
main source of GHG emissions was the Energy sector, which saw an increase of 53.74% from 
165,143.84  GgCO eq  in  2000  to  253,895.61  GgCO eq  in  2016.  The  proportion of  GHG 
2 2
emissions in the Energy sector accounted for 67.20% of total emission sources in 2000, 
increasing to 71.65% of total emission sources in 2016. In the same period, the share of 
emissions from the Agriculture sector decreased from 19.93% in 2000 to 14.72% in 2016, 
while the share of emissions from the IPPU and Waste sectors remained constant (See Figure 1-9).

• 
Energy 
Total direct GHG emissions from the Energy sector in 2016 were estimated to be 253,895.61 
GgCO eq. The majority of GHG emissions in the Energy sector were generated by fuel 
2
combustion, consisting mostly of grid-connected electricity and heat production at around 
108,238.60 GgCO eq (42.84%). GHG emissions from Transport, Manufacturing Industries and 
2
Construction, and other sectors were 68,260.17 GgCO eq (27.21%), 49,538.34 GgCO eq 
2 2
(19.53%)  and  16,993.90  GgCO eq  (6.10%),  respectively.  Fugitive  Emissions  from  fuel 
2
comprised only 10,864.61 GgCO eq or a little over 4.33% of total GHG emissions from the 
2
Energy sector. Details of GHG emissions in the Energy sector by gas type and source in 2016 
are presented in Figure 1-10.

Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) 
The estimation of GHGs for the IPPU sector covered all gases indicated in the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines, with the exception of the Fluorinated (F)-gases inventory due to a limitation on 
available activity data. Total direct GHG emissions from the IPPU  sector in 2016 were 
estimated to be 31,531.41 GgCO eq. The majority of GHG emissions in this sector were 
2
attributed to mineral production, which accounted for approximately 18,968.93 GgCO eq 
2
(60.16%). GHG emissions from the chemical industry, metal production and non-energy 
products were estimated at 11,970.64 GgCO eq (37.96%), 296.65 GgCO eq (0.94%) and 
2 2
295.19 GgCO eq (0.94%), respectively. Details of direct and indirect GHG emissions in the

Agriculture 
Total GHG emissions from the Agriculture sector in 2016 were 52,158.70 GgCO eq. Livestock 
2
contributed  11,195.20  GgCO eq  (21.46%),  comprising  8,477.89  GgCO eq  from  enteric 
2 2
fermentation, and 2,201.47 and 515.84 GgCO eq for direct and indirect manure management, 
2
respectively. Meanwhile, crop-related GHG emissions accounted for 40,963.49 GgCO eq 
2
(78.54%). Rice cultivation was the main GHG contributor in Thailand’s Agriculture sector, at 
26,639.52 GgCO eq (51.07%). Agricultural soils emitted 11,473.92 GgCO eq (22.00%), with 
2 2
direct and indirect emissions contributing 8,425.98 and 3,047.94 GgCO eq, respectively. Field 
2
burning of agricultural residues and urea fertilizer contributed similar GHG emissions of 
1,303.12 and 1,517.01 GgCO eq (2.50% and 2.91%), respectively. Details of GHG emissions 
2
are presented in Figure 1-12.

Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) 
The GHG emissions and sinks from LULUCF sector were estimated using the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines  for  three  land  categories:  forest  land,  cropland,  and  other  land.  Total  CO  
2
emissions/removals from Carbon (C) stock changes for each land use category was calculated 
based on the sum of each subcategory, taking into account three carbon pools: 1) above 
ground biomass, 2) below ground biomass, and 3) dead organic matter (deadwood and litter). 
The LULUCF sector in Thailand showed a trend of increased net removals as total removals 
exceeded  total  emissions.  Croplands,  therefore,  dominated  net  removal  estimates  for 
Thailand’s LULUCF sector. Details of GHG emissions/removals in LULUCF sector in 2016 are 
presented in Figure 1-13.

• 
Waste 
Total direct GHG emissions from the Waste sector in 2016 were estimated to be 16,771.89 
GgCO . GHG emissions in the Waste sector were mainly from wastewater treatment and 
2eq
discharge, at an estimated 8,310.24 GgCO  (49.55%), and solid waste disposal, at 8,139.72 
2eq
GgCO  (48.53%). The waste incineration accounted for 244.21 GgCO  (1.46%), while the 
2eq 2eq
biological treatment of solid waste was estimated at 77.72 GgCO  (0.46%). Details of GHG 
2eq
emissions in the Waste sector in 2016, are presented in Figure 1-14. 
 
Source: Thailand Third Biennial Update Report, UNFCCC 2020. 
Figure 1-14 GHG emissions in the Waste sector in 2016 
It is clear that the drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is not just an environmental 
concern, but should also integrate agencies involved in economic and social development. 
The campaign must also attach importance to the energy and transport sectors, especially 
with regard to electricity generation and fuel combustion in the transport sector. The use of 
energy from fuel combustion and industrial electricity use, including at the household level, 
is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. The energy and transport sectors form the 
basis for many forms of development, such as improving manufacturing industries and 
services that produce lower amounts of carbon, adapting economic structures so that they 
are more environmentally friendly, and creating sustainable low-carbon cities, among others. 
Therefore, it is imperative to moderate the structure of the energy and transportation 
industry to ensure low-carbon release and environmental friendliness in the near future. 
Otherwise, it will take a long time to implement the changes and the long-term impact on the 
country's  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Due  to  the  systematic  nature  of  reporting  and 
information collection, the energy and transportation sectors are sources of large amounts of 
emissions. The long-term plans should benefit the public in reducing GHG emissions by, for 
example, creating stability in the energy sector, saving time and increasing convenience in 
travel, and reducing air pollution to improve public health.

1.3 Thailand’s Climate Change Policy and Institutional Arrangement  
Global cooperation is needed to tackle climate change. The United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is a fundamental and most important international 
framework to address climate change. Thailand became a Party to UNFCCC in 1991, and 
ratified its Kyoto Protocol in 2002 and its Paris agreement in 2016. 
To effectively address the threat of climate change to Thailand’s economy and society and in 
response to the implementation of relevant provisions under UNFCCC, Thailand has gradually 
formulated and developed its climate change strategies, policies, plans and institutional 
arrangement. The first National Strategic Plan on Climate Change (2008-2013) was developed, 
in  which  the  cabinet  directed  all  government  departments  and  agencies  to  take  into 
consideration  such  strategy  in  their  policies  and  planning.  The  most  important  policy 
framework for climate change in Thailand at the moment is the Climate Change Master Plan 
2558-2593 B.E. (2015-2050), which aims to set a long-term direction that related agencies 
and sectors can use to guide the development of plans of action in their respective areas.  
In addition, issues under the Climate Change Master Plan have been integrated into the National 
Strategy (2018-2037), which will guide a national policy framework in the next 20 years. 
1.3.1 Thailand’s Climate Change Master Plan (2015-2050)  
Thailand’s Climate Change Master Plan (2015-2050) (ONEP, 2015) aims to aid Thailand in 
achieving its sustainable development and low carbon growth and climate change resilience by 
2050. It consists of three key strategies: (i) Climate Change Adaptation,  which aims to build 
climate resilience by integrating policies and measures in all sectors, (ii) Mitigation and Low 
Carbon Development, which facilitates the development of mechanisms for GHG emissions 
reduction and leads to sustainable low carbon growth, and (iii) Enabling Environment for 
Climate  Change  Management  which  desires  to  build  capacity  for  climate  change 
implementation  by  enhancing  potential  and  awareness  of  stakeholders  and  developing 
database, knowledge, and technology to support climate change adaptation and mitigation. 
Thailand’s climate actions are divided into short-term, medium-term and long-term targets 
up to 2050. For the mitigation actions, short-term targets include: (i) develop medium- and 
long-term GHG emission reduction targets and prepare roadmaps for the implementation by 
sector, including the GHG emission reduction target on a voluntary basis (pre-2020 target), 
Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) roadmaps, and measurement, reporting, 
and verification mechanisms, (ii) establish domestic incentive mechanisms to encourage low 
carbon development. The medium-term targets include: (i) reduce GHG emissions from 
energy and transport sectors by 7-20% against BAU level by 2020, subject to the level of 
international support, (ii) supply at least 25% of energy consumption from renewable energy 
sources by 2021 and (iii) increase the ratio of municipalities with more than 10 m2 of green 
space per capita. The long-term targets include: (i) reduce energy intensity by at least 30% 
by 2036 compared to a business as usual scenario, (ii) increase use of public transportation 
19 
    
 
 
services, (iii) reduce GHG emissions from land transport, (iv) increase investment in low 
carbon and environmental friendly industries, (v) reduce open waste dumping areas, (vi) 
reduce open biomass burning, (vii) increase organic and GAP-certified farming and (viii) 
reduce GHG emissions per GDP. 
At the moment, Thailand is in the process of revising its Climate Change Master Plan to be in 
line with the current circumstances and to take into account the efforts undertaken in 
implementing the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. 
1.3.2 Existing Institutional Arrangement 
The National Committee on Climate Change Policy (NCCC) was established in 2007 as the main 
decision-making body for climate change management in Thailand. The NCCC is chaired by 
the Prime Minister and consists of members representing relevant agencies from both public 
and private sectors, experts and relevant stakeholders. The key responsibilities of the NCCC 
include the formulation of national climate policies and the establishment of guidelines and 
mechanisms for international collaboration on climate change.  
Five subcommittees are established under the NCCC, namely (1) Subcommittee on Climate 
Change Policy and Planning Integration, (2) Subcommittee on Climate Change Knowledge and 
Database, (3) Subcommittee on Climate Change Negotiation and International Cooperation, 
(4)  Subcommittee  on  Public  Relations  and  Actions  for  Climate  Empowerment  and  (5) 
Subcommittee  on  Climate  Law.  Figure  1-15  shows  the  institutional  arrangements  of 
Thailand’s NCCC.

To effectively implement, monitor, report and verify greenhouse gas emission reduction, 
Thailand has developed the domestic Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system 
at both national and sectoral levels (See Figure 1-16):

Chapter 2 
Thailand’s Mitigation Actions 
Being among of the top 10 countries most vulnerable to climate risk, Thailand has placed 
climate change on its national agenda and taken proactive steps to address this urgent threat.  
Climate change has been integrated and embedded into development policies, strategies and 
plans across sectors and at all levels.  Climate change has been incorporated into Thailand’s 
national economic and social development plans since 2007. Climate change is currently 
addressed at the highest policy level under the National Strategy (2018-2037) to ensure a 
long-term continuity of sustainable low-carbon development. Tremendous efforts have been 
made in mitigating the country’s GHG emissions with available resources and capabilities. In 
addition,  Thailand  as  a  party  to  the  UNFCCC  has  voluntarily  submitted  its  Nationally 
Appropriate  Mitigation  Actions  (NAMAs)  in  2014.  In  2016,  Thailand’s  1st  Nationally 
Determined Contribution (NDC) was communicated to UNFCCC upon its ratification of the 
Paris Agreement, indicating its mitigation and adaptation contribution to the global efforts to 
address climate change.  The updated NDC was later communicated in 2020. NAMAs and 
NDCs are key policy instruments that shape Thailand’s climate actions in pursuing its low GHG 
emission and climate-resilient development. 
2.1 Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) 
In 2014, Thailand submitted its NAMAs to UNFCCC, pledging to reduce its greenhouse gas 
emissions in energy and transportation sectors by 7-20 percent from the projected business 
as usual level by 2020. The target of 7% GHG mitigation in 2020 is intended to be achieved 
using domestic resources, while additional emission reduction up to 20% is subject to 
sufficient international support under the UNFCCC. 
Strong and positive progress has been achieved during Thailand’s NAMAs implementation.  In 
2019, Thailand reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 64.20 MtCO eq, or 17 % from its 
2
projected business as usual level (See Figure 2-1).  This achievement demonstrates robust

2.2 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) 
Thailand submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to UNFCCC in 
2015, which was later to become Thailand’s first NDC. The NDC was formulated in accordance 
with the Philosophy of Sufficiency Economy and the principle of Sustainable Development, 
and based on relevant national plans already approved or in the pipeline for approval by the 
Cabinet. It also builds upon measures, and takes into account lessons learnt and good 
practices during NAMAs implementation. Thailand’s first NDC indicates an emission reduction 
of 20% from the projected business-as-usual (BAU) level by 2030. The level of contribution 
could  increase  up  to  25%,  subject  to  adequate  and  enhanced  access  to  technology 
development and transfer, financial resources and capacity building  support  through a 
balanced and ambitious global agreement under UNFCCC. Besides, adaptation priorities and 
support need are clearly outlined.  
In 2020, Thailand communicated its updated NDC to the UNFCCC, confirming its mitigation 
contribution by 2030.  It also provided the most up-to-date information on its progress in the 
implementation of its pre-2020 action, concrete implementation plans, and key information 
of adaptation component and support needs. 
2.3 Implementation of Mitigation Measures 
The  heart  of  Thailand's  NDC  development  and  implementation  is  being  realistic  and 
achievable and with a balanced consideration between emission reduction and economic 
development. Climate change mitigation policies have been integrated and translated from 
24 
    
 
 
the 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan (2017- 2021, extended to 2022) to 
sectoral and local levels. 
Specifically, the NDC Roadmap and sectoral action plans are developed in 4 sectors, namely 
energy, transportation, industrial processes and product use, and waste management. Strong 
collaboration among key stakeholders and supporting mechanisms are also key success 
factors in achieving this target.  
2.3.1 NDC Roadmap (2021-2030)  
Following the submission of Thailand’s first NDC, the Cabinet endorsed the NDC Roadmap 
(2021-2030) in 2017 as a clear guidance to achieve its NDC targets. Developed under a 
participatory approach and through a national consultative process, this Roadmap identifies 
a set of mitigation actions in the energy, transportation, IPPU and waste management sectors. 
NDC Roadmap to strive towards the reduction of 115.6 MtCO , which accounts for a 20.83% 
2eq
reduction in 2030 when compared to the BAU level.  Mitigation actions in the NDC Roadmap 
are identified based on the following policies and plans: 
• 12th National Economics and Social Development Plan 2017-2021, extended to 2022 
• Climate Change Master Plan 2015-2050 
• Power Development Plan 2015-2036 
• Thailand Smart Grid Development Master Plan 2015-2036 
• Energy Efficiency Plan 2015-2036 
• Alternative Energy Development Plan 2015-2036 
• Environmentally Sustainable Transport System Plan 2013-2030 
• National Industrial Development Master Plan 2012-2031 
• Waste Management Roadmap 
Mitigation measures under NDC Roadmap (2021-2030) can be summarized as shown in Table 2-1.

2.3.2 NDC Sectoral Action Plans 2021-2030 
The NDC Sectoral Action Plans 2021-2030 were developed to support the implementation of 
NDC Roadmap (2021-2030) in four sectors, namely energy, transport, industrial processes and 
product  use,  and  waste  management.  It  allocates  emission  reduction  targets  for  each 
identified measure with the aim to facilitate the relevant sectoral agencies in fulfilling their 
respective emission reduction targets. These sectoral action plans were prepared by relevant 
sectoral agencies, with a wide range of stakeholder consultation and public participation 
processes. They include the details of potential activities/projects, objectives, indicators and 
source of funding/budget.  
It is estimated that measures under the NDC Sectoral Action Plans have the potential to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 156.86 MtCO  in 2030 as shown in Figure 2-2. This 
2eq
provides a concrete implementation roadmap in achieving Thailand’s first NDC mitigation 
target. 
 
Figure 2-2: GHG reduction potential in 2030 according to the NDC sectoral action plans 
26 
    
 
 
The summary of the NDC sectoral action plans are as follows. 
•  The NDC Action Plan in Energy Sector, prepared by the Energy Policy and Planning 
Office, Ministry of Energy, identifies potential mitigation measures such as increasing 
energy efficiency and promoting renewable energy (Energy Policy and Planning Office, 
2019). 
•  The NDC Action Plan in Transport Sector, prepared by the Office of Transport and 
Traffic  Policy  and  Planning,  Ministry  of  Transport, identifies  potential  mitigation 
measures from relevant plans such as travel demand management (TDM), transit-
oriented development (TOD), expansion of railway network, and bus fleet upgrades 
(Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning, 2019). 
•  The NDC Action Plan in Industrial Processes and Product Use including Industrial 
Wastewater Sector, prepared by the Department of Industrial Works, Ministry of 
Industry,  identifies  potential  mitigation  measures  such  as  clinker  substitution, 
refrigerant  replacement  and  industrial  wastewater  management  (Department  of 
Industrial Works, 2019). 
•  The NDC Action Plan in Municipal Waste Management Sector, prepared by the 
Pollution  Control  Department,  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment, 
identifies potential mitigation measures such as municipal solid waste management 
and municipal wastewater management (Pollution Control Department, 2018). 
 
Additionally, supportive mechanisms for effective implementation of the sectoral action plans 
are  considered  in  the  areas  such  as  research  and  development,  economic  tools  and 
mechanisms,  laws  and  regulations,  MRV  system,  capacity  building  and  stakeholder 
engagement.  
 
2.3.3 Existing Economic Mechanisms 
National climate change implementation plans, strategic plans or other medium-term plans 
are important to secure political commitments and reaffirm country's commitment to global 
mitigation  efforts  under  the  Convention.  To  enhance  an  effective  implementation  of 
mitigation actions, unprecedented change and deep reductions in GHG emissions across the 
country's  economy  are  needed.  Investment  in  state-of-the-art  technologies  would  be 
necessary to achieve the stringent emission reduction targets. The development of economic 
mechanisms is one of many critical factors in supporting greenhouse gas reduction activities 
for entrepreneurs and civilians. 
The Office of the Board of Investment (BOI) is a government agency under the Office of the 
Prime Minister whose primary mission is to promote valuable investment in Thailand. In 2021, 
the BOI approved a series of incentives to promote investments that reduce environmental 
impacts, support sustainable development, and contribute to the development of the BCG 
(Bio, Circular and Green economy) model, which the Thai government has identified as a 
priority to lead the post-COVID 19 recovery. These measures include the following: 
27 
    
 
 
(1)  The  grassroots  economy  support  scheme  will  also  include  support  for  local 
organizations involved in developing sustainable agricultural activities such as low 
methane  rice  farming.  It  is  expected  that  this  new  addition  will  encourage 
competent businesses to participate in the sustainable agriculture movement. It 
also extends the deadline for applications under the grassroots economy support 
scheme to the end of 2022. 
(2)  A 3-year tax exemption will be granted for investments in upgrading machinery to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is in addition to the existing productivity 
enhancement scheme. It is expected that this new measure will contribute to the 
country's commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
(3)  Adjustments to the conditions and benefits for some categories of business to 
encourage eco-friendly technologies: 
•  Investments  in  cold  storage  facilities  and  refrigerated  transport  that  use 
natural refrigerants and reduce environmental impact will be granted 3-year 
corporate income tax exemptions. 
•  Petrochemical production facilities that use Carbon Capture Utilization and 
Storage (CCUS) technologies will be granted 8-year corporate income tax 
exemptions. 
(4)  Introduction of a new promotion category for natural gas separation plants which 
if they are implementing CCUS technologies will be granted 8-year corporate 
income tax exemptions. 
Moreover, Thai government envisions the country becoming the largest electric vehicle 
investment hub in one of the world's fastest-growing economic blocs. The National Electronic 
Vehicles Policy Committee, set up by the Thai government, recently introduced a master plan 
that sets out a framework for the development of electric vehicles. The main objective of this 
master plan is to establish Thailand as "ASEAN's center of excellence" in three areas, namely 
zero-emission vehicles, next-generation automotive technology, and innovation in the next-
generation  business  models  by  2035.  Investment  promotion  policies  have  also  been 
introduced for the production of all types of electric vehicles (EVs) to further boost the EV 
sector. The investment promotion will extend to the production of BEV platforms, which 
consist of an energy storage system, a charging module, and a front and rear axle module. 
The concept of shared platforms is a new trend in the automotive industry, offering greater 
flexibility, shorter product development times and economies of scale. In addition, the 
promotion  of  electric  bicycles  (E-bikes)  also  offers  tax  incentives,  i.e.  exemption  from 
corporate income tax for at least 3 years.

Chapter 3 
Long-term Low Greenhouse GasEmission Development 
 
The Paris Agreement sets out a long-term temperature goal and underscores the urgency for 
Parties to play their part to enable global GHG emissions to peak and decline as soon as 
possible. In accordance with Article 4, paragraph 19, of the Paris Agreement, all Parties should 
strive to formulate and communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development 
strategies, mindful of Article 2, considering their common but differentiated responsibilities 
and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances. 
In this regard, the mid-century, long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy 
was  formulated  to  guide  Thailand  towards  a  climate-resilient  and  low  GHG  emissions 
development  and  serves  as  a  basis  for  enhancing  its  pre-2050  mitigation  actions.  The 
preparation and approval process of Thailand’s LEDS includes a national consultative process 
among various sectoral working groups and relevant stakeholders with the objective to identify 
a set of national long-term GHG mitigation actions in the energy, transport, IPPU, waste, 
agriculture and LULUCF sectors. A national consultation was organized to hear comments and 
encourage discussion on the outcome of the study before submitting it for consideration by the 
national  working  group  on  integration  of  GHG  mitigation  policy  and  planning,  the 
Subcommittee on Climate Change Policy and Planning Integration, and the NCCC and Cabinet 
before submitting it to the UNFCCC. (See Figure 3-1) 
 
Figure 3-1: Preparation and approval process of Thailand’s LEDS 
29 
    
 
 
The Subcommittee on Climate Change Policy and Planning Integration is responsible to provide 
input and recommendation on the development and integration of climate change policy, 
strategy and plan, in relation to both mitigation and adaptation; provide suggestions on 
mechanisms and measures, such as legal regulations, and financial measures; and push 
forward an integrated budget allocation system on climate change. In the development of 
Thailand’s  LEDS,  this  subcommittee  considers  and  provides  suggestions  on  the  draft 
document in which the working group on national GHG reduction policy and plan integration 
has integrated relevant information among the ministerial agencies and academic institutes 
related to climate change to formulate mid-century low greenhouse gas emissions. However, 
the other four subcommittees will be informed of the progress of Thailand’s LEDS formulation 
through the existing mechanism when it is submitted to the NCCC for consideration. 
3.1 Methodology for the Development of Long-term Low Greenhouse Gas 
Emission Pathways  
3.1.1 Model for Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Pathways 
Thailand’s mid-century, long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy was 
developed based on the scenario of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the second half of 
this century, in line with science and the Paris Agreement. The BAU scenario was developed 
using input information of the current country’s circumstances and status provided by related 
ministerial agencies into the Asia-Pacific Integrated Assessment Model (AIM) (Figure 3-2). 
 
Figure 3-2: Framework of Thailand’s LEDS Development 
 
30 
    
 
 
•  The AIM/EndUse 
The AIM model has been developed through the collaboration between the National Institute 
for Environmental Studies (NIES) Japan, Kyoto University, the Mizuho Information & Research 
Institute, and other researchers in Asia, including Thailand. The AIM model focuses on 
relevant policies to support low-carbon pathways. 
The AIM/EndUse model was used to quantify climate change assessment and relevant policies 
to mitigate GHG emissions. The model is a recursive dynamic model, a partial equilibrium, 
which can simulate the calculation for numerous years with several case studies, including 
policy countermeasures for mid-century mitigation actions to examine the effect of energy 
savings and GHG emission abatement. It is a bottom-up model with detailed technology 
information. The technological selection is based on a linear optimization framework which 
minimizes the total system cost with the introduction of various constraints, for example, the 
availability of biomass in biomass power plants, satisfaction of the end-user demand and CO  
2
emission tax applied for energy intensive activities. The total system cost consists of the 
annualized initial investment costs of technologies, annualized operating and maintenance 
costs of technologies, energy costs, taxes (both energy tax and carbon tax) and subsidies, etc. 
In order to calculate the annualized cost, the capital recovery factor is used. 
Thailand’s  LEDS  were  modeled  in  a  bottom-up  approach  with  detailed-technology 
information. The  technological selection is  based  on  an  optimization framework which 
minimized the total system cost subject to various constraints, e.g. the potential of solar, wind 
and bio-energy used in power generation, and satisfying the end-user demand among the 
economic sectors. In the model, CH  and N O are converted into CO -equivalent emissions by 
4 2 2
applied global warming potential (GWP) provided by the IPCC. Under this modeling approach, 
it is projected that the Business-as-usual of the economy-wide GHG emissions (excluding 
LULUCF) in 2050 will be approximately 661 MtCO . 
2eq
The AIM/EndUse model consists of both demand side and supply side. The manufacturing 
industry  is  classified  into  9  sub-sectors  which  is  in  line  with  the  classification  by  the 
Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency, Ministry of Energy. The 
analyses in the industrial system can be separated into heating systems (thermal) and 
electricity systems. The technologies introduced in the manufacturing industries include 
efficient kilns in the non-metallic industry, LED lamps and efficient lighting, efficient air 
conditioners, etc. The residential sector can be divided into three types, namely, the greater 
Bangkok area, municipal areas, and rural areas. The technologies introduced in the residential 
sector include efficient air conditioners with high COP, LED lamps and efficient lighting, solar 
water heating systems, etc. The commercial building sector is divided into eight types, which 
are offices, hotels, hospitals, department stores, schools, hyper-mart, condominium, and 
other buildings. Technologies introduced in this sector include efficient boilers, LED lamps and 
efficient lighting, efficient heating systems, etc. Both residential and commercial building 
sectors, hereafter called the “building sector”, are investigated in terms of energy use and 
31 
    
 
 
GHG emissions. Transport service can be classified into passenger transport and freight 
transport. Furthermore, the transport sector has been divided into road, rail, air and water 
modes. However, the policy assessment and CO  emissions mitigation mainly focuses on road 
2
transport. There are nine vehicle types considered in the transport sector: sedans, vans, tri-
cycles, taxis, motorcycles, buses, pick-ups, trucks, and others. Diesel (locomotive) and electric 
trains are considered in the rail mode. Technologies introduced in the transport sector include 
plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles, electric trains, etc. Figure 3-3 shows an overview 
of the input of the AIM/EndUse model in developing Thailand’s LEDS. 
 
Figure 3-3: Overview of the input of the AIM/EndUse model in developing Thailand’s LEDS 
•  The AIM/CGE  
To understand the macroeconomic impacts of Thailand’s LEDS, a multi sector, dynamic 
recursive Asia-Pacific Integrated Model/Computable General Equilibrium (AIM/CGE) model is 
used.  The CGE model is known for its strength in evaluating economy-related policies, so it 
has been widely adopted to assess the economic and environmental impacts of various 
energy and climate policies at the global, national, and sub-national levels. It is noted that in 
Thailand’s LEDS, the carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions, methane (CH ) and nitrous oxide (N O) 
2 4 2
are treated as GHG emissions in the model. 
The model consists of four main blocks, namely production, government and household 
income,  expenditure  blocks  and  market  block  that  considers  both  the  domestic  and 
international transactions (see Figure 3-4).  
32 
    
 
 
The CGE model used for the development of Thailand’s LEDS uses the input-output table 
obtained from the Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) 
to calibrate the model. The model considered in the analysis is disaggregated into detailed 
production sub-sectors (see Table 3-1).

of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, Ministry of Natural Resources and 
Environment.  
15) 20-year Forest Strategic Plan (2017-2036) prepared by the Royal Forest Department, 
Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. This strategic plan aims at increasing 
forest area covering up to 40% through local community participation, particularly in 
upstream basin and mangrove forests. It would enhance greenhouse gas removals through 
forest-related actions. 
Details of these plans can be found in the bibliography.  
3.2 Long-term sectoral emissions 
3.2.1 The business-as usual 
The business-as usual (BAU) emissions were developed based on technical analyses and 
consultation with relevant stakeholders by the working group on Thailand’s LEDS, including 
energy, industrial processes and product use (IPPU), waste, agriculture, and land use, land-
use change and forestry (LULUCF) sectors. The energy consumption pattern and the GHG 
trajectory in the BAU follow the past trend during 2010-2020. Climate policies intervention is 
excluded from the BAU. Results reveal that Thailand’s GHG emissions of sources will increase 
from 305 MtCO eq in 2005 to 661 MtCO eq in 2050, increasing at a compound annual growth 
2 2
rate (CAGR) of 1.7%. The energy sector will be the largest source of GHG emissions, followed 
by the agriculture, the IPPU, and the waste sectors, while the LULUCF sector will play a vital 
role in the removal of emissions in the BAU (see Figure 3-5). The GHG removal from the 
LULUCF sector will gradually increase from 50 MtCO eq in 2005 to 100 MtCO eq in 2050, at 
2 2
the rate of 1.5% annually. It is noted that Thailand’s Third Biennial Update Report (BUR3) 
indicated an average GHG removal by LULUCF of 73 MtCO eq between 2005 and 2016.

Figure 3-5: GHG emissions/removals by sector in 2005 – 2050 in the BAU scenario 
 
Despite the fact that the removal of greenhouse gases will moderately increase, it will be 
slowly increasing compared to GHG emissions of sources. In order to achieve the Paris 
Agreement goal, it is necessary for Thailand to focus its attention on increasing its ambition 
in GHG emissions reduction.  
 
3.2.2 Long-term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy 
The GHG removal in the LULUCF sector will be slightly increased to 120 MtCO  by 2037 and 
2eq
maintain stable through the end of this century. This projection is based on forest and green 
area target identified in the National Strategy (2018 – 2037) that aims to increase forest and 
green areas. Thus, Thailand will achieve the net GHG emissions of 200 MtCO eq in 2050 or a 
2
decrease of 64% compared to emissions in the BAU (See Figure 3-6). The GHG emissions from 
sources will reach the peak level of 370 MtCO eq by 2030. In 2050, the energy sector will play 
2
a key role in mitigating GHG emissions.  In addition, the LULUCF sector will contribute the 
removal of 5.6% of total GHG reduction in 2050. The post-2050 emissions will follow the IPCC 
2-degree pathways, in which under this scenario, Thailand will achieve the balance between 
GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks in 2090.

Figure 3-6: Thailand’s long-term low greenhouse gas emission scenario 
 
Energy system 
The energy sector plays an important role in the reduction of GHG emissions in Thailand’s 
LEDS (Figure 3-6). Therefore, stringent GHG mitigation measures are needed to implement in 
the energy sector. The GHG mitigation measures implemented in the energy sector are 
generally classified into three main measures: energy efficiency improvement/technology 
switching, implementation of renewable energy, and carbon capture and storage (CCS). GHG 
mitigation measures identified for energy system are:  
•  Power  generation:  The  energy  efficiency  improvement  and  the  deployment  of 
natural gas with CCS and coal with CCS power plants, will increase to 43% in 2050 
when compared to the current technology. 
In 2050, the share of renewable electricity will increase to 33% of total electricity 
generation. In addition, bio-energy with CCS (BECCS) power plant is needed to 
achieve the 2-degree target in 2050. 
•  Transport sector: The energy efficiency improvement will be achieved by behavioral 
changes,  road  surface  improvement  and  engine  performance  improvement. 
Currently, the proportion of new efficient vehicle fleets is increasing, including 
hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles. Under Thailand’s LEDS, the 
transport sector needs to increase the energy efficiency to 68% of total final energy 
consumption  in  2050.  Though  the  share  of  energy  efficiency  improvement 
decreases, the energy consumption in the efficient vehicle increases. 
Liquid biofuels have been promoted as clean alternative fuels in the transport sector. 
To achieve the targets under Thailand’s LEDS, the share of liquid biofuel use will have 
to increase from 8% in 2030 to 34% of total final energy consumption in 2050. 
38 
    
 
 
•  Manufacturing industries: Final energy consumption in manufacturing industries 
varies depending on the activities. For example, the heating system is used mainly in 
the food and beverage industries, and the chemical industries. The textile industries 
demand  large  amounts  of  electricity  in  their  processes.  The  energy  efficiency 
improvement of electrical devices has to increase to 77%. In the heating systems, the 
share of renewable energy will have to increase to approximately 46% and 50% of 
total final energy consumption in 2030 and 2050, respectively. 
Moreover, the deployment of CCS in industries will play a significant role in the 
chemical  and  the  non-metallic  sub-industries.  The  estimated  captured  carbon 
dioxides will be 18 MtCO eq in 2050. 
2
•  Residential sector: Electricity accounts for the highest energy consumption in the 
residential sector. Household air conditioners are one of the key drivers of electricity 
demand in Thailand. The energy efficiency improvement of energy devices in the 
residential sector will have to increase to 29% of total final energy consumption in 
2050.  
The share of renewable energy use in households will have to increase to 49% of 
total final energy consumption in 2050. Such a heating demand is driven by the 
cooking  system.  Though  the  share  of  renewable  energy  used  for  heating  is 
decreasing, the amount of renewable energy consumption will increase. 
•  Commercial buildings: The energy efficiency improvement of energy devices in the 
commercial buildings will have to increase to 33% of total final energy consumption 
in 2050.  Solar water heating devices have to be promoted to produce hot water in 
hotels, condominiums, and hospitals. The share of solar water heating will have to 
increase to 5% of total final energy consumption in 2050. 
Therefore, the GHG emissions in the energy sector is projected to be approximately 220.0 
MtCO  in 2050. 
2eq
 
IPPU 
Thailand’s LEDS of the IPPU sector is developed based on the mitigation measures identified 
in the NDC Action Plan in the industrial processes and product use including industrial 
wastewater sector 2021 – 2030. These mitigation measures consist of the modification of 
industrial production processes including clinker substitution, substitution of refrigerant and 
industrial wastewater management, including increasing biogas production from industrial 
wastewater by recycling methane gas. Then, the emission trajectory during 2031-2050 was 
modelled and estimated in Thailand’s LEDS process. Results indicate that the GHG emissions 
in the IPPU sector will be 34.0 MtCO  in 2050. 
2eq
 
Waste 
Thailand’s LEDS of the waste sector is developed based on the mitigation measures identified 
in the NDC Action Plan in Municipal Waste Management 2021 – 2030. The action plan consists 
39 
    
 
 
of work plans/activities on community solid waste management and community wastewater 
management that has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas. The GHG emissions reduction 
measures  include  waste  reduction,  landfill  gas,  waste  to  energy,  semi  aerobic  landfill, 
composting,  anaerobic  digestion  and  mechanical  biological  treatment.  The  emission 
trajectory in the waste sector during 2031-2050 was modelled and estimated in Thailand’s 
LEDS process. Therefore, it shows a potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 
community solid waste management and community wastewater management in which the 
GHG emissions from the waste sector is projected to be approximately 16.0 MtCO  in 2050. 
2eq
 
Agriculture 
The development of  Thailand’s  LEDS  of  the  agriculture sector takes  into  consideration 
adaptation measures identified in the existing policies and plans that have mitigation co-
benefits such as enteric fermentation, and manure management.  In this study, it is perceived 
that adaptation measures in rice cultivation and agricultural soil will contribute to lower GHG 
emissions in the agriculture sector post-2050. The emission trajectory in the agriculture sector 
during 2031-2050 was modelled and estimated in Thailand’s LEDS process. Thus, the GHG 
emissions from the agriculture sector is projected to be approximately 50.0 MtCO  in 2050. 
2eq
 
LULUCF 
The development of the Thailand’s LEDS of the LULUCF sector is based on the National 
Strategy (2018-2037). The implementation of the strategy will drastically increase carbon 
sinks as the key measures include increasing and remaining primary forest and regenerated 
natural forest area, increasing economic forest area, increasing and remaining cropland, and 
reducing biomass burning. It is expected that the implementation of the strategy will lead to 
carbon dioxide removals in the LULUCF of approximately 120.0 MtCO  in 2050.  
2eq
3.3 Macroeconomic Impact Assessment 
The development of national policies, including in relation to climate change should carefully 
consider the direction and pattern of local and global development. A country's development 
patterns are greatly influenced by public health policy, energy security, transport and urban 
infrastructure and capital investment, particularly investment in the manufacturing and 
service sectors, which are key drivers of a country's economy. To achieve the 2-degree 
pathway  by  2050,  the  intensive  climate  policy  packages  are  needed.  Therefore,  it  is 
imperative  to  understand  the  economic  impacts  as  a  result  of  the  adoption  and 
implementation  of  such  packages.  In  the  development  of  Thailand’s  LEDS,  the 
macroeconomic impacts are mainly considered in terms of total energy system cost, GDP and 
welfare. In addition, the carbon prices by 2050 were also estimated. 
 
 
40 
    
 
 
3.3.1 Total energy system cost 
Thailand  requires  additional  investment  in  the  infrastructure  in  power  generation, 
transportation, manufacturing industries, and buildings. In the power sector, the present 
worth of the power system cost will be increased by 62.0% compared to the BAU level (see 
Table 3-2). The natural gas power plants with CCS and bio-energy with CCS require the highest 
investment in 2050, followed by wind and solar powers. The transport system cost will be 
increased by 16.2% compared to the BAU level. Electric trucks and electric pick-ups will 
account for the highest share of investment followed by electric buses and trucks. In the 
manufacturing industries, the energy efficiency improvement in the heating and the motor 
systems and the deployment of CCS require the highest investment in the non-metallic and 
the chemical industries in 2050. The manufacturing industries system cost will be increased 
by  15.3%  compared  to  the  BAU  level.  The  heating  systems,  cooling  systems,  and  the 
installation of solar water heating systems require the highest investment in the building 
sector; however, building sector shows almost unchanged investment compared to the BAU 
level because of the reduction in technology prices and greater use of the energy efficient 
technology during 2030-2050. 
Table 3-2: Change of net present value of total energy system cost 
Change of total energy system cost  
compared to the BAU 
Sector 
(%) 
 
Power generation  62.0 
Transportation  16.2 
Manufacturing industries  15.3 
 
3.3.2 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
The GDP is one of the important primary macroeconomic indicators. It measures the status 
of a country’s economy. The assessment concludes that measures identified in Thailand’s 
LEDS of the 2-degree pathway will lead to a decline in the GDP compared to the BAU 2050. 
There will be a slight GDP loss during 2021-2037. The GDP loss in 2030 is estimated to be 
2.61% while stringent nation-wide GHG mitigation measures after 2037 will result in higher 
GDP losses of 6.6% in 2040 and 18.01% in 2050, respectively. In order to avoid this GDP loss, 
Thailand will need to prepare a transitional plan for its transformation in the energy and 
transport infrastructure to create the opportunities and increase the value of investment in 
low-emission and environmentally friendly businesses. This domestic preparation, together 
with the expected lower costs of advanced GHG mitigation technologies, will mitigate such 
economic impacts and result in a better economy in a long run. 
41 
    
 
 
3.3.3 Welfare 
Government and household consumption form the major components in the national GDP. 
The 2-degree pathway by 2050 will result in a significant increment in the government 
consumption and a drastic decline in the household consumption. The average welfare loss is 
estimated at 5.0% during 2020-2030. The steep decline in the household consumption, in the 
attempt to attain the emission target by 2050, will lead to a sharp increase in the welfare 
losses. Thailand’s economy will face severe damages at a welfare loss of 21.3% during 2030-
2050.  Thailand may increase government expenditures to boost economic activities. The 
implementation  of  emission  reduction  measures  under  Thailand’s  LEDS  will  increase 
government spending on welfare benefits, education, research and training, manufacturing 
industries, power generation, transportation, infrastructure investments, etc. 
3.3.4 Carbon Price 
Carbon  price  is  estimated  to  be  88  US$/tCO   in  2025  and  109  US$/tCO   in  2030, 
2eq 2eq
respectively. However, carbon price will exponentially increase to 368 US$/tCO  in 2050 due 
2eq
to the stringent GHG mitigation measures after 2037, which is similar to the study by IIASA 
that found the average carbon price in Asia will be 390 US$/tCO  by 2050.  
2eq
A higher carbon price leads to a larger reduction in the household consumption of goods and 
services as well as demands for switching to cleaner energy resources and technologies. To 
lower the carbon prices, Thailand’s economy needs to enhance the deployment of energy 
efficient technologies. 
The macroeconomic assessment also shows that in the absence of technological progress, 
reaching a more ambitious emission reduction goal beyond the 2-degree pathway to attain 
the 1.5-degree pathway by 2050, or balancing between GHG emissions by sources and 
removals by sinks in 2050, will yield a prohibitively high economic cost. In addition, there is a 
need for extensive investments in low carbon technology options and attempts to limit the 
macroeconomic loss to meet the 1.5-degree pathway by 2050. Considering Thailand's current 
economic development and industrial structure, an intensive transformation of the entire 
system is required to move from the fossil fuel-based economy. To balance emissions 
reduction with economic growth, all sectors need to be transformed, including the basic 
patterns of people's daily activities. 
3.4 Co-benefits of Long-term Low Emissions 
Key mitigation actions are needed to reduce the proportion of fossil fuel use. These measures 
are necessary for the private sector, especially the industrial sector, even though the impact 
would be short term. If all sectors do not begin to make this transition, the losses will be even 
greater. Despite some potential negative socio-economic impacts, the implementation of 
Thailand’s LEDS is likely to have positive impacts such as an increase in domestic eco-
investment and green consumption and the creation of green employment. This will bring 
about a paradigm shift and lead to long-term sustainable development in Thailand. 
42 
    
 
 
In terms of energy security, an indicator based on the diversity of primary energy, which is an 
indicator of the diversity of energy sources to support the energy needs in the country, shows 
that Thailand’s LEDS and the BAU 2050 will have almost the same value of diversity of primary 
energy. This is because Thailand has limited options of energy resources. The new form of 
energy, such as hydrogen, would improve the energy security of Thailand. However, the 
indicator on net gas import dependency in Thailand’s LEDS will be much lower than that in 
the BAU 2050. 
The mitigation co-benefit is a key consideration for the development of Thailand’s LEDS. There 
are two types of co-benefits examined under Thailand’s LEDS, which are energy intensity and 
CO  emissions per capita (CECap). It is projected that the energy intensity and CO  emissions 
2 2
per capita (CECap) in the BAU 2050 will be 0.62 ktoe/USD and 7.37 ton-CO  per capita, 
2
respectively, while in Thailand’s LTS 2050 they will be 0.50 ktoe/USD and 2.42 ton-CO  per 
2
capita, respectively. This finding clearly reveals a good improvement of these indicators. 
In conclusion, the results of co-benefit analysis under Thailand’s LEDS indicates a decreasing 
in energy intensity of 19.4% and a decrease in CECap of 67.2% compared to the BAU 2050. In 
addition,  the  measures  implemented  under  Thailand’s  LEDS  will  help  reduce  local  air 
pollutants generated from combustion of fossil fuels, such as NOx, CO, NMVOC and PM2.5.  
3.5 Thailand Carbon Neutrality 
With global warming requiring rapid and comprehensive actions to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, many countries have stepped up efforts to shift to clean energy and decarbonized 
activities. Thailand also has focused its attention on reducing carbon dioxide emission in the 
energy sector, which is the largest contributor of GHG emission, in order to support the 
achievement of Thailand’s LEDS goal. Thailand has formulated the National Energy Plan (NEP 
2022)  framework  as  a  policy  framework  to  guide  the  related  agencies  to  achieve  the 
transformational change to clean energy systems and will achieve the goal of becoming a 
carbon neutral country in 2065-2070. In addition to Thailand’s LEDS, Thailand considered two 
additional scenarios focusing on only carbon dioxide emissions in the energy, IPPU, waste and 
agriculture sectors as follows: 
•  Thailand carbon neutrality by 2070 scenario. In this scenario, the share of renewable 
electricity generation will be at least 50% of new power generation capacity by 2050 
and new vehicles in the market will be electric vehicle (Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) 
and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)) with the share of 69% by 2035. Under this 
scenario, carbon dioxide emissions in the IPPU, waste and agriculture sectors will 
follow the 2-degree pathway. 
•  Thailand carbon neutrality by 2065 scenario. This scenario employs the same policy 
and measures in the 2070 scenario and also includes energy efficiency improvement. 
The  2070  and  2065  carbon  neutrality  scenarios  are  presented  in  Figures  3-7  and  3-8, 
respectively. The net nationwide carbon dioxide emissions under the 2070 scenario and the 
43 
    
 
 
2065 scenario will be 62 MtCO  and 41 MtCO  in 2050, respectively. Consequently, Thailand 
2 2
will achieve a net zero carbon dioxide emission by 2070 with 50% share of renewable 
electricity plants in the new power generation capacity and 69% share of new electric vehicles 
on the market by 2035. Furthermore, Thailand will achieve net zero carbon dioxide emissions 
as early as 2065 if it applies the same policies and measures as in the 2070 scenario and 
incorporates energy efficiency improvement. 
 
Figure 3-7: Thailand carbon neutrality by 2070 scenario 
 
Figure 3-8: Thailand carbon neutrality by 2065 scenario 
 
To achieve the carbon neutrality by 2065, Thailand emphasizes the importance of innovation 
and RD&D, especially in the areas for low carbon electricity generation, CCS, bio-energy with 
CCS and hydrogen economy. Public transport infrastructure and networks will be priorities to 
44 
    
 
 
decarbonize  the  transport  sector.  A  complete  transformation  of  the  vehicle  fleet,  the 
development of public EV fast charging networks, and hydrogen fueling stations are required 
as early as possible. The new energy policy framework of Thailand’s carbon neutral target set 
by Ministry of Energy in 2021 includes: 
1)  Policy direction to increase the share of new renewable electricity generation to be 
at least 50%, increase the share of electric vehicles to be at least 30% by 2030, 
increase energy efficiency by reduce energy intensity at least 30% by 2037, and 
promote energy system transformation through decarbonization, digitalization, 
decentralization, deregulation, and electrification.  
 
2)  Framework of energy system transformation in the power sector includes (i) low 
carbon power generation to achieve Thailand’s carbon neutrality by 2065-2070, (ii) 
carbon capture and storage (CCS), (iii) carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS), 
(iv) grid modernization to support disruptive technologies such as smart energy 
management and energy storage systems, (v) distributed generation through smart 
micro grids to support peer-to-peer and net-metering markets and (iv) low carbon 
electrification such as battery electric vehicles and EV infrastructure. 
3)  Framework of energy system transformation in natural gas includes (i) promoting 
liquefied natural gas (LNG) in industries and transportation, (ii) improving natural 
gas system management, (iii) infrastructure development of LNG, and (iv) good 
governance of natural gas market. 
4)  Framework of energy system transformation in oil includes (i) improving petroleum 
distillation process to meet EURO5 and EURO 6 standards, (ii) promoting low carbon 
fuels such as biofuels used in transportation including removing petroleum subsidy, 
(iii)  improving  the  infrastructure  and  modern  management  system  and  (iv) 
promoting battery electric vehicles and revising management system of liquefied 
petroleum gas (LPG), including shifting from LPG stoves in households to electric 
stoves. 
5)  Framework of alternative energy to increase renewable electricity generation to 
50% by 2050 and integration of energy storage in the long term to lessen impacts of 
increasing energy prices. The energy system transformation needs to (i) increase 
domestic renewable energy production, (ii) promote distributed generation, micro-
grids  and  grassroots  economy,  (iii)  digitalize  renewable  energy  control  center 
platform for both on-grid and off-grid areas, (iv) provide incentives and policies that 
support renewable energy investment and markets, and (v) promote renewable 
energy  technology  investment,  bio-economy,  research  and  development  of 
hydrogen, and bio-jet. 
6)  Framework  of  energy  efficiency  improvement  includes  digital  technology  and 
innovation to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce investment in new 
45 
   power plants. The energy efficiency business will help promoting Energy Service 
Companies  (ESCO)  and  job  opportunities.  The  supportive  actions  include  (i) 
increasing energy efficiency target measures such as Building Energy Codes (BEC), 
Energy Efficiency Resource Standards (EERS) and ESCO business, (ii) promoting 
Green  Buildings  and  Industries  by  using  smart  energy  management,  and  (iii) 
promoting digital platform for energy savings, smart energy management, EV data 
platforms and EV infrastructure, including sufficient number of EV charging stations. 
Thailand’s carbon neutral target is fundamental for achieving its net zero greenhouse gas 
emissions target. It is an ambitious move for developing countries that have limited access to 
modern energy infrastructure. The NEP 2022 is a starting point for energy transition in 
Thailand as it contains concrete measures to reduce carbon emissions in the near future. 
3.6 Support Needs 
Transition to a low-carbon society in Thailand, through the implementation of policies and 
measures  identified  in  Thailand’s  LEDS  and  the  carbon  neutral  pathway,  requires  a 
contribution of all sectors and actors. Thailand is looking for more low-carbon business 
models from both domestic and international investors. This opportunity will enable Thailand 
to build forward better to become a green economy country after the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The green economy ecosystem will be accelerated with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions to net-zero. However, to achieve Thailand's LEDS targets, international cooperation 
and  support  is  needed for  policy  development, research and  technology development, 
mechanisms and instruments, and capacity building, as follows: 
Policy implementation 
• Build capacity in the public and private sectors to integrate mitigation action into
their respective plans or enterprises.
• Raise awareness on climate change, Thailand’s LEDS and NDCs among relevant
stakeholders and the general public.
Research development and deployment (RD &D) in the following priority areas: 
Energy and transport sector 
• Renewable energy technologies (such as solar, wind) and approaches in advanced
energy storage system (EES) and demand-side management.
• Carbon capture and storage (CCS) or carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS)
in power plant and industries
• Bio-energy with CCS
• Electric Vehicle (xEV), battery and Infrastructures
• Grid Modernization, smart energy management and Independent Power Supply (IPS)
• Other technologies related to carbon neutrality (Hydrogen, Bio-hydrogenated diesel
(BHD)
46  
 
 
Other sectors 
•  Smart energy management in the industrial sector 
•  Waste-to-energy technologies in the waste sector 
•  CH4 reduction technologies in agriculture such as enteric fermentation and manure 
management and rice cultivation. 
Mechanisms and instruments 
•  Financial instruments, incentives, mechanisms and approaches to engage the 
private sector in the shift to green investment. 
•  Share knowledge and best practices on legal frameworks and modalities to support 
Thailand’s LEDS and NDC implementation. 
3.7 Implementation Approach  
Thailand's first best practices during NAMAs implementation will be used in the NDC and LT-
LEDS  implementation.  As  Thailand’s  LEDS  is  a  national  framework  on  climate  change 
mitigation, it is crucial that it is implemented in a methodical and holistic manner across 
sectors and levels.  
The implementation of Thailand’s LEDS will be in line with the timeframe of existing and 
subsequent NDCs. During 2021-2030, Thailand's LEDS will be implemented through the NDC 
roadmap and sectoral action plans which provide detailed guidance on measures and realistic 
actions to achieve the 1st NDC target by 2030, as well as regular monitoring and evaluation of 
the progress and achievement.  
The monitoring and evaluation of the mitigation measures relating to the Thailand’s LEDS will 
be carried out to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency in achieving its objectives and key 
performance indicators. Because it is a long-term plan spanning many years during which 
many changes can occur, it is envisaged that it will be subject to a comprehensive review 
every five years. This is consistent with the approach under the Paris Agreement that assigned 
Parties to submit their NDCs to the UNFCCC every five year. There is an opportunity to 
improve the alignment of LT-LEDS with the five-year revision cycles of NDC submission.  The 
review will provide a chance to reassess current policy pathways and new developments 
which may affect the range of possible ambition. Thailand will review the information and 
situation  regarding  the  implementation  of  the  national  strategy  along  with  relevant 
information available domestically and internationally to revise Thailand’s LEDS accordingly. 
The revision of Thailand’s LEDS can take into account the following factors:  
•  Trend and progress in the development of related technologies or the rapid decline 
in the investment cost of technologies 
•  The major changes in national strategy or related national policy direction  
•  The readiness of the line ministries and local administration  
•  Awareness, understanding and engagement among the various stakeholders 
•  Evaluation of the problems and obstacles to implementation 
47 
    
 
 
Consideration will also be given to any gaps or unmet needs that arise within the effort to 
reduce GHG emissions, which will be used to revise and refine the next phase of the plan. The 
implementation approach will be established to ensure a clear guideline for this monitoring 
and evaluation.  
Addressing climate change requires full engagement of all stakeholders and sectors, including 
government,  private  sector  and  civil  society  across  all  levels  of  administration  and 
organization.  They are key to the implementation of climate actions under Thailand’s LEDS. 
The development of practical tools and mechanisms which promote wider participation and 
collaboration will support building climate change resilience and contribute to low-carbon 
 
growth.
