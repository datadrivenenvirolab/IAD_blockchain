Climate change is identified as a crosscutting challenge because of the variety of stakeholders from the 
public and private sectors that interact, make decisions, and ultimately drive climate change mitigation 
and adaptation in the country. The country envisioned by the Strategy considers that society sectors such 
as non-governmental organizations or interest-based groups, together with private sector and the 
institutions and organizations from three levels of government play a role. Thus, the fight against climate 
change implies and requires dialogue, information generation and dissemination, and decision-making. 
The government has instruments that require recognizing regional, state, and local realities. To date, 
however, only one fourth of the Mexican states have completed their State Climate Change Programs; 
five states have enacted state legislation on climate change; and at the municipal level, the creation of 
climate change programs has begun. .................................................................................................. 24

Mexico’s  
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
 Prologue 
This is a pivotal moment in our history. The Paris Agreement is the foundation for a new 
paradigm of global action on climate change. We are in the middle of a transformative era 
of technology, demographics, and human behavior.  And we face energy, economic, and 
environmental challenges that are greater than those that we have conquered in the past. 
The twin goals of limiting temperature rise to well below 2ºC in this century and increasing 
global efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5ºC, pose an unprecedented opportunity 
to transform our economies.  To reach the Paris goal, we must plan ahead. Instead of 
reinventing our past, we can create our future where growth is uninhibited by fossil fuel 
constraints or health impacts; a future where growth does not come at the cost of future 
generations.   
Mexico assumes its responsibility as a global player.  Our Mid-century Climate Change 
Strategy will guide our actions as a nation for the next 40 years.  Built upon sound science, 
it poses feasible goals that go beyond reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  It sets out a long-
term vision and a roadmap to incorporate climate change in our development plans, thus 
impacting key strategic decision-making.  At the core of our strategy is the well being of our 
people, and the peoples of the world.  We aim to ensure their right to access clean energy, 
good health, and safe environments. The goal is for people to reach their full potential 
without impacting the planet. 
Our strategy is the product of a democratic exercise of society as a whole. Our actions have 
legal foundations, both on the climate and energy fronts.  The General Law on Climate Change 
provides the mandate to craft comprehensive long-term climate policy. The Energy Transition 
Law aims to fully revolutionize our energy sector for the adoption of new clean energy 
technologies  and  innovation.  We  have  launched  consultation  processes  for  both  our 
National  Climate  Change  Strategy  and  the  Energy  Transition  Strategy.    Our  Mid-Century 
Strategy builds on these processes and thus represents the will of the Mexican people. 
Mexico’s   1 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
In addition to our domestic efforts, Mexico has positioned itself as an international leader.  
In particular, I want to highlight our common efforts with the United States and Canada.  
With them, we have committed to an ambitious and enduring North American Climate, Clean 
Energy, and Environment Partnership that sets us firmly on the path to a more sustainable 
future. It is with them that we present today our Mid Century Strategy, based on the moral 
imperative  to  show  strong  regional  leadership  in  the  implementation  of  the  Paris 
Agreement. 
I  want  to  be  clear  that  global  efforts  must  be  strengthened.  The  totality  of  emissions 
reductions which have been pledged, as of today, are insufficient to meet the goal of limiting 
warming to 2ºC.  We must find ways to unlock finance, to build capacity in all regions of 
the  world,  and  to  accelerate  technology  deployment.    We  present  our  Strategy  and 
willingness to work with all Parties to find common solutions to raise global ambition.   
Climate change is the great unifier. It brings countries together, and calls for us to do more 
with less. It pulls together planning and investment that was otherwise separate and, at 
times, working at cross-purposes. There may be disagreement about how to do it, but what 
is clear is that we must achieve multiple goals in more effective ways than if we stayed in 
our  narrow  boxes.  We  must  overcome  the  way  we  divide  up  issue  areas  and  fail  to 
interweave common goals. 
We are Mexicans, and our Mid-Century Strategy outlines the roadmap for our future. It is 
rooted  firmly  on  past  lessons,  on  a  vision  based  on  science,  and  on  the  unwavering 
confidence in our ability to grasp and shape our destiny for the benefit of our children – and 
their children. While the challenge ahead is enormous, I am confident that together we have 
the creativity, ingenuity and political will to deliver on the promise of a safe climate future.

Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
Executive Summary 
 
Pursuant to Article 4 paragraph 19 of the Paris Agreement, Mexico submits its Mid-Century 
Strategy to the UNFCCC.  Mexico’s mid-century climate change strategy provides the 
vision,  principles,  goals,  and  main  lines  of  action  to  build  a  climate  resilient  society 
transition towards a low emissions development. This is in line with the global goal of 
holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2ºC, with additional 
efforts for the more ambitious 1.5ºC goal. This work also responds to a joint effort by the 
countries of the North American region, which committed to a North American Climate, Clean 
Energy, and Environment Partnership.  
First, in the Introduction we discuss our views about the importance of the MCS instrument 
of the Paris agreement. Together with the USA and Canada, we present strategies that call 
for deep greenhouse gas emissions reductions across the economy by 2050, emphasizing the 
importance of early, ambitious, and sustained action. Mexico encourages other Parties to 
develop their strategies, and welcomes cooperation in this area. 
Second, the Context chapter discusses the science, international and national conditions 
that drive our action.  First, we present a brief review of climate science regarding current 
GHGs  concentrations  and  emissions  reductions  required  to  reach  the  temperature 
stabilization  goal  of  the  Paris  Agreement.  Then,  we  briefly  discuss  international  and 
national actions.  Regarding domestic action, key elements of Mexico’s General Law on 
Climate Change are presented, including the institutional arrangements and instruments. 
Mexico’s Law already mandates the elaboration of a long-term climate change strategy, 
thus Mexico issued in 2013 the National Strategy for Climate Change 10-20-40, the basis of 
this document.   
Third, we present the Objective of our strategy. This document is a guiding instrument of 
the national climate change policy, both in the medium and long-term. As the guiding 
instrument,  it  describes  the  strategic  lines  of  action  guiding  policy  at  national  and 
subnational levels.  It also aims to encourage social participation and co-responsibility. The 
MCS does not intend to define concrete short-term actions. Mexico has other planning 
instruments that define short-term policies every six-year term (the Special Climate Change 
Program and State and Municipal Climate Change Programs.)  
Mexico’s   3  
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy   
  
Forth, we present Mexico’s long-term vision.  This exercise aims to define milestones for the 
next  10,  20  and  40  years  regarding  seven  important  areas  that  drive  emissions  and 
preparedness for the climate issue: society and population, ecosystems, energy, emissions, 
productive systems, private sector, and mobility.   
Fifth, we present the strategy for climate change adaptation.  Based on a vulnerability 
assessment, we present temperature and precipitation expected changes in Mexico in a 
RCP8.5 scenario.  With this scenario, we identify the most vulnerable municipalities of 
Mexico.  We briefly discuss actions taken to reduce vulnerability in the short-term horizon, 
and then the lines of action guiding the adaptation work in the long-term. We consider three 
main action areas: social, ecosystems and productive systems. 
Sixth, we present the strategy for climate mitigation.  Our GHG emissions reduction goal is 
to reduce 50% of national GHGs by 2050 below our emissions in 2000. We present results 
from a modeling exercise using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Economic Projection 
and Policy Analysis (EPPA) Model that was calibrated using Mexico’s information to evaluate 
two policy scenarios.  The first scenario refers to Mexico’s current unconditioned NDC 
emissions reduction goal of 22% reductions from baseline by 2030, with the goal of 50% 
reduction  by  2050.    The  second  scenario,  explores  a  more  ambitious  policy  of  36% 
reduction by 2030, with additional policies agreed at the regional level with the USA and 
Canada.  We quantified the additional emissions reduction by comparing scenarios. We 
also discuss indicative technology pathways coming out from the modeling exercise. We 
included in the analysis the analysis of all GHGs and also black carbon. Also, to support 
our analysis, we also present results from a detailed electricity sector model (the Balmorel 
model) and from a land-use model (Carbon Budget Model CBM-CFS3). 
The  policies  direct  action  in  five  important  areas:  the  clean  energy  transition,  energy 
efficiency and sustainable consumption, sustainable cities, reduction of short-lived climate 
pollutants  and  sustainable  agriculture  and  protection  of  natural  carbon  sinks.  Mexico’s 
strategy identifies critical crosscutting issues for long-term climate policy, including: the 
need for market-based instruments to price carbon, increased innovation, more research and 
development of new technologies, and the need to build a climate culture with mechanisms 
for social and private sector participation.   
Finally, we describe the evaluation and update process of the MCS strategy. Mexico’s 
General  Law  on  Climate  Change  requires  updating  at  least  once  every  ten  years  the 
mitigation and every six years the adaptation policies.  We commit to update our strategy 
according with the provisions agreed under the UNFCCC.  Our Strategy states that under 
no circumstances will the reviews lessen our goals and objectives.    
Mexico’s   4 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
Introduction 
 
In Paris, countries agree to take action with a long-term perspective. In particular, the Paris 
Agreement included in Article 4 the provision that countries should: 
“strive to formulate and communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies, 
mindful of Article 2 taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective 
capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances” 
And in accordance with Article 4, all Parties are invited to:   
 “communicate, by 2020, to the secretariat mid-century, long-term low greenhouse gas emission 
development strategies in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 19, of the Agreement, and requests the 
secretariat to publish on the UNFCCC website Parties’ low greenhouse gas emission development 
strategies as communicated” 
Pursuant to Article 4 and paragraph 19 of the Paris Agreement, Mexico submits its Mid-
Century Strategy (MCS) to the UNFCCC.  Our goal is to underscore the importance of this 
particular component of the Paris Agreement.  We believe that the MCS could provide 
important guidance to our future work, by aligning our short and medium term actions with 
the ultimate long-term objectives to protect our planet from dangerous climate change.  
As recognized in the Paris agreement, in order to reach the long-term temperature goal, 
global emissions must peak as soon as possible and rapid reductions must be undertaken 
thereafter.    As  of  today,  the  aggregate  effect  of  the  intended  nationally  determined 
contributions is insufficient to reach our climate goals (UNFCCC, 2016a). Thus, we must 
provide more ambition, and communicate our future plans to encourage more adaptation 
and mitigation action.  We believe that the submissions of MCS could assist our common 
goals, by helping us foresee the unfolding low-carbon world. We aim to generate confidence 
and transparency in the work ahead of us. 
In this spirit, we have worked with the US and Canada to submit our strategies during 
COP22.  We have identified areas of collaboration, including policies to accelerate clean 
energy deployment, efficient transportation and appliances, and to combat other GHG 
emissions such as methane. Our countries have identified the eminent need for innovation 
and more technology development. While more work is required to better integrate policies 
and efforts, our submissions today demonstrate our joint collaboration. We encourage other 
parties to develop their strategies, and welcome cooperation in this area.

Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy   
  
Context 
Science-based approach 
 
Earth warming is unequivocal. The average global surface temperature of the planet has 
increased  since  the  industrial  revolution,  more  notably  in  the  past  50  years.  Scientific 
evidence reviewed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shows, with 
a high level of confidence, that the observed changes in the climate system are significant 
and  very likely  driven  by  human  activities,  particularly  the  burning  of  fossil  fuels  and 
deforestation  (IPCC,  2014).  As  shown  in  Figure  1,  observed  changes  already  suggest 
alarming climate anomalies around the globe. Certain regions of the planet, specially the 
poles, surpassed 2ºC over their historical average. 
 
Figure 1 Observed change in surface temperature 1901-2012

The climate system depends on the balance of several internal and external factors. Among 
the external factors, solar radiation and orbit cycles stand out, while some of the internal 
factors are the atmosphere’s chemical composition and the water and carbon cycles. In 
particular, the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) since July 2016, have registered 
measurements of over 400 parts per million of CO  for three consecutive months (Earth 
2
Mexico’s   6  
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy   
  
System Research Laboratory, 2016) a threshold that scientists around the world consider 
already could lead to dangerous climate change (IPCC, 2013; Rockstrom et al., 2009). The 
state of our knowledge urges global action; we must immediately take measures both to 
minimize impacts of climate change and to mitigate emissions. 
Climate risks of a temperature increase of 2ºC or 3ºC above pre industrial levels include 
more  frequent  extreme  events,  such  as  droughts  and  heat  waves.  Also,  temperature 
increases above these levels could lead to changes in oceanic patterns. Scientists believe that 
current climate change trends could trigger a situation similar to the one occurred in the 
early Pliocene (between 3 to 5 million years ago), when the surface of the sea experienced 
high cyclonic activity (Fedorov, 2010).  As shown in Figure 2, current cyclone paths are 
limited to some tropical and subtropical zones of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. 
Climate  change  could  increase  cyclone-prone  areas  through  the  oceans  east  to  west. 
Furthermore, the cyclones might increase not only in number, but also in intensity. This 
would be similar to experiencing a constant El Niño effect, with important physical and 
human consequences.

Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
An unprecedented example of the potential of extreme weather events was experienced by 
Mexico in 2015.  Hurricane Patricia made history when it became the strongest storm 
recorded in the western Hemisphere; it was also one of the fastest strengthening storms ever 
recorded.  Such  rapid  intensification  could  be  explained  by  particular  environmental 
conditions;  namely  a  stable  atmosphere,  not  dry  air  intruding  into  the  storm  and  a 
particularly warm ocean layer.1 The water temperature anomaly could be one of the early 
signals of the global warming effect directly threatening the Mexican west coast. 
 
Figure 3 NASA astronaut Scott Kelly captured Hurricane Patricia from the International Space Station on Oct. 15, 2015

Thus, there is enough scientific evidence that not only is the planet warming, but also the 
impacts  of  temperature  rise  could  represent  important  risks  for  our  population.  
Acknowledging Mexico’s vulnerability to a changing climate, we are committed to act 
strongly and fast.   
Science also helps us to inform our global decision making on the size of the effort require to 
prevent  dangerous  anthropogenic  climate  change.   While  uncertainty  exists,  there  is 
agreement that the CO  concentration in the atmosphere most be stabilized in the range of

Ocean.

430-480  pmm  to  hold  the  temperature  below  2ºC.2 Based  on  this  information,  and  on 
available  information  regarding  consistent  emissions  pathways,  the  Paris  Agreement 
included two critical components for the global mitigation efforts.  Countries agreed that 
“global  emissions  must  peak  as  soon  as  possible”  and  that  “rapid  reductions  must  be 
undertaken thereafter.”  
 
Figure 4 Characteristics of below 2 °C and 1.5 °C pathways 
Source: (Schleussner et al., 2016) 
 
As Schleusneer et al discuss, there are both science and policy implications of the Paris 
Agreement temperature goal.  Figure 4 shows emissions pathways, resulting from integrated 
assessment  modeling  exercises,  which  could  be  consistent  with  a  2ºC  and  a  1.5ºC 
temperature  target  by  2100  (with  50%  probability)  (Schleussner  et  al.,  2016).    Their 
comparison of the 2ºC and 1.5ºC goals is illustrative of policy implications regarding timing 
for global emissions peak and also for the speed at which emissions should fall afterwards 
(See Figure 4a). Also, CO  emissions must be zero by 2050 for a 1.5ºC, and between 2050 
2
and 2070 for a 2ºC target (See Figure 4b.) 
To reach the aggressive level of emission reductions required, all mitigation options must be 
on the table. Mexico’s climate strategy includes measures to reduce Short-lived Climate 
Pollutants (SLCPs), including: black carbon (BC), methane (CH4), tropospheric ozone (O ), 
3
                                                
2 The IPCC considers that a range of 430-480 ppm would likely hold temperature rise below 2ºC; 
while ranges between 480-530 ppm could more likely than not achieve this goal if there is no overshoot 
over 530, and about as likely as not if there is an overshoot.

and some hydrofluorocarbons (HFC). Figure 5 illustrates the important role that SLCPs 
could have for climate mitigation. While contributing to reduce local air pollution, control 
strategies for SLCP could assist holding climate forcing in the short-term.

International Context 
 
After the Paris agreement the international setting for climate policy has now turn gears to 
full implementation and scaling-up action.  All Parties of the UNFCCC are now working to 
plan and look for adequate financing resources for their INDC.  As we focus in our short 
and medium term strategies to deliver on the NDC pledges, it is important that we align 
these actions to our overarching goals to protect the planet.  In this context, the MCS are a 
useful tool to signal to all interested communities (other Parties, social and private sectors, 
and the research community) what are long-term goals and strategic vision.  In this context, 
is that we present together with Canada and the US our MCS. Following, we present a brief 
overview of each of the North American countries MCS.  Areas of commonality can clearly 
be identified, and are an essential part of the North American Climate and Clean Energy 
Partnership, to mention clean energy deployment, energy efficiency, methane and short-
lived climate pollutants reduction, and protecting our forests and sensitive ecosystems. 
Mexico’s   10 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
Canada 
Canada’s mid-century low greenhouse gas emissions strategy outlines key principles and 
pathways consistent with Canada achieving net greenhouse gas emissions reductions in 
2050 that respect the 1.5-2°C global temperature goal. A few key factors are identified as 
paramount  to  low  GHG  outcomes  in  Canada:  non-emitting  electricity  generation;  the 
electrification of certain end-use applications; low-carbon fuels; energy efficiency; and the 
importance of sequestration from forests. The necessity of reducing non-carbon dioxide 
emissions  is  also  highlighted.  The  strategy  includes  the  key  message  that  significant 
emissions reductions are possible with today’s technology, while innovation and research 
and development will ease and accelerate the deployment of clean technologies and clean 
energy options – where the role of carbon pricing is paramount in this respect. Canada's 
strategy also links long term low greenhouse gas objectives to infrastructure and investment 
planning. 
Mexico 
Mexico’s mid-century climate change strategy provides the vision, principles, goals, and 
main  lines  of  action  to  build  a  climate  resilient  society  and  to  achieve  low  emissions 
development. This is in line with the global goal of holding the increase in the global 
average temperature to well below 2ºC, with additional efforts for the more ambitious 1.5ºC 
goal. The climate adaptation strategy, based on Mexico’s vulnerability assessment, identifies 
three main areas of action: reducing vulnerability factors and building social resilience, 
ecosystems-based  adaptation,  and  measures  to  protect  strategic  infrastructure  and 
production  systems.  Climate  mitigation  goals  are  aggressive,  and  direct  action  in  five 
important areas: the clean energy transition, energy efficiency and sustainable consumption, 
sustainable cities, reduction of short-lived climate pollutants and sustainable agriculture and 
protection of natural carbon sinks. Mexico’s strategy identifies critical crosscutting issues for 
long-term climate policy, including: the need for market-based approaches to price carbon, 
increased innovation, more research and development of new technologies, and the need to 
build a climate culture with mechanisms for social and private sector participation.  More 
broadly, Mexico’s long-term climate strategy aims to catalyze a profound transformation of 
our  economy.  This  transformation  will  address  the  climate  issue  as  well  as  national 
priorities of sustainable and more inclusive development, thereby contributing to building 
the Mexico we envision; that of a prosperous society that embraces the stewardship of

Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
USA 
The U.S. mid-century low greenhouse gas emissions strategy lays out multiple pathways for 
achieving  ambitious  reductions  of  domestic  net  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  2050, 
consistent with holding global average temperature increases to well below 2 °C. The U.S. 
strategy envisions actions across three categories: (1) the transformation to a low carbon 
energy system, including a near-complete decarbonization of the electricity grid and deep 
emissions reductions across the transportation, buildings and industrial sectors; (2) storing 
carbon and reducing emissions through U.S. lands and agriculture; and (3) reducing non-
CO  emissions such as methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases, despite large increases 
2
in key drivers of these emissions (e.g. agricultural production). To achieve a low GHG 
pathway, the U.S. strategy envisions an aggressive and cost-effective suite of public policies 
that  include  market  incentives  to  reduce  emissions  and  public  support  for  research, 
development, demonstration & deployment (RDD&D).  
National context 
 
Mexico  is  highly  vulnerable  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change.    Socioeconomic  and 
ecological trends, including the urbanization phenomena and pressures on natural resources 
due to economic and population growth, suggest that under a business as usual scenario the 
climate risk will compound other social and economic problems in the country. Therefore, 
climate change adaptation is essential for Mexico, and can also constitute an opportunity to 
reduce inequalities (Nations, 2016). 
 
Mexico is also an important player in terms of GHG emissions.  In 2013, Mexico emitted 
665 million tons of CO , ranking 12th in terms of countries contributing to global emissions 
2e
(INECC and SEMARNAT, 2015). While this corresponds only to 1.7% of emissions under 
the Paris Agreement covered emissions (UNFCCC, 2016b), the role of Mexico in climate 
mitigation is key as a developing country that has set aggressive targets and committed to 
enhance global mitigation efforts.   
Legal and Institutional Framework  
 
General Law on Climate Change  
Mexico’s General Climate Change Law (GLCC), issued in 2012, is the main climate policy 
instrument  in  the  country.3  The  GLCC  defines  planning  and  policy  instruments, 
                                                
3 Mexico was the second country to have a national climate change law, after the UK. 
Mexico’s   12 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
institutional arrangements, and provides general guidance for the implementation of climate 
policy.  It  also  incorporates  a  long-term,  systematic,  decentralized,  participatory  and 
integrated approach into adaptation and mitigation actions. Under the GLCC, the Federal 
Government  is  mandated  to  formulate  and  guide  national  climate  change  policy. 
Subnational governments role is also clearly specified, including the elaboration of State 
level  inventories  and  climate  programs.    The  GLCC  establishes  the  National  Climate 
Change System and provides policy principles that should be followed for climate policy 
design. 
National System for Climate Change  
 
Coordination  among  government  levels  is 
managed  through  the  National  Climate 
Change System.  At the federal level two 
important bodies were created to design and 
implement  climate  policy:  a)  the  Inter-
ministerial Commission on Climate Change 
(CICC),  b)  the  National  Institute  for 
Ecology and Climate Change (INECC).  To 
coordinate action at the subnational level, 
the Federal Congress is part of the NCCS, 
as  well  as  the  States  and  national 
associations of municipal officials.  Finally, 
to  advise  the  government,  the  Climate 
Change  Council  (C3)  was  created.  (See 
 
Figure 6)   Figure 6 National System for Climate Change 
The  CICC  is  a  body  of  13  Federal  Ministries:  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Natural 
Resources, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Finance and Public 
Credit, Ministry of Social Development, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of the Navy, 
Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries 
and Food, Ministry of Communications and Transportation, Ministry of Public Education, 
Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Tourism.4

Mexico’s   13 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
The CICC mandate includes: 1) to formulate and implement national policies on climate 
change mitigation and adaptation, by mainstreaming climate action in sector level programs 
and actions; 2) to develop criteria for the cross-cutting public climate change policies; 3) to 
approve the National Climate Change Strategy; and 4) to participate in the elaboration and 
implementation of the Special Climate Change Program (SCCP). 
The INECC is the research institute created by the GLCC to coordinate scientific and 
technology research and projects on climate change, with the assistance of public or private 
academic and research institutions, both national and foreign. It is the institution in charge 
of making prospective sector analysis and collaborating in the elaboration of strategies, 
plans, programs, and instruments related to climate change. Its work includes the estimation 
of future costs and benefits associated with the climate issue. Importantly, INECC has the 
mandate to design policies that can help build capacity in the country for climate change 
adaptation  and  mitigation.  Another  important  role  of  INECC  is  to  coordinate  the 
evaluation of climate policy.  The evaluation involves the participation of civil society 
advisors, and may be conducted through one or several independent organizations. 
The C3 is the permanent consultative body of the IMCC that is integrated by members from 
the social, academic, and private sectors, with renowned merit and experience in climate 
change. Some of its responsibilities include: 1) to advise the IMCC and provide them with 
recommendations to conduct studies, policies, actions, and goals to combat climate change, 
and 2) to promote social participation, through public consultation processes. 
Federal Congress, comprised by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, has different 
responsibilities to propose, discuss, and approve laws or amendments to existing legislation 
that lead to a reduction of greenhouse gases emissions, climate change mitigation, and 
adaptation  strategies.  In  the  Senate,  this  work  is  done  by  the  Special  Commission  on 
Climate Change and by the Commission on the Environment and Natural Resources. In the 
Chamber of Deputies the Climate Change Commission does this work. 
The functions of the States include:  
a)  Develop, conduct, and evaluate the state-level climate change policy. This can mean 
implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation actions in the following 
areas: preservation, restoration, management, and sustainable use of ecosystems and 
water  resources  within  their  own  jurisdictions;  food  security;  agriculture,  cattle 
ranching,  rural  development,  fishing,  and  aquaculture;  education;  efficient  and 
sustainable  infrastructure  and  transportation;  land-use  planning  of  human 
settlements and urban development; natural resources and environmental protection 
Mexico’s   14 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
within their own jurisdiction; hazardous waste; civil protection; and prevention of 
and attention to diseases resulting from the effects of climate change;  
b)  Develop  and  implement  their  own  climate  change  programs.  This  includes 
establishing monitoring and evaluation for: compliance with their climate change 
program, realization of goals, program effectiveness, and performance indicators for 
the mitigation and adaptation actions implemented;  
c)  Foster  scientific  and  technological  research  and  the  development,  transfer,  and 
deployment of technologies, equipment, and processes for climate change mitigation 
and adaptation;  
d)  Develop comprehensive greenhouse gas mitigation strategies, programs, and projects 
in order to promote efficient and sustainable public and private transportation;  
e)  Process  and  integrate  state-level  emission  source  data  for  incorporation  into  the 
National Emissions Inventory and the state risk atlas. 
 
National  Association  of  Municipal  Officials  is  composed  of  the  Mexican  National 
Confederation of Municipalities, the Mexican Association of Local Authorities, and the 
National Association of Mayors. 
The functions of the municipalities include:  
a)  Develop,  conduct,  and  evaluate  municipal  climate  change  policy.  This  means 
implementing policies and actions to combat climate change in the following ways: 
provision  of  potable  water  and  sanitation  services;  local  ecological  and  urban 
planning;  local  natural  resource  and  environmental  protection;  civil  protection; 
management of municipal solid waste  
b)  Foster  scientific  and  technological  research  and  the  development,  transfer,  and 
deployment of technologies, equipment, and processes for climate change mitigation 
and adaptation;  
c)  Develop  comprehensive  strategies,  programs,  and  projects  on  climate  change 
mitigation  in  order  to  promote  efficient  and  sustainable  public  and  private 
transportation;  
d)  Participate in the design and implementation of incentives and;  
e)  Process and integrate municipal-level emissions source data for incorporation into 
the National Emissions Inventory. 
 
Policy instruments and principles 
The GLCC establishes 3 main climate-planning instruments:  
a)  The National Climate Change Strategy: provides the long-term vision for the country 
with a time horizon of 10, 20 and 40 years.   
Mexico’s   15 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
b)  Special Climate Change Program: incorporates the planning for each administration, 
considering specific programs, goals and resources.  
c)  State Climate Change Programs: incorporates the planning of each state, considering 
their specific competences, resources and climate state level regulations.  
 
In addition to the guiding and planning instruments, the GLCC defines specific policy 
instruments  on  financing,  market  instruments,  policy  evaluation,  and  enforcement  to 
produce  critical  information,  incentivize  and  mandate  mitigation  action  in  line  with 
national  mitigation  targets,  and  reduce  vulnerability  and  increase  resilience  of  strategic 
infrastructure, economic activities and that of society at large. 
 
Figure 7 Climate Change Institutional Arrangements and Policy Instruments 
Source: (SEMARNAT, 2013a) 
 
Regarding  information,  the  GLCC  mandates  INECC  to  elaborate  the  National  GHG 
Emissions Inventory, an essential input for domestic policy design and for international 
reporting.  Also as an information instrument, the National Emissions Registry is created 
under the law, with a specific mandate for industries and other sources to report emissions 
and  quantified  mitigation  actions.  The  Climate  Change  Information  System  was  also 
established  under  the  GLCC  to  collect,  integrate  and  make  publicly  available  all 
information considered of “national interest”, including the national GHG inventory and 
other information, such as the vulnerability atlas.   
On financing, the GLCC provides the legal basis for market-based instruments, such as 
emissions trading and  carbon taxes. It also creates the Climate Change Fund,  to  help 
finance climate projects in the country.  Regulatory instruments are also included in the law, 
particularly emissions limits standards and efficiency standards and regulations. Figure 7 
summarizes the institutional arrangements and instruments set by the GLCC. 
Mexico’s   16

Mexico’s   17 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
 
 
Objective 
 
The National Climate Change Strategy is the guiding instrument of the national climate 
change policy, both in the medium and long-term, to face the impacts of climate change and 
to  transition  towards  a  competitive,  sustainable  low-carbon  economy.  As  the  guiding 
instrument and based on best available information, it describes the strategic lines of action 
guiding  policies  of  the  three  government  levels.    It  also  aims  to  encourage  social 
participation and co-responsibility. More broadly, the long-term climate strategy aims to 
address climate change along with national priorities, and to contribute in building the 
Mexico we envision in the long-term. 
Scope 
 
The Strategy does not intend to define concrete short-term actions or specific responsible 
federal institutions. At the federal level, the Special Climate Change Program will define, for 
each six-year term, the objectives and specific actions for mitigation and adaptation, as well 
as allocate human and financial resources to achieve these goals. State and Municipal 
Climate Change Programs at the local level will similarly describe specific plans of action 
for the short-term. 
The medium and long-term goals will be achieved through the instrumentation of all GCCL 
planning  instruments,  the  effective  operation  of  the  institutional  framework,  the 
development of economic instruments and other instruments, including regulatory technical 
standards.  All instruments should be aligned with the ultimate goals of this Strategy. 
Elaboration process 
 
The  technical  and  scientific  inputs  have  been  provided  mainly  by  INECC,  and  other 
research centers across the country. The Strategy has been elaborated by SEMARNAT, 
with the participation of the INECC. It has been enriched with contributions from every 
Mexico’s   18 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
federal institution within the CICC and with contributions gathered in bilateral meetings 
with climate change areas of the federal government. The Strategy was also reinforced 
through an ample participative and consultative process. Firstly, inputs were received from 
Core Advisory Councils on Sustainable Development in all states. 5 Secondly, input was 
also received from a workshop carried out in Mexico City with over 80 experts from the 
organized  civil  society,  the  academic  community,  and  the  private  sector.  Thirdly,  a 
nationwide  online  consultation  process  was  carried  out.  In  addition,  important 
contributions by the Climate Change Council were considered in Strategy. 
Structure 
 
The Strategy contains 6 cross cutting issues that set the foundation of climate policy in the 
country, both for adaptation and mitigation.  Then, it delves into our adaptation three 
specific  strategic  lines  of  action,  considering  Mexico’s  vulnerability  assessment  and  an 
ecosystem-based  adaptation  approach.  Thirdly,  it  presents  Mexico’s  lines  of  action 
envisioned for a transition towards a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development.  
This strategy has five main lines of action, including plans for the clean energy transition, 
energy efficiency and sustainable consumption, sustainable cities, agriculture and forestry 
mitigation, and action to reduce Short-lived Climate Pollutants (SLCP). Figure 8 presents a 
snapshot of Mexico’s Strategy. 
 
Both  adaptation  and  mitigation  sections  include  prioritization  criteria.  Considering  the 
limited resources for policy implementation, these criteria are expected to guide decision-
makers to maximize benefits.

Long-term vision 
 
Mexico experiences sustainable development and low-emissions growth through an efficient 
management of natural resources and the use of clean and clean energy resources.  Mexico 
is a thriving, competitive, socially inclusive, and globally responsible country.  The Mexican 
population has rewarding and well-paid jobs, and especially the most vulnerable population 
has advancement opportunities.  Mexico has a climate resilient society and ecosystems, 
sustainable cities, and a green economy. Table 1 describes the milestones for the next 10, 20, 
and 40 years to build our envisioned country.

Mexico’s   23 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
Cross-cutting policies  
 
Inter-institutional collaboration 
 
Climate  change  is  identified  as  a  crosscutting  challenge  because  of  the  variety  of 
stakeholders  from  the  public  and  private  sectors  that  interact,  make  decisions,  and 
ultimately drive climate change mitigation and adaptation in the country. The country 
envisioned  by  the  Strategy  considers  that  society  sectors  such  as  non-governmental 
organizations or interest-based groups, together with private sector and the institutions and 
organizations from three levels of government play a role. Thus, the fight against climate 
change  implies  and  requires  dialogue,  information  generation  and  dissemination,  and 
decision-making. The government has instruments that require recognizing regional, state, 
and local realities. To date, however, only one fourth of the Mexican states have completed 
their State Climate Change Programs; five states have enacted state legislation on climate 
change; and at the municipal level, the creation of climate change programs has begun. 
Market-based instruments 
 
To  tackle  climate  change,  Mexico  needs  accessible,  timely,  and  sufficient  economic 
resources that allow for timely and decisive action on mitigation of and adaptation to 
climate change. The limited resources of the country – while facing a diversity of challenges 
– force us towards more efficient planning and execution. On that regard, Mexico has been 
exploring different market-based instruments to support policy implementation and action 
on climate change. One instrument is a carbon tax. As a fiscal instrument, Mexico’s carbon 
tax aims to induce a reduction in the importation and commercialization of fossil fuels. He 
tax assigns a price per unit of fuel and exempts natural gas, as a way to create an incentive 
to switch from more to less carbon intensive fuels. The tax has adopted as fiscal instrument 
in 2014.   
In addition to the carbon tax, Mexico is exploring the development of a cap and trade 
system  that  would  provide  the  means  for  cost-effective  emission  reductions  in  certain 
economic activities. The development of the technical and regulatory components of such a 
system is under way. In addition, Mexico has been collaborating with other governments for 
the  development  of  an  offsets  generation  and  validation  system  particularly  for  those 
Mexico’s   24 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
activities or sectors that may not be incorporated into a cap and trade system but that may 
equally contribute to mitigation actions that also support adaptation to climate change. 
Innovation, research & development and technology adoption 
 
Science-based  action  to  limit  climate  change  implies  knowledge,  innovation,  and 
technology. Applying knowledge through the use of science, technological innovation, and 
education will protect and enhance sustainable development. Research on climate change is 
relatively new in Mexico. Therefore, building knowledge and awareness around this topic 
has become extremely significant and requires an ongoing dedication from the three levels 
of government, academic institutions (universities and research networks, among others), 
the private sector, and society as a whole. 
Training  of 
professionals  that 
understand  and  act 
on  climate  change 
requires  a 
transformation of the 
courses  and 
programs  of  study 
used  by  public  and 
private  universities, 
technical  colleges 
and  other  education   
Illustration 1 Mexican Energy Innovation Centers

country. The content 
of what it thought and learned must clearly consider the causes and implications of climate 
change, and must drive research and development, and become an incentive for innovation 
and  technology  development  and  adoption.  Some  support  programs  for  innovation, 
research and development on climate change exist in Mexico, but must be upgraded and 
enhanced,  and  their  number  and  funding  increased.  Research  programs  that  address 
national needs on mitigation and adaptation must be created and supported, to complement 
the spectrum of what exists in public and private organizations such as INECC, IMTA, 
Mexico’s   25 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
INEL6, or others. Efforts are also being carried out to promote adaptation actions and to 
strengthen  mitigation  actions.  However,  we  need  to  integrate  the  research  on  climate 
change  effects  in  a  single  platform  to  facilitate  its  accessibility  and  use.  Similarly  the 
development of mitigation technology and the identification of best practices is a matter of 
utmost importance. This will result in the generation, spreading, integration and use of 
climate  change  knowledge  towards  different  regions  of  the  country.  Knowledge 
requirements  include:  research  on  habitat  fragmentation  through  land  management; 
vulnerability assessment of the population; identification of infrastructure projects; private 
sector equipment to improve adaptation; private sector related research; the diffusion of 
technologies  to  measure  climate  parameters;  clean  energy  production  accompanied  by 
patent generation; and waste management, among others. 
Building a climate culture 
 
Mexico  has  a  growing  population 
that  is  increasingly  diverse  and 
dynamic, producing and demanding 
intellectual,  cultural,  and  scientific 
resources. Education and knowledge 
are indispensable tools for citizens to 
exercise  their  rights,  acknowledge 
their  responsibilities,  and  become 
capable  of  well-informed  decision-
making  in  everyday  life.  In  our 
country,  the  scope  of  basic  level 
schooling  is  practically  universal, 
which makes it an effective vehicle 
for  spreading  climate  change 
awareness.  Moreover,  elementary 
and  middle  level  schools  already 
teach  principles  of  environmental

education. Training programs about  National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change

sustainability  and  climate  change   
have been implemented in the private, social, and academic sectors. A few products and

services already inform consumers of their ecologic footprint. Alas, those that account for 
and inform their users about life-cycle emissions are few and far between. 
A study conducted between 2009 and 2012 to measure climate change perception levels 
among citizens (CECADESU, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012) provided a first glimpse of how 
climate change is understood in Mexico.7 In 2009, 87% of the polled population said they 
were concerned about climate change; in 2012, almost 97% of the polled people expressed 
they were very, somehow, or a little concerned about climate change, and only less than 4% 
said  they  were  not  worried  at  all.  These  results  show  that  the  Mexican  population  is 
concerned about the matter. This strategy’s proposed lines of action will serve as guides for 
citizens to cooperatively protect the environment and act on climate change. 
Social participation 
 
This strategy emphasizes the 10th principle of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and 
Development:  
“Environmental  issues  are  best  handled  with  the  participation  of  all 
concerned  citizens,  at  the  relevant  level.  At  the  national  level,  each 
individual  shall  have  appropriate  access  to  information  concerning  the 
environment that is held by public authorities […] and the opportunity to 
participate  in  decision-making  processes.  States  shall  facilitate  and 
encourage public awareness and participation by making information widely 
available.  Effective  access  to  judicial  and  administrative  proceedings, 
including redress and remedy, shall be provided.” 
The  introduction  of  “environmental  responsibility”  to  our  Constitution  –  through  an 
amendment to article 4 in February 2012 – along with the approval of the Environmental 
Responsibility Federal Law in April 2013 – strengthens environmental law in Mexico. 
These amendments allow individuals to access the national justice system to demand the 
remedy of environmental damage.8

Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) 
 
A system for Measurement, Reporting, and Verification, along with that for Monitoring and 
Evaluation, help us ensure transparency, whilst also guaranteeing environmental integrity, 
comparability, consistency, and data accuracy. Their development and use reinforce the 
quality  of  adaptation  and  mitigation  actions,  and  are  fundamental  in  the  design, 
implementation, and evaluation of the national climate change policy. Mexico has actively 
participated  in  the  setting  of  international  criteria  that  define  the  use  and  scope  of 
methodologies for MRV of mitigation actions and M&E of adaptation measures. We have 
also begun training to incorporate MRV and M&E into national activities against climate 
change. Regarding this national strategy, the GCCL mandates that the national climate 
change policy be based upon essential MRV and M&E activities. Thus, the three levels of 
government must actively incorporate these criteria in public policy.

International leadership 
 
Mexico has positioned itself as a key actor among developing countries, and among those 
countries committed to effectively combatting of climate change. The country is a party of 
the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. Additionally, Mexico served as president and host of 
COP  16  in  2010,  and  participates  in  other  institutions  and  international  organizations 
related to climate change. Our active participation in negotiations to secure and improve the 
international  response  to  climate  change  is  a  reflection  of  the  values  of  the  people  of 
Mexico. This has resulted in a unique leadership position. We have been able to strengthen 
climate  change  action  within  Latin  America  and  the  Caribbean  through  South-South 
cooperation. 
Mexico aspires to maintain and increase its leadership role, whilst seeking to translate it into 
the achievement of more and better global agreements. For that, we will position ourselves 
as a key actor in the region, and we will serve as a bridge to other developing countries. A 
solid national commitment will signal a congruent stance towards solving problems faced by 
the international community whilst fighting climate change. 
This topic has gained prominence in Mexico. However, it is necessary to reinforce past 
achievements and to generate better results in the future through the exploration of new 
ways of implementing public policies which reach the whole population. Remaining tasks 
consist of improved coordination between the different branches of government and their 
Mexico’s   29 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
institutions. This coordination must then be expanded to the rest of society. This will be 
achieved by: implementing new governance systems, greater public participation, and the 
generation of a strong sense of shared responsibility which will lead to the establishment of 
useful institutional agreements to combat climate change. In next few years, Mexico must 
set standards that allow for the lines of action proposed in this strategy to be implemented in 
a coordinated, coherent, cross-cutting manner in order to achieve the objectives set for the 
country.  Therefore,  the  pillars  of  the  national  climate  change  policy  constitute  the 
cornerstone of this National Climate Change Strategy. 
Lines of action 
 
Inter-institutional collaboration 
The effective implementation of national climate change policy requires crosscutting 
coordination between sectors and actors, the revision of the judicial framework in order to 
avoid opposition, and the inclusion of all social groups. The participation of these actors is 
indispensable for the execution of adaptation and mitigation policies and actions posed in 
the National Climate Change Strategy 
•  To integrate objectives and goals for climate change adaptation and mitigation into 
the National, State and municipal level plans and programs.  
•  To implement the National Climate Change System as a coordination mechanism 
between public, private, and social sectors, and as a platform for articulated planning 
between branches of government.  
•  To encourage the involvement of academic, private, and social sectors through the 
Climate Change Council to inform the CICC decision-making 
•  To harmonize and strengthen the current legal framework, incorporating climate 
change criteria throughout the coordination the branches of government.  
•  To promote individuals’ access to environmental justice and remediation of 
environmental damage whenever possible, or else equivalent improvements in 
priority zones for climate change.    
•  To consolidate the climate change institutional framework through intersectoral, 
crosscutting agreements, and the creation of climate change specific areas and local 
advisory groups, among others, within all levels of government and sectors of 
society.  
•  To consider gender, ethnicity, disability, inequality, wellbeing, and inequity whilst 
designing climate change policies, as well as the involvement of different sectors of 
society in their implementation. Wherever relevant, introduce the principle of “free, 
prior, and informed consent”.  
Mexico’s   30 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
•  To implement intersectoral mitigation and adaptation actions through the 
coordination and cooperation between federal institutions, public actors, and private 
actors. 
•  To guarantee the integration of climate change adaptation and mitigation criteria in 
political instruments such as: the evaluation of environmental impacts; general, state, 
and municipal land-use planning; ecological marine planning, and land-use planning 
for tourism and urban development. 
•  To align land-use planning, urban development, sustainable buildings, housing, 
energy, transport, mobility, green areas, coastlines, comprehensive waste 
management, and water policies, in order to reduce the carbon footprint of human 
settlements.  
•  To guarantee crosscutting integration of water-related criteria in the formulation and 
implementation of climate change policies.  
•  To guarantee the coherence between climate change and rural sustainable 
development policies, programs, and institutional agreements regarding deforestation 
and woodland degradation as a multifactorial problem in the three government 
levels.  
•  To introduce climate change criteria for articulating and improving legislation, 
policies, and instruments that promote sustainable forest management.  
•  To encourage inter-state and inter-municipal associations of producers and other 
technical public agents towards environmental management that is coherent at a 
landscape unit level.  
•  To create and strengthen local institutions for the regulation and planning of regional 
and metropolitan transportation, particularly in terms of mobility, infrastructure 
optimization, transportation routes, and maximized efficiency.  
•  To guarantee the consistency between instruments and programs of the agriculture, 
fishing, forestry, and urban sectors, in order to achieve synergies between adaptation 
and mitigation, and to avoid contradictory policy.  
•  To encourage the evaluation of environmental impacts in sectoral programs and 
projects.  
•  To strengthen existent epidemiological surveillance systems and to include the 
following in the design of actions for epidemiological attention: climate change 
related health impacts such as infectious intestinal disease; acute respiratory 
infections; food-poisoning related to phenomena like red tide; and attention to 
populations affected by disasters as hurricanes and flooding.  
 
Market-based instruments 
To effectively implement actions against climate change, we need accessible, timely, and 
sufficient economic resources. Simultaneously, economic signals need to be sent to reflect 
the cost of environmental damage caused by greenhouse gases. Mexico can increase the use 
Mexico’s   31 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
of  market-based  instruments.  The  development  of  climate-specific  fiscal  policies  and 
economic  instruments  will  promote  a  low-emission  economic  development  and  will 
increase our global competitiveness. 
•  To design a national policy of economic, fiscal, financial, and market-based 
instruments in order to incentivize mitigation and adaptation actions, including: the 
use of targeted subsidies, the elimination or decoupling of inefficient subsidies, and 
the creation of both public and private financial instruments.  
•  To establish the mechanisms needed to turn the National Climate Change Fund into 
an efficient and effective platform for channeling resources, including those of 
international origin.  
•  To assign enough budgetary resources to execute adaptation and mitigation actions, 
and to allocate them in federal, state, and municipal budgets.  
•  To articulate bring together national funds and other financial sources in order to 
foster climate change actions.  
•  To ensure that economic and financial resources are directed towards priority 
climate actions, including the consideration of social and environmental safeguards.   
•  To promote sustainable production in the country through the use of economic 
incentives.  
•  To favour the funding of national research and technology development for climate 
change adaptation and mitigation.  
•  To encourage new economic and financial mechanisms, including NAMAs and 
possible emissions markets, in order to incentivize mitigation actions.  
•  To define energy prices according to a life cycle analysis that considers externalities, 
including the cost of greenhouse emissions.  
•  To redefine the current energy and water subsidies structure in order to increase 
efficiency both in power and water consumption.  
•  To gradually adjust residential electricity and water prices to more accurate prices, 
compensating the vulnerable groups through targeted measures. 
•  To redirect fossil fuel subsidies in order to strengthen sustainable, efficient, and safe 
public transportation such as the railway system, among others.  
•  To guarantee the incorporation of climate change criteria in development bank 
guidelines for favoring projects that involve renewable and clean energies, and that 
promote the transition towards less carbon-intensive technologies.  
•  To encourage a mechanism to promote voluntary carbon markets, including forest 
carbon offset credits.  
•  To identify, strengthen or create specific economic and financial instruments that 
incentivize the restoration, conservation, sustainable use, and resilience of 
ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide.  
•  To design and adjust economic and financial instruments and incentives for 
REDD+, whilst guaranteeing a fair and equitable distribution of the benefits 
obtained for avoiding emissions.  
Mexico’s   32 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
•  To consolidate the participation of social and private sectors in financial and market-
based mechanisms which promote climate change adaptation and mitigation.  
 
Innovation, research & development and technology adoption 
In  order  to  make  the  right  choices  for  climate  change  abatement  and  adaptation,  our 
country needs to produce scientific and technological knowledge which can be shared. This 
will create synergies, promote collaboration and avoid duplicity. Technological innovation 
will  permit  the  development  of  new  production  capacities  as  well  as  the  recovery  of 
economic resources. Simultaneously, Mexico needs to create national capacities in the three 
government branches through training in priority adaptation and mitigation opportunities. 
Training  decision-makers  as  a  base  for  the  formulation  of  policy  will  promote  climate 
change awareness and successful policy application. 
•  To create and operate an information platform in order to make publicly available 
the advances in the climate change national research.  
•  To conduct national, regional, and local research, as well as developing 
technological exchange and development platforms in order to communicate state, 
municipal, and regional priorities. 
•  To establish consortiums for research, development, and innovation in low-emission 
services and technologies.  
•  To generate mechanisms so that every governmental and social actor can make 
decisions founded on scientific information and climate change knowledge.  
•  To promote climate change-related scientific and technological research studies and 
projects within a state, regional or municipal scope through research groups. These 
research groups will include an effective coordination between academia, the public 
sector, the private sector, national research institutions, and international 
institutions.  
•  To identify, organize, analyze, and disseminate existing climate change knowledge 
in the country, according to national requirements, in order to serve as the 
foundation of the national climate change policy.  
•  To encourage research and technological innovation on assessing vulnerability and 
designing adaptation measures, by region, ecosystems, population settlements, 
equipment and infrastructure, production sectors, and social groups; in order for the 
country infrastructure to be prepared for the risks of disasters caused by climate 
change. The technological innovation will also   lead to Mexico becoming an 
emergent power in the following years.  
•  To ensure academic-private sector collaboration for development and transfer of 
technology for reducing and controlling greenhouse gases.  
Mexico’s   33 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
•  To encourage research, development and national integration of advanced 
technologies for generating renewable, clean energy such as tidal, solar, hydrogen, 
and biofuel energy sources, among others.  
•  To encourage technology improvement for monitoring meteorological, 
climatological, and hydrometric conditions.  
•  To identify, organize, and analyze existing climate change information in the 
country, particularly on adaptation. This analysis will focus  research on industries 
facing climate risks such as droughts and hurricanes 
•  Too define the country’s infrastructurevulnerability  and to generate building and 
urban planning regulations which allow for ecologically-resilient land-use planning. 
•  To produce national research for understanding and forecasting climate change and 
its impacts in Mexico.  
•  To create and strengthen coordination, collaboration and networking that integrate 
and make the most of the local knowledge.  
•  To create and strengthen climate change training schemes in the three levels of 
government, as well as in the Legislative and Judicial Branches.  
•  To strengthen capacities ithroughout government in order to gain access to both 
national and international financial sources.  
•  To train different government branches in the use of effective planning instruments 
for mitigation and adaptation.  
•  To strengthen the capacities for land management on a landscape unit level, by 
creating, for example, local technical agents, local development agents and new 
spaces for collaborative management agents.  
•  To train those responsible for budget assignment in government on climate change, 
with a special focus on the importance of allocating funds to adaptation, disaster 
prevention and mitigation actions.  
•  To create institutional capacities for establishing mechanisms and procedures to 
measure, report, verify, monitor, and evaluate mitigation and adaptation actions. 
•  To encourage the development of a strategy for connectivity and complementarity 
among terrestrial, coastal, and marine ecosystems. This will result in well-managed 
regional ecological processes and promote state and municipal natural protected 
areas.  
•  To build capacity for research and technological innovation on SLCPs and their 
warming potential, in order to identify local and national actions that could be 
included in mitigation strategies due to its co-benefits.  
 
Building a climate culture 
The climate challenge mandates a transformation of production and consumption patterns. 
To do so, Mexico requires a civically engaged society that demands accountability from the 
Mexico’s   34 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
government. Educational programs and effective knowledge diffusion are fundamental to 
successfully implement such a transcendent policy. 
•  To induce a change towards sustainable consumption and production patterns 
through massive communication campaigns and training programs which educate, 
inform and raise awareness..  
•  To offer educational projects focused on climate change for elementary schools, 
middle schools, and beyond.This will form a recognition of climate change as a 
problem which can be overcome.  
•  To encourage  social participation in the formulation, implementation, and 
surveillance of the national climate change policy.  
•  To encourage government accountability on climate change from by effectively 
disseminating national climate change policy and the associated results.  
•  To enact consumer regulations to obtain timely and relevant information on 
emissions resulting from production and consumption of goods and services 
available in the market. 
•  To use technology to keep the public informed about the climate change situation in 
the country, greenhouse gas emissions inventories, the National Emissions Registry, 
and the Climate Change Information System.  
•  To design and enforce an effective communication strategy for every sector of society 
according to the appropriate context, be it cultural, economic, political, ethnic, or 
gender-related. 
 
Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) 
Climate change mitigation and adaptation actions require the development of greenhouse 
gas  Measurement,  Reporting  and  Verification,  as  well  as  Monitoring  and  Evaluation 
instruments.  These  instruments  provide  transparency  and  certainty  to  actions,  whilst 
guaranteeing environmental integrity, comparability, consistency, transparency and data 
accuracy. MRV in particular will allow for evaluation and feedback to inform climate 
change  policies.  This  emissions  data  will  also  improve  policy  efficiency  and  impact. 
Particularly, the correct and efficient use of resources will directly impact the achievement 
of national adaptation and mitigation policy objectives . 
•  To implement Measurement, Reporting and Verification, as well as Monitoring and 
Evaluation instruments for mitigation and adaptation measures.  
•  To develop an M&E system for public policies including climate change adaptation 
criteria and indicators.  
•  To measure, report and verify the source, use and results of international, private, 
and public support resources for tackling climate change in Mexico. 
Mexico’s   35 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
•  To gradually strengthen verification mechanisms according to the type of measure 
and financial impacts. 
•  To provide information about emissions, reductions and potential carbon market 
transactions from stationary and mobile sources reporting to the National Emissions 
Registry.  
•  To transparently establish and update emissions inventories, national and sector 
baselines and mitigation trajectories in order to monitor evaluate mitigation policies.  
•  To establish mechanisms for ensuring that recommendations from the Evaluation 
Committee are considered and, where appropriate, reflected in the national climate 
change policy. 
•  To establish and develop transparent methodologies for the measurement, 
monitoring, verification and reporting of mitigation actions.  
•  To develop a national forestry monitoring system for the transparent and rigorous 
monitoring, reporting, and verification of mitigation actions in the forestry sector.  
•  To develop and maintain a national information system for safeguards related to the 
implementation of REDD+ actions. This will ensure implementation of the 
safeguards and provide a grievance system. 
•  To establish mechanisms for measuring financial, human, and ecological risks 
related to diverse climate effects in all economic sectors and regions of the country. 
•  To strengthen the design of climate change related health indicators. This includes 
analyzing environmental, labor, and social factors to provide updated information to 
the National Epidemiologic Surveillance System. That system will carry out 
preventative and reactive actions to protect vulnerable populations.  
 
International leadership 
With these efforts, we aim to maintain and strengthen Mexico’s position as a relevant actor 
in the international arena, as well as in the Latin American and Caribbean region. This 
positioning will incorporate recognition of our high vulnerability to climate change, and our 
potential for greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. This position may result in international 
climate funding and strengthened bilateral and regional cooperation. 
•  To contribute to global efforts towards strengthening climate change action within 
the United Nations, seeking to increase the level of ambition, and seeingparticipation 
from all countries.  
•  To promote and benefit from the implementation of additional efforts in mitigation 
and adaptation within the framework of multilateral, regional, or bilateral processes 
complementary to the UNFCCC.  
•  To promote opportunities for bilateral cooperation and sharing of experiences and 
best practices within a South-South cooperation framework.  
Mexico’s   36 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
•  To maintain a proactive presence in international climate change negotiations. This 
presence will be based on an inclusive national dialogue. 
•  To position Mexico in the international arena by increasing its level of ambition in 
regards to mitigation and its need for adaptation. This is especially important due to 
Mexico’s elevated climate vulnerability.  
•  To identify and promote access to international climate funding sources. These 
sources should permit recipient countries to define specific mitigation and adaptation 
actions..  
•  To capitalize on synergies between the three Rio conventions (the Convention on 
Biological Diversity, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, and 
the UNFCCC) in order to enhance their impact. 
•  To consistently link Mexico’s international climate change position to national 
actions. 
 
Mexico’s   37 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
Climate change adaptation 
 
The Special Climate Change Program SCCP 2014-2018 (PECC 2014-2018 in Spanish) is 
one of the planning instruments of the Climate Change General Law and is aligned to the 
National  Development  Plan  and  related  programs,  as  well  as  to  the  Climate  Change 
National Strategy: 10-20-40 Vision, and to the sector programs of the 14 Secretariats or 
Ministries. 
The  Secretariats  that  participated  in  the  development  of  the  PECC  2014-2018  were: 
Environment and Natural Resources; Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries 
and  Food;  Health;  Communications  and  Transportation;  Economy;  Tourism;  Social 
Development; State Department; Naval; Energy; Public Education; Treasury and Public 
Credit; Foreign Affairs; and Rural, Land, and Urban Development. 
In the PECC 2014-2018, the adaptation section describes the objective of reducing the 
vulnerability of the populations and the productive sectors, as well as to preserve and protect 
ecosystems  and  environmental  services,  and  increase  resistance  of  the  strategic 
infrastructure to the adverse impacts of climate change. It also presents the contribution of 
the Federal Public Administration for the 2014-2018 period to meet the objective set for 
2020 of reducing by 30% the Greenhouse Gases (GHG) with respect to a trend scenario. To 
reach the objectives set by Mexico on climate change mitigation and adaptation, however, it 
is essential to have the contribution of all states and municipalities, the private sector, and 
the society at large. 
The Program includes 5 objectives, 26 strategies and 199 lines of action, of which 77 lines of 
action  correspond  to  climate  change  adaptation,  81  to  mitigation,  and  41  to  the 
development of a governmental policies in these matters.  
The assessment section related to adaptation includes information on the impacts that the 
population, the ecosystems, productive sectors, and infrastructure are and would be exposed 
to as a result of climate change. It also presents data of the economic impact due to extreme 
hydrometeorological events from 2009 to date, as well as the asymmetry in public financial 
support between prevention and attention of disasters during the period 2005-2011. 
 
Mexico’s   38 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
Likewise,  the  assessment  identifies  those  municipalities  with  a  higher  vulnerability  to 
climate change in Mexico. 
Aligning  with  those  national  guidelines,  Mexico  included  in  the  INDC  an  adaptation 
component with unconditional and conditional commitments by 2030. Priority actions are: 
the protection of the population from adverse impacts of climate change, such as extreme 
hydrometeorological events; as well as to increase the resilience of strategic infrastructure 
and ecosystems. In order to reach these adaptation priorities Mexico will strengthen the 
adaptive capacity of at least 50% the number of municipalities in the category of “most 
vulnerable”,  establish  early  warning  systems  and  risk  management  at  every  level  of 
government and reach a rate of 0% deforestation by the year 2030. 
These unconditional commitments are grouped into three sections: social sector, ecosystem-
based adaptation, and strategic infrastructure and productive systems. 
 
Vulnerability assessment 
 
Mexico has geographical characteristics that make it a highly vulnerable country to climate 
change impacts. Its location between two oceans, and its latitude and topography increase 
the country´s the exposure to extreme hydrometeorological phenomena. 
Mexico has become warmer since the 1960s (MET Office Hadley Centre, 2012). Average 
temperatures  nationwide  have  risen  0.85°C,  which  coincides  with  the  global  increase 
reported  by  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC),  and  for  winter 
temperatures have increased 1.3°C. 
The numbers of cooler days have also declined, and warm nights have increased. Rainfall 
has decreased in southeast Mexico in the last 50 years. Temperatures have risen by region, 
with the northern areas showing the highest increase, 0.25°C to 0.50°C per decade (MET 
Office Hadley Centre, 2012), between 1960 and 2010 (MET Office Hadley Centre, 2012, p. 
14). 
Several  models  that  project  possible  changes  in  temperature  and  rainfall  have  been 
developed and perfected in the last decade. The most recent for Mexico were developed 
Mexico’s   39 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
based on the best available information using the results of 15 climate models (Cavazos et 
al., 2013), and those regional scenarios where updated recently.9 
Considering precipitation, different models show different projections, although in average 
for Mexico, it is estimated that precipitations will decline to -10% in most areas of Mexico, 
but there will be regions where such decline could be higher (e.g. Northwestern area in 
Figure 9). Worth noting is that the State of Baja California would show the highest decline 
in annual precipitation (- 40%). 
As  it  may  be  seen  in  Figure  10,  Northern  Mexico  could  show  a  3-4°C  increase  in 
temperature, while in most areas of the country changes are projected within a range of 
1.5°C–2.5°C, except for some areas in the peninsular zones where changes could be lower to 
a maximum increase of 1-2°C. 
A  number  of  vulnerability  assessments  for  several  climate  change  scenarios  have  been 
developed in Mexico during the last two decades. There is evidence showing that the effects 
of climate change together with other pressure factors will have very negative ecological, 
economic, and social consequences.

Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
 
Vulnerability depends not only on adverse climate conditions, but also on the capabilities of 
society to anticipate, face, resist, and recover from an impact. Thus, the vulnerability of a 
society  is  determined  by  its  exposure  to  climate  events, its  sensitivity  and  its  adaptive 
capacity (institutional and social capacities).

Given the vulnerability described above it is imperative to strengthen risk management in 
Mexico. The country has been characterized until now for having a reactive responses, more 
than a preventive ones to disasters. An example of this is the federal budget allocated to the 
National  Natural  Disaster  Fund  (FONDEN)  and  the  Natural  Disasters  Prevention  Fund 
(FOPREDEN) shown in the Figure 11. 
Given the greater recurrence of extreme weather phenomena and their impact on the social 
sector, as well as the scarce budget dedicated to disaster prevention, we must reinforce our 
expertise on hazards and threats to which we are exposed and give priority to prevention to 
address  those  disasters.  Likewise,  it  is  crucial  to  continue  promoting  research  on  the 
vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in Mexico, as it is an instrumental tool to a 
well-informed decision-making.

Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy

An example of this is the research conducted by the National Institute of Ecology and 
Climate Change (INECC in Spanish), which defined the municipalities most vulnerable to 
climate change. This research considered in a first stage three studies (Monterroso, Conde, 
Gay, Gómez, & López, 2014; Monterroso R. . and A. Fernández and R. Trejo and C. 
Conde and J. Escandon and L. Villers and C. Gay, 2014) and took as reference another two 
(Arreguín Cortés, 2015; Borja-Vega & de la Fuente, 2013; CENAPRED, 2016).  
As a result of this analysis 480 municipalities of Mexico were identified with "very high" or 
"high" vulnerability. In a second stage, and taking those 480 selected municipalities as a 
baseline,  the  most  vulnerable  to  climate  change  municipalities  (state  by  state)  were 
identified.  This  analysis  resulted  in  a  list  of  319  municipalities  (a  13%  of  the  total 
municipalities of Mexico; shown in Figure 12).

The climate change adaptation process in Mexico 
 
The climate change adaptation process (CCAP) followed in Mexico is a methodological 
framework embedded in a system holistic approach (SEMARNAT-INECC, 2015). This 
process is constructed by means of the sum of actions aimed to reduce the vulnerability of 
communities, ecosystems and other priorities systems, such as infrastructure. The first phase 
of CCAP considers: 
I.1. Geographical characterization of the natural, social and economic environment in terms 
of priority issues linked to climate change. 
I.2. Establishment of the spatial units of reference through the study area, which defines a 
regionalization  from  an  integrated  territorial  approach  considering:  the  political-
administrative units (municipalities), biophysical landscapes, watersheds, urban-peri-urban 
systems, socio-ecosystems, coastal zones, natural protected areas, etc. 
Mexico’s   43 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
I.3. Identification of the possible climate change impacts in priority sectors, based on experts 
and stakeholders involvement (i.e. climate agenda), and the spatial localization of the causes 
and its impacts (from climatic and non-climatic sources). 
The second phase of the process considers: 
II.1.  Current  vulnerability  assessment,  taking  into  account  the  climate  drivers  and  its 
dominant impacts in the sectors identified in the climate agenda, as well as the conditions of 
future  vulnerability  that  result  from  climate  change  scenarios  analysis.  The  conceptual 
framework applied follows the one suggested by the IPCC (IPCC, 2007), which integrates 
the indices of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. 
II.2. Analysis of the possible adaptation actions to climate change, designed to respond to 
the results of the climate agenda and the dimensions obtained from current and future 
vulnerability.  These  actions  should  be  linked  to  strategies,  objectives  and  adaptation 
approaches of public policy instruments. The main adaptation approaches considered in the 
described  processes  could  be:  ecosystem  based  adaptation  (EbA)(Lhumeau  &  Cordero, 
2012), human communities based adaptation (HCbA) (International, 2010) and disaster risk 
reduction  based  adaptation  (DRRbA)  (UNEP,  2015).  These  are  non-exclusive  and 
complementary to each other. 
The third phase of the process considers: 
III.1. Proposals of climate change adaptation measures (CCAM). A set of possible measures 
for climate change adaptation should be stated, based on participatory workshops with 
different local stakeholders and experts in different, focal (Social, economic, biophysical) 
and sub focal topics (Health, education, agriculture, energy, infrastructure, biodiversity, 
water, etc.). Their viability and relevance must be considered. 
III.2. Prioritization of CCAM. Different methodologies, i.e., cost-benefit analyzes; cost-
effective,  multi-criteria  analysis,  participatory  approach,  engineering  of  optimization 
decision-making, etc., must be applied. In the case of Mexico the criteria published in the 
National Strategy of Climate Change Vision 10-20-40 (INECC, 2013), must be taken into 
account. 
III.3. Design and implementation of priority CCAM. Adaptation actions must respond to 
the  problems  identified  in  the  corresponding  diagnoses;  therefore,  they  must  meet  the 
following characteristics: Feasible, budgeted, synergistic, co-benefits, alignment, evaluable, 
equity, credibility, no regret, reversibility (non-hard measures) and barriers. 
Mexico’s   44 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
 
III.4. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of CCAM is essential in the design of a climate 
change  program  at  subnational  level.  This  process  helps  to  know  the  impact  and 
effectiveness  of  the  implementation  of  actions  and  if  necessary  consider  adjustments, 
rethinking the design or if the CCAM have the expected results in the first stage of process. 
In addition, the M&E will promote better data for decision making also allow to have 
adaptation indicators. 
Characteristics of climate change adaptation measures (CCAM) 
 
Some characteristics of the adaptation measures that could be considered are as follows: 
Feasible.  A  feasibility  analysis  should  be  developed,  that  takes  into  account  different 
variables: political, financial, legal, technical or technological, social, institutional, among 
others. This will ensure a more effective implementation. 
Budget. Actions should identify and include in their description the source of funding with 
which  the  action  will  be  implemented.  This  will  ensure,  as  far  as  possible,  their 
implementation and monitoring. It should include a cost-benefit analysis. 
Synergy.  Providing  benefits  or  impacts  for  both,  adaptation  to  climate  change  and 
mitigation of GHG. 
Co-benefits.  Actions  should  consider  or  include  additional  co-benefits  such  as 
environmental, social, or economic (e.g., employment generation, positive health impacts), 
among others. 
Alignment.  Actions  should  take  into  account  the  national  climate  change  policies  and 
instruments (e.g., General Law on Climate Change, National Strategy on Climate Change 
10-20-40 Vision, Special Program on Climate Change 2014-2018 and Mexico’s INDC) as 
well as in legislation and programs at local level (State Programs on Climate Change). 
Evaluable. They should consider a baseline and a unit of measurement in order to develop 
monitoring and evaluation of adaptation measures (M&E). 
 
Objectives and strategies of climate change adaptation (PECC 2014-2018) 
 
Mexico’s   45 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
The PECC 2014-2018 (SEMARNAT, 2013b) program propose two objectives that promote 
the strengthening of institutional and population capacities, and the design, prioritization 
and  implementation  of  actions  to  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  different  systems  (i.e. 
environmental, social and economic). 
Moreover, these objectives seek to give a priority to prevention acknowledging that it has a 
lower cost in comparison to disaster attention. The PECC 2014-2018 seeks the cross-cutting 
character and the integration of actions to consolidate climate change adaptation in Mexico. 
Objective 1 
Reduce vulnerability of population and productive sectors and increase its resilience and the 
resistance  of  strategic  infrastructure.  The  objective  seeks  to  consolidate  actions  and 
instruments that reduce social vulnerability, favoring prevention and risk management over 
disaster reconstruction. 
Strategies 
1.1  Develop, strengthen and modernize necessary tools to reduce vulnerability to climate change. 
 
The aim of this strategy is designing and implementing territorial planning instruments, 
early risk detection and management which incorporate climate change criteria to reinforce 
decision-making and reduce the vulnerability of the population, the productive sector and 
the infrastructure of Mexico. 
 
1.2  Implement actions to reduce climate change risks in rural and urban populations 
 
Giving priority to disaster prevention is crucial to strengthen the climate change adaptation 
process.  Undertaking  specific  actions  in  the  territory,  such  as  those  contained  in  this 
strategy, as well as incorporating a climate change approach to programs and regulations, 
with the participation of society, could contribute to the reduction of the risks to which the 
population is exposed in a climate change context. 
1.3  Strengthen strategic infrastructure adding climate change criteria in its planning and building 
stages 
 
Mexico’s strategic infrastructure, including the communications, transportation, tourism 
and energy infrastructure, is vulnerable to climate change effects. Therefore, it is essential to 
incorporate climate change criteria into its design, construction, and maintenance, to reduce 
its vulnerability and increase its resistance. 
Mexico’s   46 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
 
1.4  Promote adaptation actions in productive sectors 
 
Mexico's productive sector is key to the economy and social welfare. Given the effects of 
climate change, this strategy intends to implement actions to reduce its vulnerability and 
ensure productivity and competitiveness. 
Objective 2 
 
Conserve, restore and sustainably manage ecosystems to guarantee their environmental 
services  to  promote  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation.  This  objective  seeks  to 
implement and modernize actions and instruments that simultaneously reduce emissions 
and the vulnerability of ecosystems. 
Mexico has a great diversity of ecosystems which provide significant environmental services 
currently under threat. This objective sets 6 strategies and 45 lines of action aimed to 
strengthening  the  sustainable  preservation,  use,  management  and  development  of 
ecosystems  to  guarantee  the  environmental  services  which  they  provide  and  face  the 
negative impacts of climate change. 
Moreover, this objective intends to reinforce the community management of ecosystems, 
reduce environmental threats aggravated by climate change and develop instruments that 
enhance ecosystemic connectivity. 
 
Strategies 
 
2.1 Promote protection, conservation and restoration actions and schemes of terrestrial, marine and 
coastal ecosystems and their biodiversity 
 
This strategy aims at implementing climate change adaptation actions in Mexico which lead 
to reduce the vulnerability of ecosystems by means of their restoration, protection, and 
preservation. 
2.2 Increment and strengthen ecosystem connectivity 
 
The ecosystem connectivity is essential to protect wildlife against the changes projected 
under climate change scenarios. This strategy contains actions oriented to promote this 
connectivity. 
2.3 Implement sustainable agriculture 
Mexico’s   47 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
 
The strategy includes actions aimed at sustainable practices in the agricultural sector. 
 
 
2.4 Develop tools to promote sustainability and emission reductions in agriculture 
 
This  strategy  considers  the  development  of  economic,  legal,  and  technical  instruments 
which incorporate climate change criteria to foster better practices in the agricultural sector 
and that promote side benefits during the development of the production chain. 
2.5 Reduce environmental threats aggravated by climate change 
Climate change induces the recurrence of phenomena such as wildfires and the presence 
and settlement of invasive species in native habitats. This strategy aims at preventing these 
threats and ensuring the conservation of the ecosystems. 
2.6 Integrated restoration and management of hydrological basins 
This strategy includes actions related to land and soils. Specifically, a hydrological basin 
approach allows the development of an integrated management of the territory and its 
resources. This approach should involve the population and all parties involved in the 
management of hydrological basins. 
Equity. Adaptation measures must consider the gender equity approach. 
Credibility. Adaptation measures must include scientific support and cultural and social 
acceptance. 
No Regret. Verify that the implementation of an action does not have a negative impacts on 
sites or sectors 
Reversibility. This issue considers the approach of those measures or actions that could 
irreversibly  affect  ecosystems  (EbA),  highlighting  the  recovery  of  goods,  services  and 
ecosystem functionality. 
Barriers.  The  design  of  adaptation  measures  should  consider  possible  barriers  in  the 
implementation  phase  (e.g.,  legal,  cultural,  technological,  economic,  social  and 
institutional). 
Mexico’s   48 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
Adaptation action areas 
Reducing vulnerability and building a resilient society (A1) 
 
Mexico is especially vulnerable to climate change effects. In recent decades, some of these 
effects have occurred, such as: a decrease in water availability and the presence of floods, 
droughts, and diseases such as dengue or acute diarrheic infections.  The intensity of the 
problem may grow due to geographical characteristics and socio-environmental, economic, 
and  public  health  conditions.  The  vulnerability  assessment  and  the  implementation  of 
adaptation measures must be carried out locally, in response to specific conditions. This 
section establishes lines of action that create the conditions for vulnerability reduction and 
the increase of systems and population resiliency, contributing to a better quality of life.

Lines of action: 
   A1.1 To better identify and attend to zones, settlements, and social groups which are 
priorities for reducing vulnerability and increasing resilience. 
Mexico’s   49 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
   A1.2 To strengthen Integral Risk Management for climate vulnerability. This will 
include communication systems, early warning systems, local evacuation plans, and the 
reduction and management of risk caused by extreme hydrometeorological events. 
   A1.3 To increase resources for disaster management, with a focus on prevention. 
   A1.4 To strengthen, as part of civil protection plans and actions, mechanisms for 
immediate and effective responses in zones impacted by the effects of climate change. 
   A1.5 To strengthen enforcement of land-use regulations to reduce the number of 
illegal settlements in endangered zones. 
   A1.6 To implement and strengthen public policies which guarantee water quality 
and quantity availability in priority zones. These zones are identified as priorities due to the 
probability of climate change related water scarcity. The public policies will emphasize the 
strengthening of eco-hydrological services provided by ecosystems. 
   A1.7  To  ensure  food  security  against  climate  threats  by  giving  preference  to 
integrated watershed management measures, biodiversity conservation, and soil restoration, 
among other ecological support systems. 
   A1.8 To implement and strengthen public policies focused on reducing health risks 
associated with climate change effects. These policies will focus on the most susceptible and 
sensitive groups. 
   A1.9  To  design  and  strengthen  public  policies  which  protect  assets  (housing, 
infrastructure, etc.) from climate change impacts. 
   A1.10 To increase and strengthen public policies focused on reducing risk to public 
health infrastructure. 
   A1.11 To design social vulnerability reduction strategies which include a gender 
approach. 
   A1.12 To implement and strengthen public policies for raising awareness of disaster 
risk management. 
   A1.13 To implement transparent and inclusive public participation mechanisms in 
the design and implementation of climate change adaptation strategies. This may include 
communal, district, municipal, and state councils focused on reducing social vulnerability.

Infrastructure and productive systems 
Climate  change  poses  huge  challenges  to  the  adaptation  of  economic  sectors.  The 
characteristics and respective responses to its impacts will depend on the type of system: 
agriculture,  forestry,  exploitation  of  wildlife,  aquaculture,  fishing,  industrial,  extraction, 
tourism and strategic infrastructure. Likewise, the sectoral response will depend on the risk 
exposure of the system. Each economic sector needs to take into account different aspects of 
climate  change  in  order  to  increase  its  productivity  and  competitiveness.  This  section 
presents  lines  of  action  that  aim  to  strengthen  resilience  and  reducing  climate  change 
vulnerability in economic sectors and strategic infrastructure. 
Lines of action: 
   A2.1 To publish periodic vulnerability assessments for each economic sector, and to 
disseminate them to the private sector and policymakers. 
   A2.2  To  integrate  climate  change  adaptation  criteria  in  existing  economic 
development programs. 
Mexico’s   51 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
   A2.3 To ensure public participation through the creation of inter-municipal boards 
for defining and applying adaptation criteria in local production projects. These projects 
require collaboration between municipal governments and local residents. 
   A2.4 To design and strengthen tools for local risk monitoring, vulnerability analysis, 
and adaptation options for economic sectors. 
   A2.5 To consider climate change scenarios in job development and adaptation of 
land-use for economic development activities. 
   A2.6  To  encourage  efficient  and  sustainable  use  of  water  resources  in  every 
economic activity by periodically updating total water availability. 
   A2.7  To  build  quality  infrastructure,  employ  state-of-the-art  techniques,  and 
strengthen operations for guaranteeing water availability for agriculture. 
   A2.8 To identify economic opportunities presented by climate change through the 
elaboration of local and regional adaptation strategies. 
   A2.9  To  implement  techniques  and  technologies    which  foster  efficient  use  of 
resources and manage climate change associated risks in various economic sectors. 
   A2.10 
   A2.11  To  strengthen  existing  strategic  infrastructure  (communications, 
transportation, energy, among others) in light of climate change scenarios. 
   A2.12 To incorporate climate change criteria into the planning and building of new 
infrastructure. 
 
Ecosystems based adaptation (A3) 
Mexico has great ecological diversity that provides a vast quantity of environmental services 
to  society  (such  as  oxygen,  water,  fuels,  and  food).  These  ecosystems  are  seriously 
threatened by human activities, including by the effects of climate change. The following 
lines  of  action  aim  to  guide  policies  and  instruments  in  order  to  sustainably  exploit 
ecosystems and restore their eco-hydrological functionality and the services provided to 
society, thereby increasing their resilience. 
Mexico’s   52 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
Lines of action: 
   A3.1 To encourage integrated land-use planning for reducing ecosystem vulnerability 
to climate change. With emphasis on priority regions and watersheds this land-use planning 
includes: sustainable use and management, protection, conservation and restoration. 
 
Illustration 6 Coral reef restoration project (high temperature resilient corals), Punta Allen, Quintana Roo, Mexico

   A3.2 To guarantee restoration, connectivity, sustainable use, and conservation of 
ecosystems such as forests, jungles, coastal systems, oceans, riparian ecosystems, wetlands, 
and the biotic communities contained within, as well as associated environmental services. 
   A3.3 To define, by territory, existing programs which foster activities that stabilize 
agricultural-urban boundaries. This is a way to reduce pressure on ecosystems and ensure 
their ecological functionality. 
   A3.4 To ensure that ecosystem vulnerability, biological communities, and priority 
species are included in climate change vulnerability atlases. 
   A3.5 To guarantee eco-hydrological connectivity for the preservation of biodiversity 
and environmental services, the integrity of ecosystems, the conservation of species, and the 
increase of their resilience in the face of climate change. 
Mexico’s   53 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
   A3.6  To  generate  or  modify  legal  and  land-use  planning  instruments  for  the 
reduction of climate change vulnerability of ecosystems and biological communities. This 
will start with the implementation of adaptation measures. 
   A3.7 To develop adaptation programs to maintain and increase surface and ground 
water availability, with a focus on integrated watershed management. 
   A3.8 To establish and strengthen sustainable community management schemes for 
forest ecosystems. 
   A3.9 To increase the amount of reforestation and ecosystem restoration with native 
species suitable for regional climate conditions. 
   A3.10 To increase awareness of problems exacerbated by climate change. These 
problems include forest fire management, and an increase in disease. 
   A3.11  To  guarantee  environmental  protection  of  ecosystems  from  public  works, 
industrial services and economic development projects (mining, textiles, cement, energy, 
agriculture,  tourism,  etc.).  This  will  be  accomplished  by  incorporating  climate  change 
criteria in planning instruments, such as environmental impact assessments and ecological 
land-use planning. 
   A3.12 To develop tools and create valuation schemes for ecosystem services in order 
to contribute to conservation and sustainable development. 
   A3.13 To allocate state funds for the restoration of the most degraded and vulnerable 
ecosystems, as well as for the prevention and recovery of ecosystems that have been affected 
by extreme climate events. 
   A3.14 To establish and implement mechanisms for assessing the impact of locally 
implemented adaptation measures as a means to ensure their effectiveness in the face of 
climate change. 
   A3.15 To strengthen environmental surveillance and protection institutions; to foster 
their cooperation and coordination, as well as to reinforce their inspection, monitoring, and 
enforcement capacities. 
   A3.16 To encourage public participation and training in processes that incentivize 
ecosystem adaptation to climate change. This can include the establishment of bodies such 
Mexico’s   54 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
as  citizen  watchdogs  groups  for  forest  fires,  disease  outbreaks,  and  plant  and  animal 
lifecycle changes, among others. 
 
Prioritization criteria for adaptation measures 
Within  the  scope  of  this  Strategy,  a  guide  is  provided  for  the  selection,  design  and 
implementation processes of specific adaptation measures. Adaptation to climate change 
must be achieved through local processes; the design of measures to be developed will 
depend on the region and context of implementation. Assuming that resources will always 
be limited to face the magnitude of this challenge, it is necessary to strategically choose the 
measures to carry out. 
This section provides criteria for guiding the prioritization of measures at the local level, in 
order to serve as a tool for decision- makers. The main criteria to be considered for the 
selection  of  adaptation  measures  are  described  on  the  following  page.  The  review  of 
prospecive  measures  must  be  based  on  a  multi-criteria  analysis  that  considers 
environmental, social, and economical perspectives. Each criterion could be assigned a 
different weight, according to its importance within a specific context, or new criteria might 
be added as needed. Table 2 describes the criteria to prioritize adaptation actions.

Climate change mitigation 
 
Low-carbon emissions development should start with cost-effective mitigation action that, 
while addressing climate change, have important social and environmental benefits. Energy 
efficiency  and  strategies  to  reduce  short-lived  climate  pollutant  (SLCP)  emissions  are 
example of measures that Mexico’s strategy has prioritized. In order to design mitigation 
policy and prioritize actions, the General Law on Climate Change provided specific criteria 
and directed policymakers to consider short-term, lower-cost alternatives first while develop 
alternatives to reduce future technology costs. Table 3and Figure 5 summarize this decision-
making guidance. 
CRITERIA    DESCRIPTION 
  The quantity of emissions that can be reduced or avoided 
Mitigation potential  by implementing mitigation actions, compared to current 
trends and technologies. 
  Cost of an additional unit of carbon reduced.   It is an 
Marginal abatement cost  economic  concept  that  allows  a  comparison  of  the 
  marginal cost and benefits in order to assess “optimal” 
reduction goals in terms of economic efficiency.  
  Mitigation action can derive important benefits in terms 
of  improving  life  quality  and  development  of 
marginalized  population.  For  example,  access  to 
renewable energy infrastructure in marginal communities 
can  trigger  important  benefits  for  the  population 
promoting  low-carbon  development  and  access  to 
Environmental and social   services  from  education  to  better  equipped  hospitals; 
co-benefits  reforestation  programs  and  good  practices  for  soil 
  management increase environmental services and thus 
benefits for the population; better municipal solid waste 
management reduces diseases, odors, and improve the 
environment of population close to landfills and other 
waste  disposal  sites  .  While  difficult  to  quantify  and 
value, these benefits must be incorporated into selection 
of mitigation measures. 
  Some mitigation actions, generally associated to fossil 
fuels reduction, generate economic savings because of 
their  positive  health  impacts.  The  actions  focused  on 
Health co-benefits 
SLCPs reduction are a clear example of measures that 
contribute to improving air quality, and thus improve 
health. 
Mexico’s   57 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
  Other  benefits  that  should  be  considered  include 
increases  in  productivity  associated  with  mitigation 
measures.  For  example,  the  optimization  of  urban 
transportation  routes,  urban  planning,  and  large-scale 
Increased productivity 
transportation projects reduce traffic congestion whilst 
diminishing  travel-times,  vehicle  operation  costs,  and 
increasing mobility.  Energy efficiency measures come 
often with productivity increases in the industrial sector. 
  Financial,  technology,  regulatory,  and  social  barriers 
might prevent the implementation of mitigation actions. 
Enabling environments  Barriers  must  be  analyzed  during  the  planning  and 
  measures  selection  process,  considering  ways  to 
overcome  them  and  policies  to  promote  adequate 
enabling environments.

GHG emissions 
 
In  2013,  Mexico’s  GHG  emissions  from  all  economic  activities  in  the  country  totaled 
665,304.92 Gg of CO . These emissions include energy, industrial processes, agriculture, 
2e
land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF), and waste sectors, without including 
carbon  removals.      Accounting  for  removals  is  important  to  estimate  Mexico’s  net 
emissions, since the LULUCF sector acts as a net sink, offsetting approximately 26 percent 
of greenhouse gas emissions.  Thus, net emissions, including removals, were 492,307.31 Gg 
of CO  equivalent (see Figure 14 and Table 4).  A full description of methodologies and 
2
developments to improve the reporting of national emissions can be found in Mexico’s First 
Biennial Report to the UNFCCC (INECC and SEMARNAT, 2015). 
 
Figure 14 Mexico’s GHGs emissions by economic sector and gas 
Source: (INECC and SEMARNAT, 2015) 
 
Emissions in 2013 increased 40%, compared to the level in 1990. Figure 15 shows historical 
emissions, without considering LULUCF sector removals. Energy related GHG emissions 
have experienced the largest growth, with an annual growth rate of 2.3% between 1990 and 
2010,  growing  in  absolute  terms  63%  in  that  period.  In  the  period  2002-2012,  GHG 
emissions’ average annual growth rate was 2.5%, whilst GDP average annual growth for the 
Mexico’s   59 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
same period was 2.4%; showing that emissions in Mexico and GDP have not yet been 
decoupled.

Mobile sources 
In 2013, emissions from on-road and non-road mobile sources reached 174,156.53 Gg of 
CO ,  contributing  26%  of  the  total  national  emissions.    Important  methodological 
2e
improvements  were  used  in  our  latest  inventory  for  this  sector,  including  the  use  of 
modeling tools that include in-detail vehicle fleet characteristics to obtain emission factors 
(i.e.  technology  characteristics,  maintenance  parameters,  and  travel-speed  estimations, 
among others.)  
Electricity 
Emissions  from  electricity  generation  sector  contributed  126,607.66  Gg  of  CO , 
2e
corresponding to 19% of total GHG emissions nationally.  This sector has experienced 
important technological changes in past years. Between 2010-2013, an important retirement 
of conventional thermal power plants and gas turbines occurred, with new combined cycle 
and wind plants coming online. Compared to 2010, changes in fossil use are as follows: 
Coal: -1.7% (from 344.2 to 338.4 PJ); fuel oil: 12.8% (from 362.1 to 408.6 PJ); diesel: 97.2% 
(from 12.8 to 25.3 PJ); and natural gas: 20.3% (from 988.3 to 1,189.3 PJ) (SENER, 2014). 
Industry 
Emissions of CO , CH , and N O from the burning of fuels in the industrial sector and CO , 
2 4 2 2
CH , and N O, HFCs, and SF  coming from industrial processes totaled 114,949.19 Gg of 
4 2 6
CO , contributing to 17% of national emissions.  Subsectors that contribute the most to this 
2e
category include cement, steel, chemical, mining and metallurgy. 
Oil and gas 
Oil  and  gas  sector  plays  an  important  role  in  Mexico.  Emissions  from  production, 
transportation,  distribution,  processing,  and  use  of  hydrocarbons  in  the  country  were 
estimated,  considering  fuel  used  in  different  combustion  processes  as  well  as  fugitive 
emissions from processes of production, burning, venting, and distribution of hydrocarbons. 
In 2013, the oil and gas sector emitted 80,455.26 Gg of CO , which accounted for 12% of 
2e
total GHG total emissions.  
Agriculture 
In the agriculture and livestock sector, CH , N O, occur from livestock activities (livestock 
4 2
enteric  fermentation  and  manure  management),  as  well  as  agricultural  activities  (soil 
management, rice cultivation, and field burning for crop residues). Also, CO , CH , and 
2 4
N O emissions from the use of fuels for energy purposes - mainly used in irrigation systems - 
2
contribute to the sector’s emissions. Emissions from the sector were 80,169.09 Gg of CO , 
2e
which represents 12.0% of total GHG total emissions.  
Mexico’s   61 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry  
In 2013, emissions from the LULUCF sector were 32,424.86 Gg of CO , representing 4.9% 
2e
of total emissions. Thus, emissions from land converted to grassland, settlements, and other 
land, as well as fires, contributed 45,007.61 Gg of CO  in total. Meanwhile, reforestation 
2e
and afforestation sequestered a total of 12,582.75 Gg of CO . Carbon sequestration from 
2
permanence of forest land, grassland, and agricultural land totaled -172,997.61 Gg of CO . 
2
Therefore, net LULUCF emissions totaled 141,536.00 Gg of CO , which makes this sector 
2e
an important carbon reservoir.   Important improvements in the methodology used to 
estimate LULUCF emissions include: the use of data on carbon content of different types of 
vegetation from the updated National Forest and Soil Inventory (CONAFOR, 2013) in two 
sampling periods (2004-2007 and 2009-2013); updated information on vegetation and land 
use cover from the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics (INEGI, 
2013); derivation of allometric equations suitable for Mexico; and estimation of national 
emission and removal factors. 
Waste 
This sector includes emissions of municipal solid waste (MSW) and hazardous waste as well 
as the treatment and disposal of municipal and industrial wastewater. In 2013, emissions 
from this sector totaled 30,903.02 Gg CO , of which 21,462.65 Gg CO  correspond to 
2e 2e
MSW  and  9,440.37  Gg  CO   to  wastewater.    A  full  bottom-up  approach  was  used, 
2e
accounting for emissions at a very disaggregate level, particularly for MSW and wastewater 
treatment. 
Short Lived Climate Pollutant emissions 
 
Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), also known as short-lived climate forcers, include: 
methane,  black  carbon,  tropospheric  ozone,  and  some  hydro  fluorocarbons.  These 
pollutants shorter lifespan in the atmosphere compared to CO , but therefore have a relevant 
2
short-term impact on climate.  In general, the impact of different gas species on climate 
change is determined by its radiative forcing (W/m2). Along with global efforts to reduce 
CO and the other long-lived climate pollutants (LLCP), action on SLCPs offers significant 
2 
opportunities to tackle climate change in the coming decades with significant co-benefits for 
public health. 
Due to the role that these emissions could play on climate change mitigation, and its 
important co-benefits in human health, Mexico has already included in its inventory and in 
its NDC the quantification and mitigation action for black carbon.10

In 2013, total BC emissions were estimated in 125.1 Gg (see Table 5).  Again, transportation 
was the main source of emissions, with 37.8%, followed by the industrial sector and the 
residential sector with 28.3%, the latter mainly due to household’s wood use.  Electricity 
generation and agriculture contributed 6.8% and 7.1%, respectively. The remaining sectors, 
oil and gas, LULUCF, and waste sum up the remaining 4.8%.

Emissions projections  
 
Designing  a  long-term  GHG  development  strategy  requires  an  exercise  of  emissions 
projection often expanding many decades into the future. Economic modeling normally 
assists this type of analysis in order to integrate social, economic and technology variables 
that influence future emissions development. Given the complexity of estimating future 
emissions, economic models are often supported by sector-specific models such as energy, 
land, agriculture and water models, as well as by climate models which provide some 
feedback effects with the earth system.  Modeling frameworks that integrate different types 
of models to understand policy issues are often refer to as “integrated assessment models”. 
They have been widely used in the climate change research community.  
 
The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report on mitigation issues recognizes that there are multiple 
pathways towards a world that limits temperature change to 2ºC. Our current state of 
knowledge indicates that significant emissions reductions over the next few decades must be 
realized in all of the 2ºC scenarios, and the global economy must reach near zero emissions 
of CO  and other GHGs by the end of the century. Scenario analysis shows that stabilizing 
2
GHG concentrations at 450 ppm by 2100 would require a reduction of 40 to 70% of global 
anthropogenic GHG emissions reductions by 2050 compared to 2010 (IPCC, 2014).     
 
Mexico’s   63 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
Of course, an important ethical question arises regarding the fair burden sharing of the 
global mitigation effort.  The Paris Agreement helped us break the impasse in the climate 
negotiations by providing a framework through the NDCs submissions where all countries 
act considering a fairness principle and their national circumstances. Also, a number of 
studies have provided some basis of analysis to assist countries crafting climate policy, 
particularly considering cost-effective mitigation. For instance, Figure 16 shows abatement 
potential in 2030 for different stabilization scenarios for selected Latin American countries, 
including Mexico. These scenarios were run under the auspices of the CLIMACAP and 
LAMP project.11

11 An important research effort to study climate policy in Latin America was funded by the 
European Union in the context of the CLIMACAP project (EuropeAid/131944/C/SER/Multi) and 
of the U.S. Agency for International Development and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 
the context of the LAMP Project. This section draws from results of this international collaboration 
project for the literature review, given the wide arrange of modeling tools that were used in that 
assessment and the participation of modeling groups from Latin America and international experts. 
Mexico’s   64 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
 
 
As shown in the figure, for a 450 ppm world, important reductions worldwide must be 
accomplished by 2030. This goal is consistent with previous literature that looked at the 
global effort.  Latin American countries show different feasible reductions depending on 
their  demographics  and  abatement  cost,  which  varies  regarding  country  resource 
endowments and current technology mix (Octaviano, Paltsev, & Gurgel, 2016).   
 
In principle, the results of the abovementioned multi-model analysis suggest that Mexico 
should, based on cost-effectiveness mitigation criteria to reach global temperature goals by 
2030, keep emissions within a range close to its emissions in 2010.12  Mexico’s NDC falls 
within this range, since economy-wide emissions in our NDC compared to 2010 would only 
increase 10% by 2030 (Gobierno de la República de México, 2015).   
 
Quantification of the mitigation effort and cost provides an important set of information for 
the Paris global stocktake.  Therefore, we aim in this section of our strategy to run specific 
modeling scenarios that can help us assess our mitigation to 2050.  While Mexico is a 
developing country, we acknowledge the need to take action that can trigger the level of 
ambition needed to reach the 40 to 70% global reduction by 2050.  We believe these metrics 
could be useful as we discuss both the 2050 targets, and the means required to implement 
them. 
 
Literature review 
 
In this section, we briefly discuss some results from the literature looking at mitigation 
pathways for Mexico, in order to provide a brief overview and identify key studies that can 
support the long-term mitigation goal of Mexico.  In the following section, we develop 
original modeling analysis to assess the NDC goal of Mexico and the 2050 trajectory.   
A first quantification of the mitigation potential often starts with a bottom-up analysis of 
abatement opportunities and costs.  Mexico has conducted a number of these type of studies 
over the last years, which have been important to help us design our National Climate 
Change  Strategy  (SEMARNAT,  2013a)  and  the  Special  Program  on  Climate  Change 
(SEMARNAT, 2014). Figure 17 shows an estimation of the marginal abatement cost curve 
                                                
12 For a 450 ppm the Figure shows that Mexico could hold emissions approximately between 90-
140% of 2010 levels.

Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
in  the  country  (INECC  and  SEMARNAT,  2012).    As  shown,  several  negative  cost 
measures were identified, mainly regarding energy efficiency potential.13As aforementioned, 
Mexico’s GLCC and NSCC mandate the evaluation of marginal costs of mitigation actions, 
and thus marginal abatement curves (MAC) are useful to help us comply with the legal 
criteria for assessing measures. 
 
Figure 17 Marginal abatement cost in Mexico estimated for 2030 (using 2010 data) 
Source: (INECC and SEMARNAT, 2012) 
 
While this type of bottom-up analysis is useful as a first approximation, economy-wide 
mitigation policy can have price effects and interactions between different systems in the 
economy (i.e. the energy system with the transportation system, and others) that make an 
isolated bottom-up analysis limited.  For this, economy-wide and energy systems models 
have been used to look at the interaction of different technologies and potential mitigation 
costs  in  Mexico.  Figure  18  and  Figure  19  present  marginal  abatement  cost  curves  for 
Mexico in 2030 and 2050, respectively, resulting from CLIMACAP/LAMP cross-modeling 
exercise which included a wide-range of modeling techniques such as general equilibrium 
models, energy systems models and market equilibrium models. 
 
                                                
13 Some of these measures, while cost-effective, often require policy actions and incentives to change 
current behavior.  In strict terms of course, they are no zero cost, but their implementation could 
report more economic benefits than costs.

As  shown  in  the  figures,  marginal  abatement  costs  differ  among  countries  and  across 
models.  Also, the curves are different if we compare 2030 to 2050. For the same 50% 
reduction from baseline in 2050, more abatement is needed than in 2030, and thus more 
expensive mitigation measures are required.  By comparing different abatement costs of the 
models presented, we can infer that marginal mitigation costs could range from less than 50 
to around 200 dollars per ton considering fossil and industrial emissions. This range is for 
CO2 per ton from a scenario similar to Mexico’s NDC of 22% reduction by 2030. A 
mitigation of 50% reduction of emissions from fossil energy by 2050, could imply costs from 
100-450 dollars per ton looking only at results from fossil fuel and industrial CO  (Clarke et 
2
al., 2016).14

Many variables influence differences across models, such as: baseline assumptions (van 
Ruijven  et  al.,  2016),  assumptions  regarding  the  potential  deployment  of  low-carbon 
technologies (van der Zwaan et al., 2016) and structural differences among models (i.e. 
whether models include all sectors of the economy, different gases, land-use or focus mainly 
in the energy sector). While models differ in their specific answer to technology options and 
overall cost, there is a clear agreement of the need of low-carbon technologies rollout.  As an 
example, Figure 20 shows modeling results for the penetration of low-carbon technologies 
in Mexico’s electricity sector.  For an scenario of 50% reduction of emissions by 2050, all 
models rely on energy efficiency measures and the deployment of renewable energy. This 
includes important shares of bioelectricity in some cases, or gas or coal with carbon capture 
and storage, in other cases.

Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
 
Figure 20 Electricity generation in 2050 by technology and scenario 
(Veysey et al., 2016) 
 
Recent studies in Mexico, funded by the Ministry of Energy, have also found a large 
potential for energy efficiency measures in combination with renewable energy for low-
carbon energy supply by 2030 (Jorge Islas Samperio and Fabio Manzini and Paloma Macías 
and Genice Grande, 2016). This study assessed 84 mitigation actions in the residential, 
commercial, public, industrial, hydrocarbon and transportation sectors.  Such actions were 
estimated to cost 98.3 billion US dollars .15 These researchers’ findings point out that the 
transportation sector has the highest abatement potential at 49%, followed by electricity at 
27% and industry at 15%. 
Also,  Mexico  participated  in  the  Deep decarbonization project  under  the  UN  Sustainable 
Development  Solutions  Network  with  a  modeling  exercise  funded  by  INECC  in  2015 
(Tovilla,  2015).    The  deep  decarbonization  modeling  exercise  in  Mexico  showed  an 
important  role  for  natural  gas  CCS  technology  for  2050,  along  with  energy  efficiency 
improvements in the industry and a fast penetration of electric vehicles.  In particular, this 
study estimates that full electric light duty vehicles are expected to represent a 45% of the 
fleet while the rest uses flexi fuel systems. It also projects a full decarbonization of the power 
sector.

In  sum,  there  is  already  a  nascent  body  of  literature  focusing  on  understanding  and 
quantifying climate change mitigation policy in Mexico. Studies point to an important 
mitigation  potential  in  the  country,  with  different  pathways  available  for  Mexico  to 
transition to low-carbon development (Veysey et al., 2016).  
Mid-century mitigation scenarios 
 
For the economic analysis and emissions projection of the Mid-century Strategy (MCS), we 
selected one model that has the capability of simulating the global mitigation efforts. This 
model considers Mexico in detail, and captures all of GHGs and economic sectors.  The 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) Model is a 
multi-sector,  multi-region  computable  general  equilibrium  (CGE)  model  of  the  world 
economy, with Mexico disaggregated as a region.  It has updated information for Mexico 
regarding economic structure and the energy sector, resulting from a scientific research 
collaboration  project  between  Mexico  and  the  MIT.16 It  utilizes  the  GTAP  dataset17, 
augmented by data on the emissions of greenhouse gases, aerosols and other relevant gases, 
taxes,  and  details  of  selected  economic  sectors.  For  this  exercise,  we  also  updated 
information regarding current cost of renewable energy technologies in Mexico.18 
The model projects economic variables (GDP, energy use, sectoral output, consumption, 
etc.) and emissions of greenhouse gases (CO , CH , N O, HFCs, PFCs and SF ) and other 
2 4 2 6
air pollutants (CO, VOC, NO , SO , NH , black carbon, and organic carbon) from the 
x 2 3
combustion of carbon-based fuels, industrial processes, waste handling, and agricultural 
activities.    EPPA  can  simulate  emissions  limits,  carbon  markets  with  domestic  and 
international trading, and technology regulations, such as energy efficiency standards for 
vehicles, among others (Y.H. Chen and S. Paltsev and J. Reilly and J. Morris, 2015).  This 
model has been widely used for the analysis of climate and energy policy, including a 
number of studies in the US, EU, Mexico, Brazil, China and other developing countries (H. 
                                                
16 The model version used is EPPA 6 and has been updated with Mexico’s information as part of the 
research collaboration between Centro Mario Molina and the MIT Joint Program for the Science 
and Policy of Global Change, with funding from the Molina fellowship and Mexico’s Council for 
Science and Technology (CONACYT). 
17 Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP), hosted by Purdue University, is a global network of 
researchers and policy makers conducting quantitative analysis of international policy issues. The 
dataset compiles and systematizes input-output tables to be used for economic analysis. 
18 The last electricity bidding processes in Mexico showed record low prices for solar energy, and 
also lower costs than previous projects for wind energy.  We reduced the “mark-up” parameters of 
renewable energy technology in the EPPA model to make them similar to efficient combined cycle 
technologies; although they are not perfect substitutes due to intermittency of solar and wind.

Jacoby and H. Chen & 2014., 2014; Jacoby., 2012; Octaviano et al., 2016; Sergey Paltsev, 
2009).  
From the outset, we must acknowledge that all modeling exercises have limitations and that 
there  are  intrinsic  uncertainties  in  predicting  such  long-term  horizons.  Our  purpose  in 
presenting  the  quantitative  analysis  of  Mexico’s  mitigation  goal  is  to  advance  the 
understanding of our mitigation options. It should not, at any moment, be understood that 
Mexico has fixed mitigation policies for the decades to come, nor that all of the reductions 
resulting from the model will be required for sectors strictly based on economic efficiency.  
On the contrary, we will remain flexible in the face of a quickly changing technology and 
climate policy innovation environment. What are fixed are our commitments, long-term 
goals, and policy principles as mandated by our laws. We present the modeling analysis for 
the insights it provides to guide long-term action, as it helps in identifying critical actions to 
scale-up mitigation. 
We believe that there is high value in systematizing the information of Mexico and other 
countries’ emissions and emissions drivers. This systematization can be done with our best 
available modeling tools, without being dogmatic about their use. The quantification of our 
strategy can provide a basis to better address potential implications. It can also inform a 
discussion about the importance of international collaboration for the fast mobilization of 
means of implementation, including technology, finance and capacity building needs. 
Baseline emissions projection to 2050 
 
Mexico’s population of 121 million people in 2015 is expected to reach 137 million by 2030; 
and by mid-century Mexico’s total population could reach 150 million (CONAPO, 2010). 
The size of our economy, as measured by GDP, in 2015, was 1.144 trillion dollars, making 
it the second largest economy in Latin America (World Bank, 2016).  The EPPA model 
endogenously estimates GDP growth rate for the policy scenarios; however, the business as 
usual scenario requires data about future growth expectations.  A 3% average annual growth 
was used, which was derived from domestic data and the IMF mid-term projection for 
Mexico (International Monetary Fund, 2016; SENER, 2016).19    
For the baseline projection, we allow the MIT EPPA model to estimate the emissions 
trajectory without imposing climate or energy policy constraints.  The model considers 
                                                
19 SENER uses a 3.3% growth rate for long-term planning; IMF projected worth rate for the medium 
term 2021 is 2.9%.

population growth, GDP growth rate, technology costs and resource endowments in the 
country to assess the business as usual scenario. 
Mitigation scenarios 
 
We defined two mitigation scenarios:   
a)  NDC  policy.    This  mitigation  scenario  simulates  a  reduction  target  of  22%  of 
economy-wide GHGs by 2030, and 51% of black carbon.  For 2050, the MCS goal 
simulated a trajectory after 2030 that reaches a 50% reduction of GHGs, compared 
to  Mexico’s  2000  emissions.  For  assumptions  regarding  the  rest  of  the  world’s 
mitigation, we consider that all countries deliver on their INDC mitigation pledges 
by 2030, and that by 2050, global mitigation reaches 50% below 2010 level. We 
consider this could be in line with a 2ºC stabilization scenario of 450 ppm, drawing 
from previous IPCC reviewed research.  We also allowed for domestic trading of 
GHGs  using  IPCC  AR5  global  warming  potentials  for  trading  tons  of  CO  
2
equivalent across gases.  We did not simulate international emissions trading.20 
 
b)  NDC more ambition.  This mitigation scenario simulates a more ambitious policy of 
reducing 36% of economy-wide GHGs in the economy by 2030, and 70% of black 
carbon.  For 2050, the MCS goal simulated a trajectory after 2030 that reaches a 50% 
reduction  of  GHGs,  compared  to  Mexico’s  2000  emissions.  It  has  additional 
constraints to simulate a minimum of 50% of clean electricity production by 2025, in 
line with Mexico’s energy transition law, and a 40% methane reduction considering 
coordinated action in North America.  For assumptions regarding the rest of the 
world’s mitigation, we consider that all countries deliver on their INDC mitigation 
pledges by 2030, and that by 2050, global mitigation reaches 50% below 2010 level. 
We consider this could be in line with a 2ºC stabilization scenario of 450 ppm, 
drawing  from  previous  IPCC  reviewed  research.  We  also  allowed  for  domestic 
trading of GHGs using IPCC AR5 global warming potentials.  We did not simulate 
international emissions trading. 
 
Modeling results 
 
GHGs emissions pathways resulting from our modeling exercise are shown in Figure 21.  
Our baseline projection (in blue) shows that economy-wide emissions could reach 973 
                                                
20 This can of course be added to the analysis since the EPPA model allows for international 
exchange of emissions permits; however, we considered premature to simulate a global emissions 
trading system at the moment.

emissions trajectory (orange) shows that emissions would be reduced to 762 million tons by 
2030, a 22% reduction compared to the baseline projection, and reach 311 million tons by 
2050.  The NDC more ambition trajectory (green) estimates a reduction of 36% GHG 
emissions reductions from the baseline and reaches the 311 million tons of CO  by 2050.

The gray area represents the total cumulative emissions reduction that our economy could 
deliver in the NDC policy scenario. Total emissions reduction potential, with additional 
efforts to accelerate mitigation actions, is represented by the gray area plus the orange area. 
As shown in Figure 21, the NDC more ambition trajectory implies a peaking of national 
GHG emissions by or before 2026, as stated in Mexico’s NDC. 
 
Figure 21 Mexico’s GHG mitigation scenarios 
 
Figure  22  shows  emissions  reductions  for  CO   (the  size  of  the  bubble  represents  total

emissions by source; and on the vertical axes the CO  baseline allows comparison with the

reduced costs of renewable energy that allow for some penetration of it in the baseline trajectory.

(SF ).  An important flexibility mechanism in our simulation is emissions permits trading 
6
including  different  gases.  Understanding  the  critical  role  of  emissions  trading  for  cost-
effective mitigation, Mexico has started the policy design of this instrument and plans to 
launch a pilot trading exercise this year.22

22 Due  to  the  importance  of  this  instrument,  accelerated  policy  design  and  implementation  is 
required. More collaboration and capacity building in this area could help speed the process.

Figure 23 Other GHG emissions by scenario 
An essential component of Mexico’s climate policy is the reduction of short-lived climate 
pollutants.  We also modeled explicitly the goals for black carbon (see Figure 24). 23  We 
underscore that these are additional policies that can help raise global ambition, and thus 
Mexico has started unilateral action in this regard and committed to this as part of our 
NDC.  As  explained  in  previous  chapters,  Mexico  prioritized  these  measures  for  their 
important benefits in health and ecosystems. Figure 25 shows the reductions of other air 
pollutants  that  could  be  associated  with  both  the  GHGs  and  BC  policy  goals.24   The 
pollutants in Figure 25 (SO , NO  and VOC) are well known ozone precursors which is a 
2 x
secondary pollutant that is of major concern in many cities in Mexico, as shown by our 
National System for Air Quality monitoring (SINAICA).25 
 
 
                                                
23 An additional constraint was needed to reach the 51% reduction goal on BC, meaning that the 
level of reduction of this pollutant will not be achieved only with GHG policy measures and thus 
requires additional policies. 
24 We did not model other policies targeting particularly SO , NO  or VOC. Of course some policies 
2 x
targeting specifically this pollution could be analyzed as a follow-up study to better understand the 
interaction with climate policies (i.e. measures to introduce emissions control equipment for these 
pollutants such as current standards for fuel charging stations, power plants, etc.)

Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
Regarding  technological  trends,  the 
model allows evaluation of the potential 
role  of  new  technology  adoption  in 
different  sectors.    For  example,  in  the 
energy  sector,  the  model  allows 
forecasting  required  changes  in  energy 
use. Figure 26 shows primary energy use 
in the different scenarios. As shown in 
the figures, in a baseline scenario oil and 
natural gas dominate the energy mix.  It 
 
is interesting to point out that renewable 
energy does gradually enters the mix in a 
business as usual scenario, though only 
slowly  without  specific  policies 
supporting  adoption.  In  both  policy 
scenarios  renewable  energy  penetrates 
rapidly replacing oil and coal use.26 The 
relevance of renewables as a mitigation 
option was explored by the IPCC work 
on  renewable  energy  mitigation 
 
potential,  as  well  as  other  reference 
studies  for  the  future  of  renewable 
energy  (Maureen  Hand  and  Sam 
Baldwin and Ed DeMeo and John Reilly 
and Trieu Mai and Douglas Arent and 
G. Porro and M. Meshek and D Sandor, 
2012; Ottmar Edenhofer and R. Pichs-
Madruga and Y.Sokona and K. Seyboth, 
Gerrit, & Stechow, 2011). 
 
Energy  efficiency  is  also  a  critical  Figure 26 Primary Energy Use by Scenario 
mitigation  option,  as  shown  by  the 
decrease in total energy demand in both scenarios.  The replacement of oil though more 
energy  efficiency  is  a  critical  component  of  the  policy  scenarios.  Particularly,  the 
transportation sector requires fast new efficient technologies in a short timeframe, as shown 
                                                
26 Renewable energy reported is a sum of solar, wind and biomass (both biofuels and bioelectricity).  
In Mexico, an important resource could also be geothermal energy, which is not explicitly modeled 
here. 
Mexico’s   77 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
by the miles per gallon indicator resulting from the policy simulation exercise (see Figure 
27.)  In addition to energy efficiency, an important share of reductions comes from the 
introduction  of  electric  vehicles.      Modeling  results  suggest  that  incentives  for  a  rapid 
increase of fleet efficiency and hybrid and electric vehicle adoptions will be important to 
achieve the 2050 goal.  
Clean electricity is particularly important in both policy scenarios for all sectors in the 
economy. As shown in the policy scenarios for a 50% economy-wide emissions reduction, 
the power sector must be almost fully decarbonized by 2050.27 This is particularly relevant 
in the context of the transformation of the electricity market where solar and wind power 
are increasing their share in the electricity matrix, driven in part by changes in the legal 
framework for the sector, and by important reductions in the cost per MWh for those 
technologies.  
It  should  also  be  noted  that  Mexico  has  already  established  in  its  long-term  Energy 
Transition Strategy a goal of 50% clean electricity by 2050. Compliance with that goal relies 
on the design and operation of the recently created Clean Energy Certificates market, and 
on  compliance  with  annual  targets  on  clean  energy  for  qualified  electricity  suppliers. 
Whether a full decarbonization of the electricity sector can be achieved is still an open 
discussion in Mexico. For that reasons, other mitigation options could complement the 
clean electricity goal if more time is required, such as more or enhanced action on reducing 
emissions of SLCP.   
Of  course,  the  complete  transformation  of  electricity  supply  comes  with  a  myriad  of 
challenges ahead; particularly as the sector has long-lived infrastructure and the lock-in 
problem of fossil-fuel based generation. In addition to the economic questions, deploying 
large shares of renewable energy could be technically challenging given the intermittent 
nature  of  solar  and  wind  resources  (IEA,  2011;  NERC,  2009;  Pérez-Arriaga,  2011), 
although the recently created CENACE, as independent electricity dispatcher, estimates 
that the integration of up to 30% intermittent renewable energy in the system is manageable. 
Mexico  is  collaborating  with  the  USA,  Canada,  Denmark  and  other  countries  in  the 
assessment  and  resolution  of  integration  challenges  and  the  identification  of  needed 
infrastructure.  Collaboration  in  planning  for  new  technology  adoption  will  surely  be 
important as our countries advance in climate policy goals. 
                                                
27 This finding is supported by the deep decarbonization modeling exercise for Mexico, and has been 
also found in other countries’ analysis of 50% and more mitigation strategies.

Figure 27 Transportation Energy Efficiency Improvement  
Finally,  in  addition  to  emissions  and  technology  trends,  the  economic  model  provides 
socioeconomic  indicators  to  assess  potential  climate  policy  costs.  Figure  28  shows 
populations trends (input data), GDP per capita and consumption component of GDP.28 As 
shown in the figure, it is particularly in the last decade of the policy evaluated, where 
emissions reduction becomes more burdensome for the economy.  The results underscore 
the value of investing today in innovation and research development in order to reduce low-
carbon technologies cost and prepare for the high ambition mitigation scenarios needed. It is 
important to highlight that this model estimates only mitigation costs, and does not include 
the benefits of reducing climate change impacts in the economy or the value of reducing the 
climate risk more generally.  The benefits of action, while difficult to quantify in economic 
terms, are much higher.

A closer look at the electric power sector 
 
Given the critical role of the electricity sector for reaching climate goals, having a closer 
look  at  technology  deployment  in  the  sector  is  important.  The  power  sector  is  a  very 
complex one, since many variables are required for the proper analysis of power demand 
and supply at many different time scales.29  Sector specific models can support the analysis 
of  top-down  models  in  this  sector  to  better  understand  the  technology  implications  of 
climate policy. 
Denmark  and  Mexico  have  initiated  The  Climate  Change  Mitigation  and  Energy 
Programme, with a specific component on developing more tools to support planning in the 
electric power sector.  Therefore, the Ministry of Energy provided some modeling results 
from the Balmorel model that explore the technology implications of reaching the current 
clean electricity medium and long-term goals.   
The Danish-Mexico project used the Balmorel model.30 This tool is useful for analyzing the 
electricity and combined heat and power sectors. It may be applied for long range planning 
as well as shorter-term operational analysis. This cost-optimizing model can compute both 
the capacity needed to meet demand and the energy dispatch for short-term time horizons. 
It has been calibrated to represent Mexico’s electricity system and is used along with the 
SIMICE model platform, a modeling tool by SENER.31 Figure 29 shows the expansion of 
the system estimated by the Balmorel model, and total electricity generation for the MCS 
period.  
This modeling was done with the goal of assessing electricity system needs to meet a 50% 
clean energy goal.  As shown in the detailed electricity sector model, a wide range of 
technologies could be expected to play a role.  Consistent with the EPPA model results, 
renewable energy plays an important role (wind, solar, bioenergy, geothermal and hydro).  
Cogeneration also plays an important role, along with natural gas technologies.   
                                                
29 Electricity supply and demand must be balanced at all time, thus timescales span from seconds to 
minutes and hours.  Also, medium and long term planning requires careful consideration of fixed 
and operational variables costs, demand projections and other uncertainties both in short term and 
long term variables.

Design and assessment of forest carbon mitigation actions32 
Mexico’s Land Use, Land Use Change, and 
Forestry (LULUCF) sector is considered a net 
greenhouse gas (GHG) sink and thus has an 
important  role  in  balancing  GHG  emissions 
and removals at the national level (INECC and 
SEMARNAT, 2015). However, key challenges 
remain  to  identify  and  understand  the  main 
drivers of this sink, and consequently, to design 
and  prioritize  mitigation  action  that  reduce 
future GHG emissions and increase sinks in a 
cost-effective manner. Since 2012, the National 
Forestry  Commission  (CONAFOR),  with 
international cooperation of the Government 
of  Norway,  the  Canadian  Forest  Service 
(CFS), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), and the 
Commission  for  Environmental  Cooperation 
(CEC), has been developing methods and tools 
to  advance  the  understanding  of  the  role  of 
natural  carbon  sinks  in  climate  change 
mitigation for Mexico (Olguín M. and Kurz 
 
W.A.  and  Wayson  C.  and  Fellows  M.  and 
Illustration 7 Panthera onca, Mexico

CONABIO 
Olguín M. and Wayson C. and Kurz W. and 
Birdsey R. and Fellows M. and  Maldonado V., 2015). This collaboration recognizes the 
importance of policy priorities for the Mid-Century Strategy, and thus identifies short-term 
(avoided deforestation), medium-term (degradation and forest restoration) and long-term 
(sustainable forest management, ecosystem-based adaptation) mitigation strategies. Both the 
role of ecosystems in vulnerability reduction and future potential impacts of climate change 
on forests and climate sensitive ecosystems are considered in this collaboration. 
Methods 
                                                
32 This section was elaborated by Mexican forestry researcher, M.Sc. Marcela Olguín, with funding 
from the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC), a trinational organization through 
which the governments of Canada, Mexico and the United States collaborate on environmental 
issues. The National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR), and experts from the Canada and the US 
provided useful comments. 
Mexico’s   82 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
The analytical framework used was the Carbon Budget Model CBM-CFS3 (Kurz et al., 
2009). This model follows the Gain-Loss method of the IPCC to estimate annual GHG 
emissions and removals from all five IPCC carbon pools and has been used in many other 
countries (e.g. Canada, 26 EU countries, Korea, Russia, and China). During the initial 
phase of the model adaptation, Mexico was stratified based on the intersection of the 32 
federal states and 7 ecoregions of the North America Level 1 classification creating 94 
spatial units nation-wide (Olguín M. and Wayson C. and Kurz W. and Birdsey R. and 
Fellows M. and  Maldonado V., 2015). The model was then run for CONAFOR’s early 
actions on REDD+ (Figure 1).  Using the CBM-CFS3 in a  spatially-referenced approach 
(IPCC, 2003), forest GHG emissions and removals were estimated by combining: a) forest 
distribution  and  forest  growth  data  (derived  from  Mexico’s  National  Forest  and  Soil 
Inventory),  rates  on  fires  and  land-use  changes  (i.e.,  deforestation  and  forest 
recovery/afforestation), ecological parameters (e.g., litter fall and decomposition of dead 
organic matter) and climate data. 
Results 
Figure 31a shows an example of 
the  business-as-usual  scenario 
generated  for  the  Yucatan 
peninsula  (3  states,  6  spatial 
units)  by  extending  the  historic 
time  series  of  activity  data  into 
the  future  and  calculating  the 
resulting  GHG  fluxes.  Overall, 
forests  represent  a  net  sink  of 
CO e  due  to  removals  from

established forests. However, the

time  (even  when  a  constant 
disturbance rate is assumed) due to the cumulative effect of the aging of the forest (lower 
average growth rate and higher biomass), plus the reduction of forest area by deforestation. 
Figure  31  shows  the  effect  of  a  mitigation  scenario  that  gradually  reduces  the  rate  of 
deforestation by 2.5% per year for the period 2011 to 2030. The estimated trends show that 
halving the deforestation rate over 20 years would yield a cumulative 40% reduction in net 
GHG  emissions  (Olguín  et  al.  2016).  Relative  to  other  activities,  such  as  increasing

reforestation (results not shown in the figure), reducing deforestation generates immediate 
and significant avoided GHG emissions.  This type of analysis can be extended to the 
remaining forested states in Mexico.

Progress and next steps 
Several  activities  are  being  conducted  to  refine  the  simulation  of  carbon  dynamics  in 
Mexico and to increase the level of complexity of the scenarios (e.g. by including forest 
degradation and sustainable forest management). However, even at this preliminary stage, 
this study showed the potential use of an analytical framework that integrates data from 
multiple  Mexican  sources  and  resolutions  into  an  internally-consistent  reporting  and 
accounting system of past and future GHG emissions in Mexico. This approach can also 
assess the effect of different human activities on future GHG fluxes and enhances the 
collaboration between policy-makers and the scientific community in Mexico to analyze 
and rank alternative policy scenarios. 
Finally,  improving  information  exchange  and  capacity  building  on  the  design  and 
assessments of mitigation activities in the forest sector contributes to harmonizing GHG 
emissions reductions strategies at a regional level in North America, where forests cover 
about 720 million hectares (FAO-FRA 2015) and all three countries are among the top 12 
highest  GHG  emitters  globally  (IEA  2013).    Thus,  collaborative  work  continues  with 
support from the CEC to assess carbon in forests ecosystems and the use of harvested wood 
products  (including  trade  among  the  three  countries)  to  assess  portfolios  of  mitigation 
options (e.g. NDCs and Mid-Century emission reductions assessments).

Mitigation action areas 
 
Clean energy transition (M1) 
 
Mexico’s energy reform has set in motion a complete transformation of the energy sector in 
the country.  New legal arrangements provide incentives for the participation of the private 
sector in many areas previously reserved for the State. While maintaining some activities to 
independent  regulatory  bodies  and  the  Ministry  of  Energy,  the  new  environment  uses 
market forces to attract investment and new technologies to the energy sector.  
 
An important instrument of the energy reform is the mandate to craft an Energy Transition 
Strategy.33  This strategy has the goal to promote clean electricity generation to reach the 
General Law on Climate Change and promote the use of clean fuels.  During 2016, Mexico 
ran  an  extensive  consultation  process  for  the  development  of  the  Energy  Transition 
Strategy.  A Council for Consultation of the Energy Transition Strategy was on April 7, 
2016, pursuant to the Energy Transition Law, with four working groups: 1) production, 2) 
consumption, 3) energy efficiency and 4) energy storage. 
 
A vision for 2050 for the sector has two components: 
 
•  An  energy  sector  operating  with  clean  technologies  that  is  energy  efficient  and 
promotes productivity, sustainable development and social equity in the country. 
•  An energy supply that allows for universal access and that is diversified, sufficient, of 
high quality and competitive prices. 
 
In terms of clean energy, the reform: 
•  Eliminates entry barriers and simplifies interconnections, to promote investments 
•  Sets clean energy goals 
•  Establishes the evaluation of social impacts of projects 
•  Promotes  energy  trading  through  a  competitive  approach,  by  using  the  new 
electricity market 
•  Creates the Clean Energy Certificates program, and specific fiscal incentives. 
•  Creates regulation to allow the participation of clean distributed energy resources 
•  Promotes more transmission infrastructure  
For each energy technology, the Energy Strategy states measures in four areas: regulation 
and policies, capacities and human resources, institutions, markets and financing.   
                                                
33 The Energy Transition Strategy will be launched by the end of 2016.

GHG emissions. This dual role supports 
the goals of growth and competitiveness 
in  the  country.  This  effort  aims  to 
promote  measures  that  accompany

  M2.13  To  adapt  and,  if  necessary,  design  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework 
applicable to fuels in order to reduce GHG emissions. This would particularly focus 
on fuels which are not currently regulated, such as fuel oil and marine diesel. 
  M2.14  To  create  a  national  system  of  mandatory  vehicle  inspection,  including 
control mechanisms. Additionally, to review and adjust emission standards of the 
vehicle fleet with the participation of the three levels of government to ensure high 
levels of efficiency in all additions to the national vehicle fleet, including imported 
used vehicles. 
 
Sustainable cities 
 
This line of action is based upon an urban development model that is capable of regulating 
land-use, considering efficient transportation systems, low-carbon buildings, and integrated 
water and waste management. The policy is implemented fundamentally on a local scope. 
 
Lines of action: 
 
Sustainable urban development 
  M3.1 To increase planned and efficient land-use by diminishing urban sprawl and 
guaranteeing access to intra-urban land; to promote mixed-use development and 
vertical buildings; to incentivize densification instead of greenfield development; to 
connect urban forests; and to define urban growth limits. 
 
Buildings 
  M3.2 To promote strengthening, adoption, and application of regulations, standards, 
and legislations which boost efficient technologies for new and existing buildings in 
the following áreas: water, energy, gas, thermal isolation, renewable energy, and 
carbon  capture  practices  (for  example:  green  roofs,  vertical  gardens,  and  urban 
orchards). 
 
Mexico’s   89 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
Mobility 
  M3.3 To encourage the evolution towards safe, clean, low-emission, accessible, and 
comfortable  public  transportation  systems.  This  is  to  be  accomplished  by 
strengthening  regional  and  national  interconnectivity  through  the  generation  of 
multimodal  efficient  networks  supported  by    the  Federal  Government.Greater 
interconnectivity  will  take  place  in  a  context  of  urban  development  and 
transportation policy that reduces travel times and distances. 
  M3.4 To develop transport regulatory entities with understanding of national and 
regional  demand.  The  regulatory  entity  will  optimize  transportation  systems  to 
reduce travel times and distances. 
  M3.5 To encourage programs which reduce the need for transportation, such as: 
telework, housing exchange or leasing to bring people closer to their academic or 
work placess, collective transportation services for companies, and flexible work 
schedules. To accomplish this, Mexico will diversify and prioritize urban services 
and equipment in areas with mixed—use development. 
  M3.6 To promote efficient and low-emission transportation systems, and to modify 
the regulatory and pricing framework in order to foster reinvestment and continuous 
improvement. 
  M3.7  To  generate  incentives,  infrastructure,  and  programs  for  non-motorized 
transportation as part of integrated transportation systems in which the pedestrian 
and the cyclist are given priority. This will create immediate environmental and 
health benefits. 
 
Integrated waste management 
  M3.8 To incentivize private sector participation in projects for waste sorting, reuse 
and recycling, the development of biogas plants, water treatment plants, and the 
establishment of recycling centers. These type of projects will be incentivized by 
developing an adequate enabling environment with new mechanisms, regulations, 
and markets.  
  M3.9 To encourage  new  technologies  and infrastructure for wastewater treatment, 
integrated  solid  waste  management,  and  biogas  energy  exploitation.  These 
developments  will  be  financed  through  co-investment  schemes  and  economic 
instruments which cover the operating costs and maintenance of new and existing 
infrastructure. 
  M3.10 To create regional bodies with a long-term national and regional vision for the 
development of landfills and wastewater treatment plants. These regional bodies will 
give certainty to projects with long development periods and benefit from economies 
of  scale.  To  encourage  reinvestment  and  continuous  improvement,  Mexico  will 
adjust the regulatory and pricing framework. 
  M3.11 To promote and develop state and municipal integrated waste management 
plans which foster social participation in waste sorting and recovery in accordance 
with the National Integrated Waste Management Program.. 
Mexico’s   90 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
  M3.12 To revise and promote pricing systems for collection and disposal services in 
order to incentivize reinvestment in technological and logistic improvements. 
  M3.13 To improve monitoring, inspection, and enforcement actions for compliance 
with integrated waste management regulation. 
 
Agriculture and Forestry 
 
Forests are important carbon 
reservoirs;  their  destruction 
and  degradation  constitutes 
one  of  the  most  important 
emission  sources  globally. 
Simultaneously,  conservation 
and  sustainable  management 
can  contribute  to  increasing 
the quantity of carbon stored 
in forests. On the other hand 
agriculture  and  livestock   
Illustration 10 Maíz Zea. 
activities  are  key  for  food  Source: National Commission for Biodiversity, CONABIO 
security,  but  significantly 
contribute to GHG.  
 
In this strategic effort, key lines of action are proposed within the agriculture and forestry 
sectors in order to encourage practices that reduce emissions and avoid policies that may 
diminish their mitigation scope. Applying a landscape-level approach on policies of large 
compacted areas such as biological corridors or watersheds, is key for deeply considering 
the conditions of: natural resources, trends, human influence, conservation, restoration and 
development opportunities. 
 
Lines of action: 
 
  M4.1 To encourage local communities to plan the sustainable use of forest resources 
to incentivize preservation and conservation of forests. This will reduce deforestation 
and avoid land-use changes whilst protecting natural assets. 
  M4.2  To  strengthen  sustainable  forest  management  and  restoration  of  degraded 
forest ecosystems in order to increase carbon capture and storage. 
  M4.3 To promote the incorporation of forests into sustainable management and 
certification schemes in order to stop degradation and maximize the carbon capture 
and storage. 
Mexico’s   91 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
  M4.4 To encourage programs for the preservation of forest ecosystems in priority 
regions in order to maintain carbon sinks and guarantee federal, state, and municipal 
intervention. 
  M4.5  To  formulate  and  implement  plans,  programs,  and  policies  for  reducing 
deforestation  and  degradation  of  forests  within  a  REDD  Strategy.These  policies 
must include a sustainable rural development and landscaping approach, and they 
must observe social and environmental safeguards. 
  M4.6  To  establish  restoration,  regeneration,  or  reforestation  schemes  for  carbon 
capture and storage in Natural Protected Areas. This may include other instruments 
for land and terrestrial ecosystem conservation. 
  M4.7  To  implement  land  conservation  programs  that  guarantee  integrity  and 
increase carbon capture. 
  M4.8 To increase the establishment of agriculture, livestock and forestry production 
programs  with  greater  mitigation  potential  and  environmental  and  social  co-
benefits.This can include silvopasture agroforestry systems and linking traditional 
knowledge with current agriculture and livestock problems. 
  M4.9 To encourage agriculture practices that preserve and increase carbon capture in 
soil  and  biomass,  such  as  conservation  cultivation  and  productive  reconversión. 
These practices replace monoculture with polyculture or perennial crops. 
  M4.10 To generate programes which result in reducing emissions from the inefficient 
use of fire in forests and agriculture and livestock lands. 
  M4.11  To  implement  agricultural  policies  oriented  towards  the  better  use  of 
fertilizers,  a  more  calculated  application  of  fertilizers,  producing  and  applying 
biofertilizers, as well as efficiently using nitrogenates. 
  M4.12  To  implement  efficient  resource  recovery  programs  for  livestock  waste 
management. 
  M4.13 To implement actions for energy efficiency and use of renewable energy in 
agriculture, livestock, and fishing projects. This may includ the encouragment of 
biodigesters. 
  M4.14 To establish livestock production programs that reduce emissions and capture 
carbon in grazing lands through appropriate livestock management, stocking rate, 
and planned grazing. 
  M4.15 To strengthen forest monitoring in order to avoid illegal logging and forest 
fires. This may be accopmlished through the establishment of community monitoring 
groups. 
 
Short-Lived Climate Pollutants and health co-benefits of climate action 
 
These actions focus on reducing SLCP emissions, targeting cost-effective mitigation actions 
that have multiple benefits including air quality improvement, reduced water pollution, 
reduced crop damages and other important co-benefits. 
 
Mexico’s   92 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
Lines of action: 
 
  M5.1 To promote the regulation of SLCP sources and uses. 
  M5.2 To classify SLCP emission sources according to emissions magnitude, global 
warming potential, and mitigation costs. This is to be followed by the development 
of abatement mechanisms. 
  M5.3 To accelerate the penetration of low global warming potential refrigerants in 
different sectors including: air conditioning, refrigeration, and foaming agents. This 
will be accompanied by the reduction of leaks, HFCs management and adequate 
disposal. 
  M5.4  To  strengthen  best  practice  programs  for  refrigeration,  recovery  and  final 
disposal  of  chlorofluorocarbons  (CFCs),  hydrofluorocarbons  (HFCs),  and 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). 
  M5.5 To strengthen regulation and programs for preventing and controlling forest 
fires, prescribed fires, and slash and burn practices. 
  M5.6 To implement sustainable resource recovery programs for forest biomass and 
agriculture waste. 
  M5.7 To implement clean transportation systems in freight corridors. 
  M5.8  To  encourage  the  implementation  of  emission  reduction  and  operational 
efficiency  programs  focused  on  operational,  administrative,  technological,  and 
financial characteristics within the freight sector. This will be balanced by the needs 
of the owner-operator and small truckers. 
  M5.9 To substitute cooking overa n open fire for efficient, low- emission stoves. To 
disincentive the unsustainable use of wood, we will focus on municipalities with high 
and very high level of marginalization. 
  M5.10 To encourage the use of technologies and fuels that reduce BC emission, such 
as particle filters and ultra-low sulfur diesel. 
  M5.11 To encourage BC emissions reduction in medium and large scale industries 
by changing coke fuel, fuel oil, and diesel for low black carbon emission fuels. 
Additionally, emission control systems and energy efficiency will be implemented 
within processes. 
  M5.12 To encourage BC emissions reduction in the micro and small scale industries 
through  productive  reconversion,  technological  change,  and  energy  efficiency  in 
industries such as the brick industry. 
  M5.13 To eliminate open air burning in dumps, landfills, and in backyards. 
  M5.14 To establish MRV mechanisms in operations of methane burning and venting 
during  gas  and  petroleum  production.  This  MRV  will  be  reinforced  through 
monitoring. 
  M5.15  To  implement  actions  which  reduce  fugitive  methane  emissions  coming 
mainly from petroleum, gas, and mining operations. These emissions may also be 
reduced in natural gas piping, processing, and distributing systems. 
Mexico’s   93 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
  M5.16  To  encourage  electricity  generation  from  biogas  projects  in  landfill  and 
wastewater  treatment  plants.  This  will  have  the  additional  benefit  of  avoiding 
methane and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. 
  M5.17  To  incentivize  the  control  of  VOC  emissions  and  tropospheric  ozone 
precursors in organic waste aerobic treatment (composting). 
  M5.18 To control VOC emissions in industrial sources, gasoline service stations, and 
from solvent use. 
  M5.19 To implement a measurement and accounting system for SLCP emissions, for 
tracking emission sources, and for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of 
implemented policies for SLCP emission reduction. 
Mexico’s   94 
Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy 
  
Evaluation and updating of the MCS 
 
The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, with the participation of the Inter-
Ministerial Commission on Climate Change, will review the National Climate Change 
Strategy at least once every  ten years regarding mitigation policy, and every  six years 
regarding adaptation policy. Corresponding scenarios, projections, objectives, and goals 
must then be updated, and deviations from previously stated projections must be explained. 
Based  upon  these  reviews  and  the  evaluations  results  conducted  by  the  INECC’s 
Coordination  for  Evaluation  and  the  Climate  Change  Council,  the  National  Climate 
Change Strategy might be updated. The Special Climate Change Program and the State 
Programs must be adjusted to consider these updates. Under no circumstance will the 
reviews and updates lessen the goals, projections, and objectives previously stated. 
The  IMCC  may  propose  and  approve  adjustments  or  modifications  to  scenarios, 
trajectories, actions, or goals comprised in the National Strategy when: 1) new international 
commitments on the matter have been adopted; 2) new relevant scientific or technological 
knowledge is developed; 3) required by environment, natural resources, economy, energy, 
sustainable transportation, health, and alimentary security policies; and 4) indicated by the 
evaluations results carried by INECC Coordination for Evaluation. 
Mexico will resubmit its MCS to the UNFCCC, if as a result of the evaluation process new 
information becomes available germane to the Convention and the global stocktake referred 
in the Paris Agreement.
