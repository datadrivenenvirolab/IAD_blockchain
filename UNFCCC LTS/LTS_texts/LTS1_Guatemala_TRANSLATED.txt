The use of fuels is also essential to project the behavior of GHG emissions. In Guatemala there is a high dependency on imported liquid fuels From cession of firewood as fuel used for cooking and rural heating. GHG emissions from the use of fuels are reflected in the energy supply residential demand and in transportation. The baseline provides information on the main emission sources and identifies in which sectors there are increased opportunities for mitigation. In the summaries sectoral numbers below greater detail of economic activities and emissions tions associated in each sector. This information is also Available in greater detail in the technical document of the Strategy. This process was designed to promote changes bios in activities that generate higher emissions through options that reduce GHG emissions and that contribute significantly to improving the socio-economic conditions economic and environmental aspects of the country.

Strategy Impacts The implementation of the mitigation options of the strategy of development with low emissions will allow the country to continue in its development path while reducing the intensity of its emissions. greenhouse gas emissions.

Implementation of the strategy will require coordination multisectoral collaboration within the work tables. Although the 43 options of mitigation vary greatly between and within sectors required for its implementation are mostly similar: a facilitating framework mainly by the Government of Guatemala with participation of the corresponding sectors; investment from sources public and practices; participation of civil society to ensure that the benefits and co-benefits of the actions are maximized and dis- equitably distributed; and capacity building research and training through the country's universities. Added to this coordination is the banking financial relations of the country green product financing benefit the implementation of mitigation practices and technologies prioritized in the strategy.
