Adaptation to climate change indicates the adjustment of natural or human systems in response to present or future climatic stimuli or their effects exploit beneficial opportunities. There are different types of adaptation anticipatory and reactive adaptation planned. Afforestation: Afforestation or afforestation is the planting of trees with the aim of establishing a wooded state on an area that has remained treeless for a long time human time scales) belonged to the forest area. It differs from reforestation in that that this one is done on a wooded area shortly before. Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA): This is the definition given by the FAO which is retained in this strategy document aims to strengthen the capacity of agricultural systems to contribute to food security integrating the need for adaptation and the potential for mitigation in the development strategies of sustainable agriculture. » Approach by additional costs: The approach by additional costs development projects through concessional loans from development banks finance the additional needs dedicated to covering the additional costs of the projects of development brought about by the consideration of the environment and its protection. In the specific case adaptation and mitigation these funds. Mitigation: Anthropogenic intervention to reduce the sources or increase the sinks of Gas to Greenhouse Effect (GHG). Climate change: Climate change refers to a variation that is statistically significance of the mean state of the climate or its variability persisting over long periods of time (generally 7Low carbon development strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 natural internal processes or external forcings atmospheric composition or land use. It should be noted that the Framework Convention United Nations on Climate Change (UNFCCC) climate change” as being “changes in climate that are attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and that are in addition to the natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods. » The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between "climate change" which can be attributed to human activities altering the composition of the atmosphere climate" due to natural causes. See also Climate variability. Energy efficiency: Ratio of the energy efficiency of a transformation process or from a system to its energy input. Anthropogenic emissions: GHG emissions human activities. These activities include the combustion of fossil fuels for the production energy net increases in emissions. Clean energy: Clean energy or green energy is a source of energy whose exploitation produces only negligible amounts of pollutants compared to other more widespread sources and considered more polluting. The concept of clean energy is distinct from that of energy renewable: the fact that an energy is reconstituted does not imply that the operating waste of this energy disappear as clean energy: Geothermal energy hydroelectric; Solar energy ; Biomass; Tidal power tidal turbines Renewable energy: A renewable energy is a source of energy which is constituted or replenishes faster than it is used. Their use does not in any way entail the extinction of the initial resource and it is renewable on a human scale. We can thus retain as renewable energy: wind energy solar for energy due to gravity (tidal energy) or internal geodynamics (energy geothermal). Human settlements: Place or area of settlement. 8Low carbon development strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 Structured finance: Structured finance designates all the activities and products in place to provide funding to economic players the use of complex structures. This includes the subordination of claims to create a debt senior securitization also participates in structured financing liquid into a liquid security Greenhouse gases (GHGs): GHGs are the gaseous components of the atmosphere anthropogenic spectrum of infrared radiation emitted by the surface of the earth property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapor (H2O) nitrogen (N2O) Earth. There are also GHGs resulting solely from human activities halocarbons and other substances containing chlorine and bromide Montreal Protocol. Besides CO2 sulfur (SF6) of the GES. Food insecurity: A situation that exists when people do not have safe access to food food and nutrients in sufficient quantities to ensure growth and normal development and an active and healthy life. It can result from the lack of food insufficient purchasing power at the domestic level. Food insecurity can be chronic Carbon sink: Any process aerosol Resilience: Capacity of social systems event to maintain adaptive capacity Climate scenario: Likely and often simplified representation of the future climate an intrinsically coherent set of climatological relationships possible consequences of anthropogenic climate change impact models. Climate projections are frequently the raw material climate scenarios 9Low carbon development strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 of the real climatic data type. A “climate change scenario” is the difference between a climate scenario and the actual climate. Energy transition: The concept of energy transition refers to the transformation phase which should make it possible to gradually move from an energy system based essentially on fossil fuels (coal less centralized energy sources hydraulic efficiency and energy sobriety (motors and will concern almost all human activities (transport Vulnerability: The degree to which a system is likely to experience or be adversely affected by adverse effects of climate change extremes. Vulnerability depends on character climatic conditions to which a system is exposed adaptation. Vulnerability to climate change: The Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC. Working group II at which a system is likely to experience or be adversely affected by the adverse effects of climatic changes vulnerability depends on character a system is exposed 10 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 RESUME(cid:3)EXECUTIF(cid:3) The Low-Carbon and Climate-Resilient Development Strategy is a medium to short term thematic cross-sector strategy 2025. It responds to Benin's dual need to cope with the adverse effects of changes climatic conditions, in particular by identifying adaptation on the one hand on the other hand. The vision of the strategy is; “Benin is to climate change and low carbon intensity”. This view is based on that of BENIN ALAFIA 2025 and has the overall objective of contributing to the sustainable development of Benign country strategies. More specificly stratégie ALAFIA 2025 Sustainable development” which covers the following three sub-themes: Environmental management and cities (increasing environmental degradation and anarchic urbanization) technology (significant technological lag) prosperity). The development of this strategy is based on the assessment of both vulnerability and the GHG mitigation potential of the six (06) main development sectors1 that underpin tend the sub-themes mentioned above. The overall objective of this strategy is broken down into three specific objectives: (a) strengthen the resilience of local communities and economic production systems (SO-1) anthropogenic GHG emissions (OS-2) especially those most vulnerable to natural disasters (SO-3). This strategy will be implemented through twelve sub-programmes organized around the three pillars next attenuation: 1 These are the sectors of Agriculture Water resources of 27 May 2013. 11 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 - Pillar 1: Strengthening the resilience of local communities and systems of agricultural production productivity and avoiding production losses of the main sub-sectors of agriculture and develop the capacities of local communities in the management of a resilient decentralized development. Under this pillar, five sub-programs (SP) will be implemented. artwork : o SP-1: Sub-program to strengthen the resilience of communities and sectors agricultural; o SP-2: Climate Financial Services Implementation Sub-Program structuring; o SP-8: National sub-program for capacity building of local authorities in support of the emergence of regional hubs of resilient development in the face of climatic changes ; o SP-11: Multi-purpose dam construction sub-program; and o SP-12: Drilling sub-program drinking water and community management of structures. The main impacts expected from the effective implementation of this pillar the level of food security Gross Interior (GDP) of Benin and an increased degree of resilience of local communities to to climate change. - Pillar 2: Reduction of GHG emissions of anthropogenic origin and improvement of carbon sequestration potential as well as for the reinforcement of the carbon sequestration potential of the forest massifs. This pillar is implemented through the following three sub-programmes: o SP-3: Energy transition support sub-program; o SP-4: Sub-program for the development of a mechanism for control/regulation of GHG emissions; and o SP-5: Enhancement of Carbon Sinks and Reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The main effect expected from the implementation of the sub-programmes of this pillar GHG reduction framework of the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (CPND). 12 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 - Pillar 3: Reduction of climate risks communities in the face of natural disasters as well as climate-sensitive diseases. This pillar will be implemented through the following sub-programmes: o SP-6: Flow network establishment and restoration subroutine natural and stormwater drainage; o SP-7: Information Early Warning System Strengthening Sub-Program climate change and natural disaster risk management; o SP-9: Sub-regional sub-programme for the protection of West African coasts; and o SP-10: Climate-sensitive disease vector control sub-program. Under the implementation of this pillar (Material and bodily damage urban and peri-urban areas decrease in the prevalence of climate-sensitive diseases (malaria diarrheal in disadvantaged areas (slums). To these three pillars knowledge management Climate Change (DGCC) of the Ministry of Living Environment and Development Sustainable. The operational plan for the effective implementation of the strategy is based on the success of the implementation of this axis. The sub-programmes of the strategy will be implemented by the sector Ministries under the coordination of the Ministry of Living Environment and Sustainable Development through a steering committee that includes the main actors of implementation. The financial resources necessary for the implementation of this strategy mainly through the three financing mechanisms which are: the investment budget of State Benin's multilateral and bilateral partners. With the implementation of this Strategy inaction and intends to remove the limiting factors caused by climate change ensure that the flowers generated by the implementation of its ALAFIA development program 2025 13 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 PREFACE(cid:3) (By His Excellency Mr. Guillaume Athanase Patrice TALON Climate change is no longer just an environmental concern among others that need to be regulated. It has become concrete with its harmful consequences, especially on the countries the less advanced coming years an increase in temperatures of the order of 0 pessimistic We currently retain that all the key sectors of the socio-economic life of Benin are affected by the issue of vulnerability/adaptation/mitigation to climate change: agriculture including livestock and fishing human health 20 years sea level make the living environment of households vulnerable (the infrastructure human settlements It is to counter these climatic risks that Benin has decided to develop a climate change strategy. low-carbon, climate-resilient development spanning the period 2016-2020 technical support from Expertise France as part of its regional program « AFRICA 4 CLIMATE ». This is a document that presents the state of the climate in Benin and attenuation. It establishes a diagnosis of the vulnerability of the main sectors of economic development of the country institutional implementation and monitoring-evaluation. He will have to accompany Benin to face the adverse effects of climate change, in particular through measures to adapt to climate change. climate change on the one hand part. The implementation of this strategy requires everyone's participation. It will require efforts coordinated multisectoral meetings of all public and private actors at all levels. She will be put in works under the coordination of the General Directorate of Climate Change of the Ministry of Living environment and Sustainable Development around its twelve sub-programs organized around three pillars, namely: adaptation climatic changes. It covers areas vulnerable to climate change: agriculture and rural development infrastructure and human settlements 14 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 (cid:3)INTRODUCTION(cid:3)(cid:483)(cid:3)The(cid:3)Benin durable(cid:3) The Republic of Benin Climate Change (UNFCCC) voted resolution 66/288 of the General Assembly of United Nations Earth Rio+20 sustainable development and the promotion of an economically sustainable future environmental It is in this context that the Republic of Benin sustainable development 2025; Benin ALAFIA 2025. Under this strategy well-governed country of social well-being”. For this purpose adopted a number of regulatory texts aimed at improving the environment for implementing the sustainable development. However, climate change threatens to jeopardize development efforts economy of developing countries Environment (UNEP) in its fifth report on the state of the environment (GEO-5); " The climate change is aggravating the problems put additional pressure on natural resources such as fresh water or land due to extreme weather events. Benin is currently affected by the climate change and will continue to be Benign temperatures with an increase of the order of 0 for the most pessimistic by 2050 or even +6°C by 2100. Faced with these additional constraints induced by climate change Benign collaboration with UNDP resilient to climate change. This strategy, which is a planning instrument short- and medium-term intersectoral theme weaknesses of the various programs and strategies to combat climate change in the 15 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 country. This strategy reinforces the enabling activities recommended to the Parties of the CCNUCC are under development This is how Benin a low-carbon and climate-resilient development strategy climatic. As such, it has benefited from technical assistance and financial support within the framework of of the regional program now called AFRICA 4 CLIMATE under the direction of Expertise France This is how the development of this strategy. These include the following activities in particular: - An identification and planning mission (from 10 to 16 October 2014) which resulted in the development of a detailed roadmap; - The mobilization of a team of consultants (01 national and 01 international) to provide technical assistance to the national counterpart involved in the process. The team of consultants produced a framework note indicating the methodological approach adopted as well as the detailed planning of the process; - The holding of a methodological workshop (Wednesday, April 1, 2015) during which the members sector working groups have been trained in the use of the analysis tools of the vulnerability and mitigation potential; - The establishment of six (06) Sector Working Groups (GTS); 1) Agriculture and rural development land humans. The GTS have met several times with a view to analyzing the vulnerability and mitigation potential of their respective sectors. Each group has produces a sector report - Consultation of decentralized actors (local elected officials) (dismemberment of the state) regional workshops; one held in Parakou on July 21 and another in Bohicon on July 23, 2015; and - The holding of a workshop to validate the strategy document by all stakeholders on February 23 and 24, 2016 at the Hôtel les Oliviers in Porto-Novo.

Nevertheless UNEP State of the Environment (GEO-5) report notes that “Agreed upon targets have only been partially achieved the environment […] and that in places certain critical thresholds have been exceeded”. It is also noted than in Africa complex of problems governments It is in the face of this alarming observation previously climate issues on the agenda of major world events today media Conferences of Parties (CoP) international community is mobilizing to fight against climate change. Benin is not left out (DGCC) within the Ministry of Living Environment and Sustainable Development (Ex Ministry of the Environment Responsible for Climate Change Management and Protection of Natural and Forest Resources) due diligence recommended by the UNFCCC. The governance of Climate Change in Benin is governed by the strong expression of the will of the Government to deal with the adverse effects of climate change and to contribute to the 18 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 international efforts to reduce GHGs. Consideration of climate change in development strategies and policies stems from the international commitments made by the Benign. The following table summarizes the main commitments signed Commitments signed Signature by Benin of the Convention – United Nations Framework on Changes (UNFCCC) Signature by Benin of the Kyoto Protocol to combat climate change Development of the National Strategy for the Implementation (SNMO) of the Framework Convention on United Nations on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Development of the National Action Plan to Combat Desertification (PAN/LCD) Development of the Growth Strategy for Poverty Reduction (SCRP 2011-2015) Development of the National Action Program for the purposes of Adaptation to changes climatic (2008) National Communications of Benin on climate change (Initial and second) National Strategy for Sustainable Development in Benin (2004) Development of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (2015) The country's commitment and will are clearly displayed in the pursuit and strengthening of efforts to take climate change issues into account. This translated to through the development of sectoral projects and programs and the creation Beninoise for the Environment (ABE) (CNCC a Directorate General for Climate Change within the new Ministry of the Framework of Life and Sustainable Development and the implementation by the Government decree n°2014-359 creating of Economic Modeling of Climate Impacts and the Integration of Changes Changes in the General State Budget (CMEICB). 1.2.

This global warming observed since the middle of the century is characterized on the indices of climatic extremes by an increase in the number of nights hot weather and an increase in the occurrence of heat waves throughout the sub-region (Ly et al. 2013). Results on climate change projections based on 29 global climate models the CMIP5 experience for 2041-2069 compared to the most pessimistic scenario or RCP8.5 indicate a significant increase in surface temperatures over the entire sub-region relative to the period 1981 to 2010. The warming at the surface level intensifies towards the north. In the sahelian regions rainfall from June to September in the medium term and weakens towards the coastal regions and on the Atlantic Ocean (Fig 1.a). The precipitation projections (Fig 1.b) result in a rate increase of around 30% in the eastern parts of the Sahelian region Niger and to Chad. While in the western regions around 20% compared to the seasonal climatological average of 1981-2010 Mauritania a)  b) Figure 1: a) Median temperature difference (°C) of the air at the surface of the Earth over the JJAS season between the reference period 1981-2010 and future period 2040-2069 20 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 RCP8.5 extreme scenario for the evolution of radiative forcing over the medium term (2040-2069). b) Median rate of precipitation (%) over the JJAS season between the reference period 1981-2010 and the future period 2040-2069 by 29 global models considering the extreme scenario RCP8.5 for the evolution of the radiative forcing on the medium term (2041-2069) Thus global warming and the spatial variability of precipitation could be associated negative impacts on agriculture especially in some parts of the sub-region where agriculture contributes about 40% to 60% of household income. And agriculture is largely dominated by a number of small producers growing mainly varieties of cereals (ex. one thousand Based on these climate projections, recent studies have shown that the agricultural calendar can result in a reduction in yields that can range from 20 to 50% by 2050 (Sarr 2012). More specifically in Benin (at latitudes below 7 almost constant annual this latitude northwest and northeast respectively.

On a monthly basis of April in the south of the country. As for the North precise trend on a monthly scale. Regarding the air temperature regions of Benin compared to the reference period 1971 – 2000; the lowest value would be 2 South West. Since the increase in temperature generally induces a increase in potential evapotranspiration (ETP) certain conditions a water deficit.

In effect extremes were noted including heavy rains in several places in the country without there being a spatial coherence. The development of the Action Program National for the Adaptation to Climate Change (NAPA) in Benin has in fact made it possible to determine that the nature and the severity of climate risks are not distributed evenly over the eight (8) zones agro-ecological systems of the country. The studies relative have shown that the sectors regions most exposed to droughts, for example, are the agro-ecological zones 01 (extreme north-Benin) Fisheries) impacted differently. Rainy season settings increased interannual variability over the past two decades. Agro-climatic risks re-sowing common to periods of historical drought and of the last two decades. The occurrence of false starts and early ends makes the distribution of rain events of the season unprofitable farmers and is also correlated with rainfall deficits in the region (Alhassane and to the. 2013). 22 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 Thereby adjustment of cropping calendars must take into account this variability in climate change. 1.4.

But taking into account these adverse effects often the structure of sectoral budgets does not allow this to be taken care of. This is how the Government of Benin decided in the Council of Ministers4 to integrate climate issues into the following six operational development sector plans: 1) Agriculture and development rural 5) Health and Sanitation What's more electricity) of Benin makes it possible with this strategy to accelerate the process of transition energy in which the country is committed with in particular the promotion of energy efficiency and the energy mix with a significant share of clean and renewable energies. This option of development in addition to being low in carbon will considerably reduce the energy bill which weighs so heavily on the economy of Benin of electricity. In effect of ivory electric (including 53 electricity. Electricity being the main factor of industrial production competitiveness of companies established in Benin is greatly impacted. It is under this 4 Council of Ministers held on May 27, 2013 24 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 economic perspective that the additional cost approach was adopted for the development of the strategy. It should also be noted that from an economic point of view appropriate” would be more costly for the countries rapport The Economics of Climate Change environmental would be more important than an effort in this area. Conclusion that confirms the OECD6 stating that “the cost of inaction is high ambitious actions to protect the environment without compromising growth economic ". In effect 2050 GHG would only cost 1% of global GDP per year. Benin understood that doing "nothing" against the effects of climate change would lead to enormous productivity and production losses caused by climatic events flooding and “reconstruction” generated by dealing with these extreme events. Inaction has a direct impact on the country's GDP country and absorbs a significant part of the country's financial resources. 2.2 Environmental(cid:3)stakes(cid:3) From an environmental point of view Benin as a Party to the UNFCCC better will enable it to contribute concretely to the fight against climate change under its two programmatic aspects: adaptation and mitigation. In effect agro-sylvo-pastoral production systems is envisaged. These are options that aim improve and sustain the ecosystem services on which the food systems rely; production. They are community-based and pay special attention to groups vulnerable (women Although Benin is among the non-Annex A countries common but differentiated responsibility means that it is resolutely committed to contributing to the 5 Lord Nicholas Stern 6 OECD 25 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 reduction of GHG emissions. To this end energy efficiency measures carbon sequestration already initiated. Generally UNFCCC recommendations of the climate in a more strategic way to follow up on the short-term approach adopted so far with NAPAs. It is therefore a prelude to the development of the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and the CPDN It is an approach that also makes it possible to move from the project approach to the program approach. constitutes a major achievement in the transition from NAPA to NAP. With the same idea This strategy constitutes a methodological asset from which Benin will be able to develop its INDC. In effect vulnerability and identification of mitigation options finalize Benin's INDC fairly quickly. In addition, the lessons learned from this process development of the strategy will be capitalized on for the benefit of the INDC. 2.3 Geopolitical(cid:3) stakes.(cid:3) “Exercise(cid:3) inspirational(cid:3)(cid:3) leadership(cid:3) for(cid:3) meet(cid:3)the(cid:3)challenge(cid:3)of(cid:3)inaction’’(cid:3)(cid:3) Benin holds the current presidency of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) (2014-2016) and climatic.

As part of inspirational leadership environmental otherwise the costs of inaction would only be higher. Thus, in the face of the deterioration of air quality due to emissions from motorcycles its direct impact on health and the depletion of the ozone layer regulatory provisions aimed at the adoption of new types of motorcycles less polluting.

Importance of the sector in the country's economy The Government of Benin has chosen to make the agricultural sector efficient through the promotion sectors in order to fight against poverty and food and nutritional insecurity. Because Strategic Plan for the Recovery of the Agricultural Sector (PSRSA) constitutes a framework for the operationalization reference documents at national and international level to make the agricultural sector one of the essential drivers of the new dynamics of economic and social development in Benin. the PSRSA has an action plan that served as the basis for a National Investment Program Agriculture (PNIA) of Benin With a view to improving the performance of Beninese agriculture sustainably the food security of the population and contribute to economic development and social of Benin including reducing poverty by half by 2015 implements the 2011-2015 National Agricultural Investment Plan (PNIA). This plan proposes to promote the thirteen agricultural sectors defined as priorities in the PSRSA drawn up in 2008 and officially entered into force in 2012. These are: (i) maize cotton milk (CVA) by sector. Four (04) framework programs enshrined in the pact signed during the round table on the PNIA of Benin are retained for the implementation of the PSRSA/PNIA-Benin. These are: (i) Program of Agriculture Development Fisheries and Aquaculture Development Agricultural sector. These programs constitute the backbone of the programmatic framework of the PSRSA / PNIA. 28 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 According to the 2013 Activity Report peach rural available to ensure their inhabitants a healthy and decent existence”.

These options are 38 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 broken down into strategic orientations proposals for possible actions which are summarized in table 4 below. 3.4.2. Vulnerability analysis The exceptional climatic phenomena that hit Benin common to the whole sub-region. For example known Flood events have increased sharply in West Africa. In 2007 and 2009 800,000 people affected in West Africa particularly devastating with about 1 particular recorded the highest numbers of victims. The vast majority of those affected are in Benin with an estimated number of 680,000 victims, of whom 150,000 needed shelter. More specificly : - The 2010 floods in Benin had a total impact estimated at more than 127 billion FCFA or nearly 262 million USD. Damage (heritage infrastructure million USD) and losses (reduced flows business billion FCFA (about 100 million USD). -  In 2005 floors million tonnes for Mono-Couffo; 9 million tonnes for Borgou – Aliboli; 5 million tonnes for the Atlantique-Littoral. - These soil losses by erosion are aggravated by the modes of land use shifting cultivation practices on slash-and-burn with the corollary reduction of cover vegetal. - Sea level rise has already destroyed hotels crops. The ocean threatens to swallow up part of Cotonou country. According to a study published in 2007 by a British non-profit organization l’International  Institute  for  Environment  and  Development  (IIED) 39 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 could wipe off the map the areas of Donatin HOW disappearance of natural ecosystems (mangroves) and plantations (coconut trees). - In Cotonou thus swallowed up houses Beach. - The rise in sea level by submersion and erosion of the coasts has a detrimental effect on coastal human settlements.

It is with this sub-program to restore the "paths of water" obstructed in places unsuitable crossing and evacuation of water. Its implementation will be based on a plan of redevelopment of urban centers of economic and social interest and cause major losses every year. SP 7: Climate Information Early Warning System Strengthening Sub-Program and natural disaster risk management. This sub-programme will include to: a) set up a forecasting and early warning system; (b) develop including putting in place installation of water regulation structures on the main inland waterways; and c) put in put in place an emergency plan in the event of a natural disaster. It will also be develop a platform for synergy of action between the various institutions responsible for collection civil protection. 41 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 SP 8: National sub-programme for capacity building of local authorities in support of the emergence of regional hubs of resilient development in the face of climate change. This sub-program is proposed to compensate for the observed weakness of local authorities in coping to the effects of climate change will specifically support the development of new types of development plans councils that integrate the issue of climate change local development (including Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and the private sector) to techniques for dealing with climate issues at the local level pilot demonstration projects for both adaptation and mitigation. SP 9: Sub-regional sub-programme for the protection of West African coasts. This sub- program will be developed and implemented collaboratively at the sub-regional level with WAEMU. It is part of the Regional Coastal Erosion Control Program (PRLEC–UEMOA) for the monitoring of the coastline and the development of a master plan for the African coast of the West was produced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). 3.5.

Presentation of the health situation in Benin The National Health Policy and the National Health Development Plan (PNDS) for the period 2009-2018 constitute the strategic reference documents for the sector general is to “improve the state of health of the Beninese population on the basis of a system integrating poor and destitute populations”. This objective is broken down into three specific objectives 1) ensure universal access to health services and better quality of care to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); 2) strengthen the partnership for the health ; and 3) improving governance and resource management in the sector. The epidemiological profile of Benin is characterized by a predominance of communicable diseases increasing mortality linked to non-communicable diseases and maternal-infant mortality raised juvenile. This profile is determined by the quality of the living environment people their role fully. Conditions frequently encountered in consultation and not having been the subject of hospitalization are summarized in the following figure. 42 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 Figure 3: Frequency of the main conditions encountered (Source: Ministry of Health) In Benin, malaria transmission is stable throughout the country. We distinguish three main transmission zones: (i) in the southern zone transmission is heterogeneous due to the diversity of vectors holo-endemic rains from June to October. The entire population is exposed to malaria. However the children under five and pregnant women are the most vulnerable groups; and are exposed to severe forms of the disease. In 2014 consultation and 29.9% of the causes of hospitalization in health centers in Benin. Training health authorities notified 1,519,538 cases of malaria, including 1,869 deaths. Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the leading cause of death in children under less than 5 years in the world. If it is well established that the respiratory system is sensitive to variations in atmospheric conditions weather situation Benin recorded 383,833 cases of diarrheal diseases in 2014. Analysis of statistics indicates a barely noticeable increase in cases of diarrheal diseases from 2009 to 2010 2011 this rate continues to increase. 2013 is the year with the highest rate of diarrheal diseases with 387,547 cases. That same year was marked by epidemics of cholera in three of the agro-ecological zones vulnerable to the effects of climate change from country. This is zone 04 (West-Atacora/North-Donga) Zone 08 (Fisheries zone). 43 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 Geographic accessibility to health care and services is defined by the percentage of the population population living less than 5 kilometers from a health center. In Benin as a whole households have access to a health facility in their locality within a radius of 5 km. Is about accessibility to first referral health facilities population have access to a referral hospital if necessary; 13% of the populations live still more than 30 km from a referral hospital. The majority of rural communities do not have no hospital within 5 km (34% against 77% for urban areas). 3.5.2. Vulnerability analysis According to the 3rd Africa Environment Outlook Report (AEO 3) Global warming is changing more in Africa than elsewhere in the world. This observation of the AEO 3 derives from the concrete evidence gathered from the Group's 4th assessment report Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This growing trend makes climate change the single most important health and economic challenge facing the continent to face. Weather-sensitive diseases could easily spread under the effect of generalized global warming (Guernier et al. 2004). In effect ascending in Benin with in particular: diarrheal diseases and malaria dependent on flooding of the coastal zone and lowlands severe droughts in the northern region of the country schistosomiasis endemic to ponds heated by the sun.

Diagnosis(cid:3)of(cid:3)sector(cid:3)of(cid:3)resources(cid:3)in(cid:3)water(cid:3) 3.6.1. Importance of the sector The Republic of Benin receives an average annual volume of rain which varies from North to South of 800mm to 1200mm. This rainwater is drained by a hydrographic network relatively dense but most streams have an intermittent flow regime characterized by high flood flows and zero low flow. Internal and external water supply amount to about 13 The current rate of mobilization of water resources is around 0 groundwater (approximately 80 million m3 of water mobilized per year over 1 and 0 billion m3 of water available). These mobilization rates are very low in the face of many needs still not satisfied. If the drinking water needs established urban environment in 2014 and put Benin on the path to achieving the MDGs performance in other water-related needs (agricultural water hydroelectricity information is available to characterize the situation. With regard to the mobilization of 40 million m3 of surface water counted in Benin, barely half of which are still functional. Apart from the water retention of the SUCOBE (formerly Société Sucrière de Savè) which produces 24 million m3 of water alone drinking water from the Okpara (for the city of Parakou) which has about 3 million m3 of water and the very recent Sépunga hydro-agricultural dam in Tanguiéta which contains 1 million m3 of water. It's about generally very small works whose individual capacity varies from a few thousand to several tens of thousands of m3 of water. Since the adoption of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) as an approach to development of water resources in 1998 Benin has four hydrographic units namely Niger Mono / Couffo. 46 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 Benin's water resources management framework is defined by four main documents strategies: the National Drinking Water Supply Strategy (SNAEP) National Integrated Water Resources Management (PANGIRE) Water Development and Management (SDAGE) of the Ouémé River The most inclusive strategic water resources development planning plan in these potential adaptation options of the sector hydroelectric dams on the main course and twenty-seven (27) medium and small dams on the tributaries both sector development concerns and poverty reduction adaptation and then mitigation. 3.6.2. Analysis of vulnerability and adaptation options The development of the water resources sector is influenced by the following climate risks : i) drought late rains then v) sea level rise. At these risks filling of watercourses the water ; c) modification of the vegetation cover; d) modification of land use the effect of runoff; and (e) low purchasing power of the population. The surface water resources sub-sector is the most vulnerable Drinking Water Supply (AEP). Women and girls are the most vulnerable to map of social groups. To reduce the current and future vulnerability of the water resource sector to changes potential adaptation options identified can be summarized in three categories: i) the management of water needs (irrigation needs and needs of human settlements); ii) improving the offer; then Table 6: Water Resources Sector Vulnerability and Adaptation Analysis Matrix ALAFIA 2025 Theme: Human and material bases of sustainable development Base Sub-theme: Promotion of the economy (productivity and prosperity challenge) programmatic Water Development and Management Master Plan (SDAGE) of the river Ouémé - Construction of three (03) large hydroelectric dams on the course 47 Low Carbon Development Strategy and resilient to climate change in Benin 2016 - 2025 principal - Construction of twenty-seven (27) medium and small dams on the tributaries Climatic factors: Flooding Types and levels of climate risks Intensity: Medium to High Units Manifestation and Impacts Root Causes Prevention Options and of Protective Exposures - High vulnerability - Fluctuation of - Installation of work - Reduction of the course bed rainfall (in addition to water retention and management water due to siltation that causes flooding - water erosion watersheds - Change in the plan for - Reduction of cover Surface water streams with vegetation reduction in availability - Low level of during episodes of water mobilization drought potential reduction hydroelectric - Low vulnerability - Reduction of - Drilling of boreholes - Refilling of rainfall aquifers Underground waters water tables reduced in - Reduction of cover plant drought period - Medium vulnerability - Low level of - Creation of reservoirs - Accentuation of water control and water supply drudgery of water which affects more drinking and strengthening of Supply women and children capacities of populations in drinking water - Resurgence of local diseases in their management waterborne due to sustainable poor water quality 3.6.3.

The next step was to identify the activities to be carried out at the community level to fight against impacts of identified risks. But the budgets of these municipalities generally remain derisory and no large-scale activities are often carried out within this framework made in the Annual Work Plan (PTA). It should be noted that only a few municipalities have been able to implement an integration process climate change in their PDC has not yet been able to integrate climate issues, in particular by using a methodology and relevant tools adapted assessment of current and future vulnerability adaptation options and then their planning in the PDC.
