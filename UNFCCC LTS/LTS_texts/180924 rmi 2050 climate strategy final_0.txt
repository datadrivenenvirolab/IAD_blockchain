and his vision to produce this 2050 Strategy. 
Foreword 
 
As  seafaring  people  we  know  that  a  long  journey  requires  careful  navigation.  In 
beginning to ask ourselves what kind of country we want to live in by the middle of this 
century, our 2050 Climate Strategy provides us with a compass that we can use to travel 
with confidence and along a steady course. And by ensuring that it is a dynamic, living 
document, we will improve the Strategy over time, allowing us to carry out our journey 
with increasing precision as we get closer to our destination.  
Under the Paris Agreement that my country was proud to have played a key role in 
helping secure, every country should strive to formulate and communicate long-term 
low greenhouse gas emission development strategies, and to do so by 2020. These 
“2050 Strategies” will be essential for each country to set a clear direction of travel and 
provide a domestic context in which to progressively raise ambition in a manner that is 
consistent with achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Quite simply, the five-year 
cycles of the Paris Agreement will only ever yield the necessary increases in climate 
ambition if coupled with each country setting a long-term vision that it works towards 
achieving.    
In  producing  our  own  2050  Strategy,  we  wanted  to  set  a  clear  framework  for 
progressing towards net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, as well as transitioning 
to an economy and society that is resilient and can adapt to the inevitable impacts of 
climate change. But most importantly, we wanted to do this in a way that promotes 
sustainable development and the future well-being of the Marshallese people – women, 
men and youth. The process of producing our 2050 Strategy has of itself been a useful 
experience. 
In my experience long journeys require many partners. We therefore invite everyone to 
consider how they may be able to support the Marshall Islands in our own journey, but 
also ask those countries that have not yet produced their own 2050 Strategies to start 
that process and discover for themselves the possibilities and opportunities they can 
reveal.

The Marshall Islands – a Context 
 
1.  The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) is one of the world’s lowest-lying and 
climate vulnerable countries. It is a coral atoll nation comprising 1,156 individual 
islands/islets and 29 different atolls with an average elevation of just six feet 
above sea level, dispersed across nearly two million square kilometers of the 
Pacific Ocean. The national population is almost 53,000 and the national Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) is approximately US$180 million, driven overwhelmingly 
by external assistance from the Compact of Free Association relationship with the 
United  States  and  remittances.  National  industry  and  agriculture,  including 
fisheries and especially tuna, account for less than 15% of economic activity. 
2.  Gaining independence in 1986, after a long period of contestation and occupation, 
RMI is now a stable and peaceful democracy. However, the impacts of 67 different 
nuclear tests are still felt. These tests, conducted by the US in the period following 
World War II when RMI was a UN Trusteeship Territory, were roughly equivalent 
in energy terms to 1.6 Hiroshima detonations every day for 12 years. 
3.  While  RMI  may  only  contribute  0.00001%  of  global  greenhouse  gas  (GHG) 
emissions, the country has a proud history of prominent climate leadership, both 
at home and on the world stage. Following a global fuel price spike in 2008, RMI 
declared a National Economic Emergency and has since then rapidly embraced 
renewable energy technologies and taken huge strides in energy efficiency. For 
example, more than 90% of the country’s outer islands have now been completely 
solarized. The country is also embarking on a major solar project for Ebeye (one of 
two major urban centers) on Kwajalein Atoll, and four other atolls. Additional 
stability improvements in the electricity grid are still required to allow further 
penetration of renewable energy in urban areas. 
4.  On the international stage, RMI spearheaded the 2013 Majuro Declaration for 
Climate Leadership, which sought to demonstrate the Pacific’s adoption of some 
of the world’s most ambitious GHG emissions reduction targets. In 2015 it played 
a key role in securing the Paris Agreement on climate change, including as the 
founder of the High Ambition Coalition (HAC) which it continues to convene. RMI 
assumed Presidency of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) in August 2018. 
5.  RMI is at the front of the front line in the battle against climate change, and its 
front line is its last line of defense. As one of the countries most vulnerable to 
climate change, adapting to climate impacts is an increasingly pressing national 
priority, including with respect to women, men and children in rural communities 
who  have  limited  access  to  resources  and  services  and  so  are  particularly 
vulnerable.  
6.  The country is experiencing increasingly damaging effects from climate change 
and seeing more frequent and intense events, such as drought, floods and swells, 
and tropical cyclones and storms. RMI declared a State of Disaster in 2013 and 
2016 as a result of prolonged and unseasonal droughts. The Post Disaster Needs 
Assessment (PDNA) from the 2016 drought estimated the total economic losses to 
be approximately US$4.9 million, with agriculture being the single most affected 
Page 6   
sector. In 2015, Typhoon Nangka cost RMI more than 3% of its GDP in a single 
night. As king tides become more frequent and intense, salt water is increasingly 
seeping into fresh water lenses, creating urgent challenges for the islands. Raising 
support to assist with adaptation efforts remains a significant challenge. 
7.  RMI has matched its international leadership in calling for greater ambition with 
equally ambitious domestic action. In 2015 RMI became the first Small Island 
Developing State (SIDS) to table its post-2020 Nationally Determined Contribution 
(NDC). This committed the country to a 32% reduction of GHG emissions by 2025, 
based on 2010 levels. It also made an indicative commitment to reduce  GHG 
emissions by 45% by 2030, based on 2010 levels, thereby setting a projected 
straight-line intended NDC trajectory to achieve RMI’s stated aspiration of net 
zero GHG emissions by 2050. The NDC was ground breaking in that it contained 
the first economy-wide absolute GHG emissions reduction target against a base 
year by a developing country. 
8.  In 2016 RMI also committed, under the Marrakech Partnership, to achieving 100% 
renewable energy by 2050. RMI has reiterated its aspiration to achieve net zero 
GHG emissions by 2050, including most recently through signing the Declaration of 
the Carbon Neutrality Coalition at the One Planet Summit in December 2017. 
9.  The  purpose  of  this  2050  Climate  Strategy  –  which  is  RMI’s  long-term  low 
greenhouse gas emission climate-resilient development strategy under the Paris 
Agreement - is to outline a long-term pathway for RMI to achieve its objectives 
for  net  zero  emissions  and  100%  renewable  energy,  as  well  as  to  facilitate 
adaptation and climate resilience in a way that ensures the future protection 
and prosperity of the country and its women, men and youth.

Section 1 – Executive Summary 
 
Key Recommendations  
 
 
In order to achieve its objectives for net zero emissions by 2050 and 100% 
renewable energy, as well as to adapt to the impacts of climate change and 
achieve resilience in a way that ensures future protection and prosperity of 
RMI, this 2050 Strategy makes the following recommendations:  
  Submit, by 2020 at the latest, a new NDC in which, in the context of the 
necessary means of implementation being available, RMI: 
  revises  its  quantified  economy-wide  target  to  reduce  its 
emissions of GHGs to at least 32% below 2010 levels by 2025; 
  commits  to  a  quantified  economy-wide  target  to  reduce  its 
emissions of GHGs to at least 45% below 2010 levels by 2030;  
  communicates an indicative target to reduce its emissions of 
GHGs by at least 58% below 2010 levels by 2035; 
  reaffirms its aspiration to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 
2050 at the latest, 
  commits to producing a National Adaptation Plan by the end of 
2019 at the latest that sets out short, medium and long-term 
milestones  to  adapt  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change  and 
transition  to  climate  resilience,  suggests  implementation 
measures  and  includes  a  plan  to  generate  the  necessary 
financing; 
  commits to submitting an  Adaptation Communication to the 
UNFCCC by 2020 at the latest; 
  commits  to  a  gender-responsive  and  human  rights-based 
approach  in  all  NDC-related  planning,  programming  and 
implementation; and 
  commits to using the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) Guidelines (currently 2006). 
  Focus  in  the  short  and  medium  term  on  RMI’s  electricity  sector  to 
implement GHG reductions consistent with achieving its NDC targets; 
  Act  to  reduce  RMI’s  growing  waste  problem  by  minimizing  organic 
material in collected waste and consider possibilities to generate energy 
Page 8   
from waste; 
  Develop polices to encourage a greater use of public transport, cycling 
and walking, and the increased uptake of electric vehicles; 
  Explore options to reduce GHG emissions from domestic ocean-based 
transport, including improved regulatory control; 
  Continue  efforts  to  phase  out  the  use  of  kerosene  for  lighting  and 
strengthen  existing  institutional  arrangements  to  reduce  GHGs  from 
cooking and lighting; 
  Establish a long-term finance strategy to implement this 2050 Strategy 
and its recommendations; and identify and consider options for a more 
coordinated  and  centralized  approach  to  applying  for,  and  monitor, 
related overseas aid and investment; 
  Ensure due diligence is fulfilled before making significant investments to 
implement this 2050 Strategy and its recommendations; 
  Prioritize capacity building in all areas relevant for the implementation 
of this 2050 Strategy and its recommendations; 
  Mainstream  gender  and  human  rights,  including  in  relation  to 
developing,  adopting,  reviewing  and  implementing  laws,  policies  and 
projects related to climate change, and commission further analysis with 
a view to putting in place a strategy to improve related data collection, 
monitoring and evaluation;  
  Include  health  considerations  as  part  of  RMI’s  forthcoming  National 
Adaptation Plan; 
  Include education, training & public awareness considerations as part of 
RMI’s forthcoming National Adaptation Plan; 
  Review  and  update,  as  necessary,  this  2050  Strategy  as  a  minimum 
every five years – including to recommend targets for inclusion in future 
NDCs – at least one year before RMI submits future NDCs; and 
  Establish a domestic process to oversee reviews and updates to this 
2050 Strategy, as well as to monitor its implementation.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
 
1.  RMI’s GHG emissions – as presented in the Second National Communication1 
(August  2015)  –  can  be  broken  down  into  four  key  sectors:  electricity; 
transportation (land and sea); waste; and cooking & lighting.  
2.  The  following  sections  will  outline  illustrative  decarbonization  scenarios  and 
pathways  for  each  individual  sector  and,  where  appropriate,  suggest  specific 
considerations for RMI’s major population centers (Majuro, Ebeye, Wotje, Jaluit, 
and Kili) and the outer islands.  
3.  RMI produced its NDC in 2015. The key GHG provisions of the NDC state that: 
  RMI  commits  to  a  quantified  economy-wide  target  to  reduce  its 
emissions of GHGs to 32% below 2010 levels by 2025; 
  RMI communicates, as an indicative target, its intention to reduce its 
emissions of GHGs to 45% below 2010 levels by 2030; 
  These targets put RMI on a trajectory to nearly halve GHG emissions 
between  2010  and  2030,  with  a  view  to  achieving  net  zero  GHG 
emissions by 2050, or earlier if possible.  
4.  Essentially this represents a  straight-line intended trajectory from the  current 
2025 target to zero GHG emissions in 2050 (see NDC trajectory in Figure 1 below). 
Figure 1: RMI Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions – NDC Trajectory and Scenarios

Page 1 0  
5.  RMI’s  current  NDC  targets  are  highly  ambitious  and  will  require  significant 
additional efforts, as well as additional means of implementation, to achieve. 
Nevertheless, this 2050 Strategy proposes targets for a new and more ambitious 
NDC consistent with the straight-line intended emissions reduction trajectory from 
the 2025 target to net zero in 2050 (see below).  
6.  RMI has been clear – as reflected in its 2015 NDC – that its GHG targets represent 
a floor, and not a ceiling, to ambition. In that context, and in order to illustrate 
examples of how RMI might further raise ambition and to do so more quickly, this 
2050 Strategy also includes three illustrative Scenarios for RMI’s GHG emissions:   
  a  "Moderate"  enhanced  ambition  Scenario,  reflecting  technically  and 
economically feasible targets;  
  an  intermediate  "Significant"  enhanced  ambition  Scenario,  which  is 
equivalent to the Lighthouse Scenario, but is delayed by 15 years due to 
presumed lack of funding; and 
  a "Lighthouse" enhanced ambition Scenario, which is technically feasible but 
more expensive. 
7.  Each of the illustrative Scenarios (see Figure 1) is defined in more detail in the 
Section 2 of this 2050 Strategy. The purpose of these Scenarios is to:  
  provide illustrative examples of the range of options available, and the kind 
of measures that might need to be implemented to achieve them, as well as 
to suggest next steps; 
  provoke discussions as to what might be the best way forward for RMI to 
contribute to achieving the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement; 
  facilitate making progress towards achieving RMI’s aspiration of net zero 
GHG emissions by 2050. 
8.  This 2050 Strategy is intended to provide a framework under which more detailed 
implementation plans, strategies and projects can be developed. In that context it 
is important, when considering measures and next steps to implement this 2050 
Strategy, that reference is also made to RMI’s forthcoming NDC Partnership Plan, 
and  to  keep  in  mind  that  for  the  electricity  sector  specific  implementation 
measures will be set out in RMI’s forthcoming Electricity Roadmap. 
 
Main Points 
9.  Achieving RMI’s 2025 NDC target and indicative 2030 NDC target is possible under 
the assumptions outlined in this 2050 Strategy. In both the Lighthouse and the 
Significant Scenarios, RMI would essentially meet its indicative 2030 NDC goal. 
RMI could achieve up to an 87% reduction in GHG emissions in the Lighthouse 
Scenario by 2050, without using any offsets. A pathway to eliminate remaining 
emissions and achieve 100% reductions by 2050 is not clear due to currently 
unavoidable GHG emissions from waste. But in future planning efforts, RMI can 
evaluate additional new technology options, carbon sinks, or offsets.  
Page 1 1  
10.  On the basis of the current NDC, and consistent with the straight-line intended 
emissions reductions trajectory from the 2025 target to net zero in 2050, as well 
as the content and underpinning analysis of this 2050 Strategy, it is recommended 
that – in accordance with the legally binding requirement of the Paris Agreement 
– RMI submits by March 2020, at the latest, a new NDC in which it: 
  revises its quantified economy-wide target to reduce its emissions of 
GHGs by 2025 to be at least 32% below 2010 levels. Changing its 
current 2025 target to an “at least” target is consistent with RMI’s wish 
to overachieve on its 2025 target, and to further raise ambition and do 
so more quickly, should the means of implementation to do so be 
available; 
  commits to a quantified economy-wide target to reduce its emissions 
of GHGs to at least 45% below 2010 levels by 2030. In doing this, RMI 
will make trying to achieve its previously indicative 2030 target binding 
under the Paris Agreement;  
  communicates,  as  an  indicative  target,  its  intention  to  reduce  its 
emissions of GHGs by at least 58% below 2010 levels by 2035. This 
indicative target would be consistent with RMI’s straight-line intended 
NDC emissions reduction trajectory from the 2025 target to net zero in 
2050,  and  so  represents  consistent  momentum  in  RMI’s  GHG 
emissions reductions efforts. 
11.  By specifying that targets in its future NDC will be “at least” targets, RMI will send 
a clear signal of intent to try to overachieve against them, and that they are a floor 
for ambition, not a ceiling. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that achieving 
even RMI’s existing ambitious NDC targets will require the necessary means of 
implementation to be available. Going beyond these and overachieving against 
targets will clearly require the availability of further means of implementation. At 
the same time, the transition to renewable energy could present net future cost 
savings  from  reduced  imports  of  fossil  fuels  and  bring  other  co-benefits,  for 
example. 
12.  It is worth pointing out that  RMI has already undertaken significant steps to 
reduce its GHG emissions. Its emissions peaked in 2009, and the National Energy 
Policy and Energy  Action  Plan  identifies  a  comprehensive  list  of  strategies  to 
further reduce GHG emissions. To maintain this momentum, this 2050 Strategy 
recommends undertaking studies and pilot projects, which focus on the actions 
with the highest potential to transform RMI’s energy usage and accelerate the 
shift away from emissions-intensive practices, towards net zero emissions by 
2050.  
13.  With strategic and adaptive management, RMI can achieve significant emissions 
reductions  and  solidify  its  climate  leadership  position.  In  its  2009  and  2016 
National Energy Plans, RMI outlined national goals for energy use that move the 
country toward achievement of its 100% decarbonization vision by 2050. The 
electricity sector has by far the greatest potential to rapidly reduce RMI’s GHG 
emissions  in  line  with  its  2025  and  2030  NDC  targets.  The  pathway  to  a 
Page 1 2  
sustainable  green  energy  mix  and  to  further  decarbonizing  the  electricity 
generation sector will be set out in RMI’s forthcoming Electricity Roadmap.  
 
Further Detail 
14.  This 2050 Strategy shows that by 2050, RMI can nearly achieve its goal of reaching 
zero emissions. In order to achieve these results without the use of GHG offsets, 
significant changes to energy policy and in-use technologies are needed.  
15.  A comparison of the NDC to the three illustrative Scenarios in 2030 and 2050 
shows the following projection on 2010 levels: 
 
  2030  2050 
NDC   45% reduction  100% reduction 
Moderate Scenario  47% reduction  56% reduction 
Significant Scenario   54% reduction  70% reduction 
Lighthouse Scenario  60% reduction   87% reduction 
 
16.  Among the three  Scenarios, the Lighthouse Scenario gets RMI closest to its 
stated aim of net zero GHG emissions by 2050 (see Figure 4).  
17.  After  2025,  the  three  Scenarios  diverge  significantly  in  terms  of  achieved 
emissions reductions. This means that if ambitious action is delayed, emissions 
reductions would need to be more aggressive in the future in order to achieve 
net zero emissions by 2050. Internationally it is generally accepted that delayed 
action would ultimately incur greater overall costs – although this would need 
further analysis, taking into account the specific circumstances of RMI. 
18.  Decisions  regarding  how  a  Lighthouse  ambition  reduction  strategy  could  be 
pursued will depend on a number of factors including:  
  current and projected future technology costs (e.g. energy storage);  
  the relatively higher costs of delaying action and still achieving net zero 
emissions reductions by 2050;  
  RMI’s international leadership on climate change; and 
  access to financing and other means of implementation. 
19.  In  the  Lighthouse  Scenario,  the  addition  of  energy  storage  allows  renewable 
penetration to reach 100% of electricity generation. Electric vehicles would tend 
to  eliminate  land  transportation  emissions,  and  electricity  for  cooking 
substitutions would tend to eliminate “other” emissions.  
Page 1 3  
20.  While  waste  emissions  can  be  reduced  through  recycling  and  landfill 
improvements,  they  cannot  be  eliminated  entirely  due  to  the  limitations  of 
current  technologies  and  policy  options.  Therefore,  even  under  a  Lighthouse 
emissions reductions Scenario, reaching net zero emissions by 2050 is currently 
not feasible. Offsetting residual emissions from waste could be considered, and 
more sustainable technologies may, of course, emerge in the future.  
 
Adaptation & Climate Resilience 
 
21.  As  one  of  the  world’s  most  climate  vulnerable  nations,  adaptation  will  be  a 
constant requirement for RMI, even if the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global 
temperature increases to no more than 1.5°C is achieved. It is difficult to predict 
exactly what adaptation needs there will be based on how high the temperature 
might rise and therefore it is important to apply the precautionary principle in 
planning.   
22.  RMI  has  historically  developed  adaptation  policies  based  on  immediate  and 
foreseen requirements, hence there is an urgent need to review and consolidate 
policies and measures on adaptation and climate resilience.  A systematic and 
integrated  approach that  combines  climate  and  disaster  risk  considerations  is 
needed to build resilience across the entire country and economy. This should 
happen around three pillars: 
  a clear sense of strategic principals and priorities; 
  an  understanding  of  current  and  future  climate  change  risks  and 
impacts; 
  a phased and adaptive approach to action. 
23.  In that light, RMI should start, as soon as possible, the process to develop a 
National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and complete it by the end of 2019 at the latest.  
24.  The NAP should: 
  incorporate adaptation and climate resilience milestones to be achieved, 
for example by 2020, 2025, 2030 and 2050, as well as suggest measures to 
achieve them; 
  elaborate in detail immediate, accelerated gender-responsive actions and 
investments over the next five years (2019-2023) to adapt to the impacts 
of climate change and transition to climate resilience; 
  suggest,  as  appropriate,  updates  to  relevant  national  policies  and 
legislation; 
  set out a plan for significant investments in adaptation and resilience in 
order to be in a position to fully implement its recommendations; and 
Page 1 4  
  incorporate, as appropriate, the key recommendations arising from the 
review of the Joint National Action Plan on climate change adaptation and 
disaster risk management (JNAP).  
25.  The NAP should set out in detail RMI’s policy for domestic planning purposes. On 
the international front, RMI should submit an Adaptation Communication, based 
on the NAP, to the UNFCCC by 2020 at the latest. That Communication should 
concisely set out RMI’s contribution towards meeting the adaptation goal set out 
in  the  Paris  Agreement,  and  the  required  means  of  implementation  to  fully 
implement that contribution. 
26.  Both  the  commitment  to  produce  the  NAP  and  subsequent  Adaptation 
Communication should be set out in RMI’s forthcoming NDC. 
27.  A significant barrier to implementing RMI’s current and future adaptation and 
resilience  measures  is  long-term  predictable  and  adequate  financing.  Because 
private sector finance is particularly hard to secure in this area, public sector 
funding from the international climate donor and development sector must be the 
focus.  
 
Means of Implementation 
 
28.  In order to more effectively attract investment in relation to implementing RMI’s 
NDC, its future NAP as well other aspects of this 2050 Strategy, a long-term 
climate finance strategy needs to be put in place. That long-term finance strategy 
will need to  help prioritize and target funding  applications in a strategic and 
coordinated way, and it should be regularly reviewed and monitored to deliver 
against key objectives. 
29.  Unless  more  effective  oversight  and  coordination  is  put  in  place,  including 
establishing a clear mechanism to enable and improve the efficiency of Overseas 
Development Assistance (ODA) coordination, RMI’s ability to attract necessary 
levels of future climate finance consistent with domestic priorities is likely to be 
significantly  constrained.  It  is  therefore  recommended  that  the  Government 
urgently considers how to deliver a more coordinated and centralized approach 
to applying for, and monitoring, overseas aid and investment. 
30.  At the same time, means of implementation for short term action in line with the 
priorities  of  this  2050  Strategy  is  also  critical.  Implementation  of  RMI’s  NDC 
Partnership Plan, which identifies the immediate priorities for action and existing 
gaps, and coordinates support from partners to achieve these priorities, will be 
very important. This can and should be leveraged over time to enhance donor 
support toward implementation of future NDCs and this 2050 Strategy.  
31.  In  general  terms  capacity  and  resource  constraints  are  a  significant  factor 
restricting RMI’s ability to access international climate-related assistance. This is 
an issue that needs to be urgently addressed and in-country capacity building and 
institutional strengthening should be prioritized in this area.   
Page 1 5  
Transparency, Environmental & Social Information  
 
32.  Good  quality  data  and  information  management  and  monitoring  systems  are 
crucial  for  informed  policy  development  and  to  measure  progress  towards 
achieving  goals,  and  to  enable  results-oriented  policy,  investment  and 
development  planning.  Lack  of  reliable,  high  quality  and  accessible  data  will, 
unless addressed, be a very significant barrier to RMI achieving its climate change 
objectives as set out in its NDC and this 2050 Strategy. This is a consistently 
recurring issue in relation to every aspect and sector addressed by this  2050 
Strategy. 
33.  In that context it should be noted that some of the analysis and recommendations 
in this 2050 Strategy are based on RMI’s GHG inventory as set out in its Second 
National Communication. That inventory should be officially updated and set out 
in  RMI’s  future  Third  National  Communication.  The  2050  Strategy  and  its 
recommendations can be accordingly revised in future to reflect the updated 
emissions inventory. 
34.  Therefore, institutional arrangements and the roles and responsibilities for data 
collection,  management,  monitoring,  analysis  and  dissemination  should  be 
reviewed and policies put in place to ensure that a more effective system is 
implemented.  RMI  should  aspire  to  using  the  latest  IPCC  Guidelines  where 
relevant. 
35.  Capacity building in this area should be a priority, and international funding and 
technical  assistance  already  available  or  set  aside  for  this  purpose  should  be 
accessed, and further assistance sought as needed. 
36.  RMI should also prioritize producing and submitting its Biennial Update Report 
and its Third National Communication, and should aim to do so at the latest by the 
end of 2019. 
 
Gender and Human Rights  
 
37.  Social considerations — including the differentiated impacts of climate change and 
the response initiatives on women, men and youth — should be systematically 
integrated into all climate change policy, planning and implementation. Women 
are disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change  due to their 
marginalized status in global society which limits their access, use and control over 
resources and services.  
38.  This 2050 Strategy finds there to be a need to mainstream gender considerations 
and a human rights-based approach in all aspects of RMI’s policy and legislative 
development, adoption and implementation in relation to climate change. An 
initial step is to increase gender-differentiated and disaggregated data collection 
to  identify  gaps,  needs  and  opportunities  for  women,  men,  youth  and 
marginalized  and  vulnerable  groups  to  address  gender  and  social  inequities, 
Page 1 6  
particularly in rural remote communities. Further expert input should be sought to 
further improve these aspects – including in future revisions of this 2050 Strategy. 
A strategy should be developed to progressively ensure RMI’s full compliance with 
its human rights obligations.   
39.  Women, men, and youth should be included and engaged as valuable stakeholders 
in identifying and addressing the climate change concerns of their communities 
and to share knowledge for responses to ensure their strengthened resilience. 
Further support should also be commissioned from gender organizations in RMI, 
as well as gender and human rights experts in advocacy, engagement and capacity 
building, and for enhancing sector-specific gender considerations. 
 
Approach and Future Perspectives 
 
40.  In producing this 2050 Strategy, stakeholders were of the view that existing RMI 
legislation,  measures  and  policies  should  be  built  upon,  and  that  inefficient 
duplication  and  replication  should  be  avoided.  Stakeholders  also  expressed  a 
strong view that it should not be a one-off document but improved over time. 
41.  A key recommendation is that this 2050 Strategy is reviewed and updated, as 
necessary, every five years as a minimum, including to identify new and relevant 
technologies and policy options. More immediately, once the key outcomes and 
recommendations from the 2nd National Climate Dialogue and the Partnership 
Dialogue held in July 2018, have been identified, they should be collected and 
used in the implementation of this 2050 Strategy as well as to inform future 
updates. Additional comments received in the future from stakeholders of all 
levels should be similarly collected and used. In that sense the 2050 Strategy 
should be treated as a living document. As such, it will be critical that the key 
findings of this 2050 Strategy are disseminated and feedback sought from a range 
of stakeholders. 
42.  Furthermore, updates to the 2050 Strategy should recommend the targets for 
future RMI NDCs one year in advance of their submission to the UNFCCC in line 
with  the  requirements  of  the  Paris  Agreement.  The  recommendation  process 
should include stakeholder consultation. 
43. The  Tile  Til  Eo  Committee  (TTE  Committee)  was  established  to  facilitate  the 
production of this 2050 Strategy and it has proved valuable outside of the 2050 
Strategy remit as well. The Committee and this 2050 Strategy were given the name 
Tile Til Eo, meaning 'lighting the way' in Marshallese, to signify both the pathway to 
the country's zero emissions future and also the example which RMI hopes others 
can follow. 
44.  Consideration should be given to maintaining the TTE Committee. In any event, 
the TTE Committee or another body should have a future role in: 
  monitoring the alignment and consistency of relevant legislation, policies 
and measures with the 2050 Strategy; 
Page 1 7  
  overseeing the update of the 2050 Strategy every five years – including the 
goals it contains; 
  monitoring progress towards achievement of RMI’s current NDC; and 
  recommending the targets and goals of future RMI NDCs. 
45.  It is strongly recommended that the TTE Committee or other body should be as 
independent  of  day-to-day  Government  decision-making  as  possible,  so  as  to 
enhance  the  credibility  of  its  functions  and  to  maximize  the  possibility  of 
considering  and  advising  on  politically  sensitive  issues  in  making  future 
recommendations. International policy and legislative frameworks such as the 
United Kingdom’s Climate Change Act and Climate Change Committee should be 
considered. Further thoughts are set out in Section 9.

Headline Recommendations 
 
  Focus – particularly in the short and medium term – on the electricity 
sector to implement GHG emissions reductions targets; 
  Complete and implement RMI’s Electricity Roadmap, which will provide 
further detail on least-cost technology pathways for how the electricity 
sector can be further decarbonized; 
  Invest  in  electricity  grid  upgrades  to  improve  grid  stability,  minimize 
system  losses  and  accommodate  more  variable  generation  from 
renewable energy; 
  Undertake a feasibility study to assess the potential for vehicle to grid 
electricity  storage,  which  would  provide  dual  benefits  of  reducing 
transportation emissions and providing stability to the grid. RMI should 
also consider thermal storage options;  
  Review the governance relationship between the RMI Government and 
the  electric  utilities,  including  to  ensure  national  mandates  are 
implemented by the electricity generating sector; and 
  Consider passing an Energy Sector Management Act to clarify powers and 
responsibilities  among  Government  agencies  to  streamline 
decarbonization policies across the energy sector.    
 
 
Summary  
47.  The electricity sector has by far the greatest potential to rapidly reduce RMI’s GHG 
emissions  in  line  with  its  2025  and  2030  NDC  targets.  As  such  RMI’s 
decarbonization pathway relies primarily on transitioning the electricity sector 
away from fossil fuels. It is estimated that at least 10% of RMI’s GDP is spent on 
importing fossil fuels for electricity generation alone. This represents a significant 
national cost. Furthermore, the heavy reliance on fossil fuel imports represents a 
highly significant energy security risk. Being at the end of the supply chain due to 
its  remote  location,  RMI  is  highly  susceptible  to  changes  in  supply  due  to 
geopolitical shocks or fuel price spikes.  
48.  At present, electricity generation is almost exclusively reliant on diesel fuel. While 
a full-scale shift to renewable energy is imperative, in the short to medium-term, 
RMI must leverage a combination of demand and supply-side reductions to reduce 
GHG emissions and facilitate the long-term transition.  
49.  Current policies only look out to 2020 – and not to 2025 or 2030 – and therefore 
do not fully implement RMI’s NDC. Policies in the energy sector will need to be 
Page 2 1  
developed – based on solid analysis – that look well beyond 2020. These will need 
to  be  accompanied  by  a  solid  and  rigorous  long-term  financial  plan.  The 
forthcoming Electricity Roadmap will be a positive step towards addressing some 
of these concerns. 
50.  Majuro, home to RMI’s largest electricity grid, must undertake a combination of: 
  upgrading the electricity grid to reduce system losses; 
  pursuing demand-side energy efficiency upgrades; 
  replacing existing diesel generators with high speed engines; 
  increasing solar and wind penetration on the grid; and 
  installing storage capacity.   
51.  Upgrading the grid could bring much needed supply-side efficiency improvements 
and  also  accommodate  projected  increases  in  demand  from  new  industrial 
facilities  (e.g.  a  proposed  fish  processing  plant  in  Majuro)  and  potential 
electrification of land-based transportation. Upgrading the grid is also a necessary 
step to allow for more variable generation (e.g. wind and solar).  
52.  It is estimated that there  are up to 30% energy losses in the current grid  – 
although there are a lot of uncertainties around this figure, which is based on 
comparing production and billing. These losses are made up of: 
•  energy ‘lost’ to run the power station – estimated to be about 7%; 
•  distribution network losses through transmission lines and transformers 
– estimated to be about 7%; and 
•  energy theft – estimated to be around 15%. 
53.  It may be technically feasible to reduce losses to as little as 5%. As such, reducing 
grid losses could provide RMI with significant cost savings and GHG emissions 
reduction potential. Policies should be urgently developed to address this. New 
electricity meters, for example, would facilitate a better understanding of energy 
losses by comparing what comes out of transformers to what is billed. 
54.  Demand-side  efficiency  improvements  should  also  be  considered,  such  as 
appliance standards for air conditioning units and building code reforms to reduce 
electricity demand for cooling.  
55.  RMI should consider novel and variable tariff structures for electricity consumers – 
to maximize social access to energy and lower costs for all citizens while dis-
incentivizing overuse. The current policy of providing landowners with 1000KwH 
free per month should be reviewed for consistency with trying to curtail GHG 
emissions through reduced energy use. 
56.  Policies will also need to be developed in relation to independent producers of 
renewable  energy,  including  in  relation  to  possible  feed-in  tariffs.  A  lack  of 
regulation in this area could be problematic in terms of developing grid capacity 
for renewable energy in a logical and planned way. The impact of independent 
renewable energy production on the Marshall Energy Company (MEC) will also 
need to be considered. 
Page 2 2  
57.  Current  diesel  engines  are  manually  controlled  and  incompatible  with  high 
penetration of renewable energy on the present grid system. Installing high-speed 
diesel  engines  would be  needed  to  address  supply  fluctuations  from  variable 
generation until adequate energy storage is added to the grid. As such, an upgrade 
to diesel generation would facilitate greater penetration of renewable energy. As 
the  penetration  of  renewable  energy  increases,  the  use  of  diesel  could  be 
downscaled – provided that the right kind of diesel generators are chosen at the 
outset.  In  the  future  these  engines  could  theoretically  be  run  on  biodiesel, 
although  this  would  not  reduce  RMI’s  GHG  emissions  unless  procured  from 
sustainable sources.  
58.  RMI also has extensive coconut oil production (copra), which can potentially be 
used as either a renewable fuel for transportation or for electricity generation. 
However, there is limited land area available and copra is a key source of foreign 
exchange  and  economic  prosperity  for  RMI.  As  a  starting  point  for  national 
discussion, it has been assumed that 50% of the available crop could in future be 
devoted to electricity generation. For this to make economic sense, world copra 
prices need to be lower than diesel prices. This use of copra can complement 
renewables, providing power during cloud cover, at night, and during low wind 
periods, allowing higher levels of renewable penetration. 
59.  An alternative would be to leapfrog diesel upgrading and move directly to greater 
renewables combined with storage – but this would require a considerable up-
front  investment  in  storage  as  well  as  grid  infrastructure.  In  any  event,  any 
decision to invest in new diesel needs to be made in the context of, and balanced 
against, reducing battery costs in relation to renewable energy storage as a source 
of baseload. 
60.  There  remain  significant  uncertainties  over  levels  of  fuel  imports  used  for 
electricity generation. Policies should be put in place to improve data collection – 
including more granularity on how imported fuel is used once on island – as well 
as to improve access to such data (much of which lies in the hands of commercial 
organizations) by the RMI Government and relevant agencies. 
61.  A major constraint to solar penetration aside from electricity grid limitations is the 
lack of land area in RMI. There is about 7 megawatts (MW) worth of existing 
usable  space  on  land  and  roofs.  Majuro  would  need  nearly  40  MW  of  solar 
capacity installed (with storage) to decarbonize its electricity grid based on current 
demand. Many buildings in Majuro lack the structural capacity to support rooftop 
solar. A lack of policy in this area poses a very real barrier to the roll out of 
renewable energy in the urbanized areas of RMI. As such, there is a need to 
urgently develop policy, such as: 
  the use of novel approaches to install solar (e.g. schools, basketball 
courts, hospitals, airport, etc.); 
  the potential use of floating solar panels for the reservoir by the airport 
or options for using floating solar in the lagoon, including addressing 
related land rights issues. Such options could be cheaper than land 
mounted solar; and 
Page 2 3  
  a  consistent  and  comprehensive  approach  for  negotiating  relevant 
access contracts for placement of solar panels. 
62.  Ebeye – the second largest grid in RMI – could follow a similar path to electricity 
sector  decarbonization  as  Majuro.  According  to  the  International  Renewable 
Energy Agency’s (IRENA) 2015 Renewables Readiness Assessment, Ebeye’s grid 
losses are considerably smaller than Majuro’s due to its size and the density of its  
population. Grid upgrades may still be necessary to allow for increased solar 
penetration.  
63.  For electricity storage, which is essential as renewable energy penetration for 
electricity generation increases, a mixture of stationary batteries, thermal storage, 
and  electric  vehicles  (which  can  provide  vehicle  to  grid  storage),  has  been 
assumed in the Scenarios set out in this 2050 Strategy. 
64.  Electric vehicles could play a role in electricity storage in the two main population 
centers  of  Majuro  and  Ebeye.  Vehicle  to  grid  storage  would  allow  RMI  to 
simultaneously  reduce  transportation  emissions  and  help  stabilize  the  grid  in 
response to the growing variability in electricity production introduced by the 
rising penetration of renewable energy. This may require infrastructure upgrades 
to facilitate bi-directional electricity flows to and from the grid. As a first step, a 
feasibility study should be conducted.  
65.  The remaining major population centers (Jaluit, Wotje, and Kili) operate micro-
grids powered by diesel. Demand in these micro-grids would not justify short-term 
investments  in  high-speed  diesel  engine  upgrades.  These  micro-grids  may 
therefore need to wait until they can be upgraded directly to a grid-connected 
solar system with energy storage. Off-grid solar can perhaps be pursued in the 
intervening period. In the outer atolls, the electricity sector is theoretically already 
decarbonized through off-grid stand-alone solar systems. However, the expansion 
of these systems and their long-term maintenance ought to be given  further 
consideration.  
66.  In all of the Scenarios considered, solar photovoltaics have been found to be the 
most viable renewable resource for RMI to achieve full decarbonization. While 
wind may also be a viable resource, it is still in its nascent stages in RMI. The lack 
of available land in RMI suggests that wind may need to play a significant role in 
the country’s future renewable energy mix. Feasibility studies in this area should 
be undertaken. 
67.  Whilst data collection and availability for the electricity sector is relatively well 
developed  compared  to  other  sectors,  there  still  seem  to  be  significant 
uncertainties. This is an area where improvement would assist in more accurate 
policy development and projections. Studies have, for example, tended to focus 
mainly on Majuro. 
68.  Ocean  Thermal Energy Conversion  (OTEC) has been  previously proposed  as  a 
moonshot technology that could significantly contribute to RMI’s decarbonization 
efforts and also make it an energy exporter. Feasibility studies for a proposed pilot 
project on Kwajalein have shown promise but two factors impede progress: lack of 
adequate demand; and absence of adequate financial capital. A power purchase 
Page 2 4  
agreement (PPA) with the US Army to supply electricity to the military base on 
Kwajalein would be necessary to address concerns around adequate demand as 
RMI alone would not justify the investment in an OTEC plant. Furthermore, raising 
financial capital is difficult as RMI is credit-constrained and would have to rely on 
private capital and grants to fund a pilot project. This can perhaps be overcome by 
stressing the economic co-benefits of OTEC as excess electricity can be used to 
produce hydrogen fuel, which can be employed domestically and sold on the 
international market. Additionally, OTEC can also be a freshwater resource and 
provide drought resilience for RMI.   
69.  As RMI looks towards full electricity decarbonization, the relationship between the 
Government and electric utilities will need to be reviewed to ensure that effective 
and efficient structures are in place to drive and oversee the transition to 100% 
renewable energy. For example, while the governance structure of the MEC and 
Kwajalein  Atoll  Joint  Utility  Resources  (KAJUR)  allow  for  limited  Government 
influence,  the  extent  of  this  influence  is  ambiguous  –  in  particular  from  the 
external perspective of donors and development banks – and could usefully be 
clarified.  
70.  Another important governance question is the role of the Energy Planning Division 
(EPD) within the Ministry of Resources and Development (R&D). While EPD is 
meant to be the “focal point for all energy-related activities and initiatives” it 
currently  lacks  the  regulatory  authority  necessary  to  drive  a  comprehensive 
decarbonization policy. An Energy Sector Management Act has been proposed “to 
clarify powers and responsibilities within Government for energy” but has yet to 
be drafted and passed by the Nitijela. Addressing this should be a priority.

Key Assumptions 
Electricity — Renewables 
71.  Assumption: the renewable potential in RMI involves a significant role for biomass 
(coconut oil), wind, and solar photovoltaics. 
72.  Assumption:  50%  of  the  current  coconut  oil  crop  can  be  used  to  generate 
electricity while the remaining 50% would be sold on the open market, either 
domestically or for export. Coconut oil would first be used for stationary energy 
rather than transportation or heating applications. As such, it could eventually 
replace approximately 12% of diesel used to generate electricity. 
73.  Wind power could make up several MW of RMI’s renewable generation, thanks to 
the improvement of technology and the availability of RMI’s atolls as pre-built 
offshore  wind  platforms.  Current  wind  data  appears  indeed  to  be  above 
economical thresholds in the US Midwest.  Assumption: one to two 1.5-2.5 MW 
turbines can be used in Majuro, as wind's generation profile is complementary to 
solar. 
74.  Land is scarce in RMI, and non-government rooftops are not structurally capable 
of supporting PV arrays. Assumption: RMI will use floating photovoltaics arrays 
when it runs out of appropriate rooftop space. 
 
Electricity — Storage 
75.  At higher renewable levels, some form of energy storage is necessary.  Assumption 
in  the  Moderate  Scenario:  no  storage  is  developed,  and  renewable  energy 
generation is therefore capped. Assumption in the Lighthouse Scenario: storage 
comes from a combination of thermal storage technologies and grid-to-electric 
vehicle storage.

76.  Assumption: Majuro electricity loss improvement efforts will reduce losses from 
30% to 20% in 2025. 
77.  Assumption: 25% (Moderate) and 50% (Lighthouse) end use energy efficiency 
improvements  by  2050.  This  will  come  from  a  combination  of  insulation 
improvements (retrofits, building codes), electrical grid loss reductions (from 30% 
losses to 20% by 2025), air conditioning improvements (seawater heat pumps and 
water-cooling towers appear to be able to achieve a 50% efficiency improvement), 
and other higher efficiency appliances (water pumps, motors, etc.).

2c – The Waste Sector 
 
Headline Recommendations 
 
  Focus – in the medium term out to 2030 – on policies and plans to reduce 
RMI’s  significant  and  growing  waste  problem  on  the  social  and  wider 
environmental  benefits  of  taking  action  rather  than  reduction  of  GHG 
emissions; 
  Develop policies and measures to minimize the level of organic material in 
collected waste – including a focus on local composting; 
  Analyze further the feasibility of generating energy from waste and the 
corresponding GHG benefits; 
  Assess future plans for the landfilling of waste carefully against RMI’s long-
term goals of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and for environmental 
impacts.  Apart  from  using  waste  for  land  reclamation,  landfill  is  not 
recommended as a primary policy to deal with waste; 
  Review the powers of the RMI Government to ensure they are fit for the 
purpose of developing and implementing relevant policies and measures. 
The 2008 draft waste strategy should be finalized, taking into account the 
latest data and this 2050 Strategy; and 
  Extend waste collection throughout the whole of Majuro to minimize the 
use of illegal waste dumps. 
 
 
Summary  
81.  Waste accounts for nearly a quarter of RMIs total GHG emissions, and if the 
country is to move towards net zero GHG emissions, this sector will need to be 
addressed. However, the waste sector is by far the most difficult of RMI’s sectors 
to decarbonize.  
82.  As such, and given that most of RMI’s GHG emissions reductions potential for its 
2025 and 2030 NDC targets will be delivered through the energy sector,  the 
country should not look to the waste sector as a significant contributor to reduce 
GHG emissions in the short to medium term. Rather, planning out to 2030 should 
focus on social benefits and the wider environmental advantages of dealing with 
the RMI’s significant and growing waste problem. 
83.  Having  said  that,  dealing  with  waste  and  reducing  GHG  emissions  in  an 
economically feasible way are not mutually exclusive. Planning for this sector 
should therefore align and be consistent with RMI’s 2050 goal. 
Page 3 0  
84.  A successful feasibility study for a 1.2 MW waste-to-energy (WTE) plant in Majuro 
was  conducted  in  2010.  WTE  would  substantially  reduce  RMI’s  waste-related 
emissions thanks to the reduction of methane emissions. Furthermore, a WTE 
plant could provide baseload power for RMI, at least partially eliminating the short 
to  medium-term  need  for  diesel-powered  electricity  generation.  This  would 
provide the dual benefit of reducing waste as well as decreasing the need for 
imported fossil fuel.  
85.  There are, however, operational concerns that are barriers to adopting WTE in 
RMI such as the lack of a reliable waste stream to run a WTE facility. One option 
might be for RMI to consider in further detail the potential to import waste from 
other  atolls.  In  particular,  waste  from  Ebeye  (combined  with  Majuro)  could 
perhaps provide a steady waste stream. In any event, further feasibility analysis of 
WTE potential should be carried out. 
86.  The Majuro Atoll Waste Company (MAWC) is looking into building an incineration 
facility  to  address  space  constraints  in  Majuro.  This  could  have  some  GHG 
reduction  potential  but,  as  with  WTE,  localized  air  pollution  risks  could  be  a 
concern.  
87.  Landfilling waste in RMI could, if planned and managed well, deliver co-benefits 
such as creating new land or as part of coastal defenses. However, landfilling of 
organic waste will very likely be inconsistent with RMI’s goal of net zero emissions 
by 2050 because recovery of GHG emissions from landfill is technically difficult and 
resource intensive, generally requiring significant amounts of freshwater and soil. 
88.  As such, very careful thought needs to be given as to whether or not to invest in 
landfill. Given the general unsuitability of RMI for landfill, a WTE approach might 
be more preferable and more consistent with the overall vision of moving towards 
net zero emissions by 2050. If landfilling is pursued, methods such as a "Fukuoka" 
style landfill, which reduces methane emissions by 50% compared to standard 
landfills, should be considered. 
89.  To date, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has sought to reduce solid 
and toxic waste that pose direct threats to human health. Going forward, given 
that waste management in the outer atolls would be difficult to oversee, RMI 
should focus its efforts on reducing organic waste – the major driver of waste-
related GHG emissions – in its major population centers, specifically in Majuro and 
Ebeye. Urgent priority needs to be given to local composting of organic material 
and  separating  out  organic  materials  from  the  general  waste  stream.  Local 
initiatives such as composting will be key to this. 
90.  Waste collection should be urgently extended throughout Majuro. This should 
assist in minimizing the use of illegal waste dumps, burning, burying or dumping of 
waste into the ocean – including of toxic wastes. 
91.  Government authority over waste management is relatively decentralized in RMI, 
which complicates national efforts to reduce waste-related emissions as there is 
no clear responsibility for national policy. The ad hoc reliance on the EPA for this 
purpose – which is an enforcement agency – is far from ideal. Government powers 
should be reviewed for adequacy to ensure they are fit for purpose. As part of 
Page 3 1  
that, the 2008 draft waste strategy should be finalized, taking into account the 
latest data and this 2050 Strategy. 
92.  A fundamental problem is that the vast majority (up to 90%) of what is imported 
to RMI stays here. Consideration should be given to introducing policies to: 
  influence the nature and types of material that are imported, with the 
aim of reducing waste – for example by discouraging importation of 
packaging materials that cannot be economically recycled or are not 
biodegradable (e.g. banning or reducing the import of plastic bottles or 
plastic bags); 
  incentivize recycling (e.g. through deposit schemes); 
  improve  waste  reduction  across  all  atolls  through  public  education 
programs and existing Government mandates. 
93.  Many waste studies have been conducted in RMI, which have generated a wealth 
of data. It is recommended that these are consolidated. An overarching study 
could be launched, and a comprehensive policy consequently developed based on 
the study’s conclusions. As part of this, RMI should complete the development of 
its national waste strategy, initiated in 2008 in conjunction with the South Pacific 
Regional Environment Program (SPREP).

Key Assumptions 
94.  Assumption in both Moderate and Lighthouse Scenarios: the Majuro landfill is 
over capacity and therefore should be closed and replaced with a "Fukuoka" style 
landfill, which reduces methane emissions by 50% compared to standard landfills. 
95.  WTE incineration can reduce landfill volumes/land requirements but has higher 
eventual emissions. Assumption: incineration in the Moderate Scenario, but not 
for the Lighthouse Scenario. 
96.  Assumption: RMI can achieve higher recycling levels by 2050, reaching current US 
levels by 2025 and current EU levels by 2040 in all Scenarios.

2d – Domestic Transportation – Land based 
 
Headline Recommendations 
 
  Develop polices to encourage a greater use of public transport, as well as 
cycling and walking, and to reduce the reliance and demand on private 
vehicles; 
  Commission  further  analysis  to  identify  policy  options  to  increase  the 
uptake of electric vehicles; 
  Consider policies to require  Government departments and agencies to 
transition to electric vehicles; and 
  Improve data collection, including on what proportion of imported fossil 
fuels are used by domestic land transport. 
 
 
Summary  
99.  The  decarbonization  pathway  for  land  transportation  would  require  the 
electrification of the transportation fleet with the possibility of also leveraging low 
and zero-carbon fuel sources such as biofuel and hydrogen.  
100.  These alternative fuel sources currently show little promise. Hydrogen-powered 
vehicles are only plausible if OTEC becomes viable and offers RMI a cheap stream 
of hydrogen fuel.  
101.  Most likely RMI will largely need to transition its land transportation fleet to 
electric vehicles. A three-year pilot project in Majuro funded by Japan is testing 
the viability of solar powered electric vehicles. The results of this pilot should be 
analyzed and disseminated. 
Page 3 4  
102.  Five main barriers would need to be addressed to increase the penetration of 
electric vehicles in RMI: 
  the absence of clear institutional authority to mandate/facilitate the 
uptake of electric vehicles; 
  the relative cost of electric vehicles; 
  the lack of charging infrastructure; 
  the current limits of electricity generation; 
  the prohibitive cost, especially to the public. 
103.  The  relationship  between  increased  use  of  electric  vehicles  and  increased 
electricity demand will need to be further explored. Policies in both areas will 
need to be consistent.  
104.  The major impediment to decarbonizing the land transportation sector is the 
absence of clear institutional authority that can mandate electric vehicle sales and 
make the necessary infrastructure upgrades (e.g. charging stations) to support 
electric  vehicles.  While  the  Government  could  leverage  existing  laws  (i.e.  the 
Import Duties Act) to encourage the purchase of fuel-efficient and/or electric 
vehicles, an implementing/planning agency would still be necessary but currently 
does not exist. In the intervening period, Government agencies should be the 
initial adopters of these vehicles.  
105.  In any event, RMI should commission further analysis of the potential to transition 
towards  electric  land-based  transport,  covering  challenges,  solutions  and 
opportunities as a basis for informed policy development. Hard and soft policy 
options could include: 
  tax incentives for the importation of electric vehicles; 
  transitioning the Government fleet to electric vehicles; 
  transitioning the taxi fleet to electric vehicles; 
  the use of golf carts – as is the case with the US military base on 
Kwajalein. 
106. In  future  RMI  could  consider  vehicle  to  grid  storage,  further  integrating 
decarbonization efforts of the transportation and electricity sectors.  
107. There is considerable uncertainty as to what proportion of RMI’s imported fossil 
fuels is used for domestic land transport. Better data will be needed to establish a 
baseline, develop informed policies and monitor progress towards net zero GHG 
emissions in this sector. 
108. As a first step, however, RMI should consider developing policies to encourage a 
greater use of public transport, as well as cycling and walking, and to reduce the 
reliance  and  demand  on  private  vehicles.  Increased  cycling  and  walking  in 
particular would have a number of co-benefits, including reduced pollution and 
improved public health. 
109. Hard and soft policy options to incentivize walking and cycling could include: 
Page 3 5  
  improved  urban  planning  –  such  as  clearly  demarcated  cycling  and 
walking paths with shade; 
  public and school education programs; 
  school cycle training programs; 
  cycle hire schemes; 
  cycle  to  work  schemes,  where  the  Government  and  private  sector 
workers could have the up-front cost of cycle purchase deferred; 
  encouraging Government workers to use Government cycles to travel 
between different departments. 
110. The  social  impacts,  including  gender  issues,  of  such  options  will  need  to  be 
carefully considered.

2e – Domestic Transportation – Ocean based 
 
Headline Recommendations 
 
  Improve data collection to better illustrate what proportion of imported 
fossil fuels are used by domestic sea-based transport; 
  Explore  options  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  from  domestic  ocean-based 
transport, including by using the results of the GIZ/University of the South 
Pacific (USP) Low Carbon Sea Transport Transition Project (LCSTTP); and 
  Consider institutional reforms that will allow the Ministry of Transport and 
Communication (MTC) to exercise more effective regulatory control over 
the operational aspects of domestic sea transport in addition to managing 
the infrastructure.  
 
 
Summary  
114.  Domestic  shipping  is  responsible  for  approximately  a  third  of  RMI’s  fuel 
consumption. RMI was the only country to explicitly include domestic shipping in 
its 2025 NDC and has led the way – as the world’s second biggest flag registry – to 
encourage  efforts  to  decarbonize  international  shipping  at  the  International 
Maritime Organization (IMO). 
115.  There are a number of interventions that RMI can pursue in the short to medium-
term to achieve a low-carbon pathway for domestic sea transportation. These 
include:  
  changes to ship design; 
  changes to operations; 
  fuel switching/mixing; 
  improved docking facilities to reduce the amount of time (and fuel) 
required to load and unload ships. 
116.  These  efficiency  improvements  can  also  provide  economic  benefits  through 
avoided costs from fuel imports.  
117.  A  pathway  to  full decarbonization for  sea  transport,  however,  appears  to  be 
unfeasible  in  the  medium  term.  RMI  should  carefully  monitor  and  reap  the 
benefits of the GIZ’s/USP’s LCSTTP under the Micronesian Center for Sustainable 
Transport established in Majuro.  
Page 3 8  
118.  There is considerable uncertainty as to what proportion of RMI’s imported fossil 
fuels are used for domestic sea transport. Better data will be needed in order to 
establish a baseline, develop informed policies and monitor progress towards net 
zero GHG emissions in this sector. The initial baseline studies by the LCSTTP could 
prove very useful in this regard. 
119.  Considering RMI’s status as the second largest flag registry in the world, successful 
adoption of nascent low- or zero-carbon sea transport technologies at home could 
have ripple effects across the international shipping sector at large.   
120.  The  MTC  has  administrative  control  over  seaports  but  apparently  lacks  the 
authority to mandate conservation and efficiency improvements in sea transport. 
To more aggressively pursue a decarbonization strategy in sea transportation, RMI 
should consider institutional reforms that will allow the MTC to exercise more 
effective regulatory control over the operational aspects of domestic sea transport 
in addition to managing the infrastructure.

2f – Cooking & Lighting 
 
Headline Recommendations 
 
  Continue efforts to phase out the use of kerosene for lighting and cooking; 
  Engage women stakeholders as key players in this sector and empower 
women as entrepreneurs with capacity building and technology transfer; 
and 
  Establish whether the Energy Planning Division (EPD) needs a more robust 
Government mandate in order to fully decarbonize these activities. 
 
 
Page 4 0  
Summary  
123.  Kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) used for cooking and lighting are 
significant contributors towards the ‘other’ sector listed in RMI’s GHG emissions 
inventory. In 2010, the base year used for RMI’s NDC, the ‘other’ sector accounted 
for nearly the same level of emissions as the transportation sector, underscoring 
its significance when considering RMI’s decarbonization pathway.  
124.  As a result of the electrification of RMI’s population centers, kerosene use for 
lighting has significantly declined. Similarly, the adoption of solar lighting in the 
outer atolls has also led to a decrease in kerosene use. RMI must continue these 
efforts to phase out the use of kerosene for lighting.  
125.  For cooking, due to public health concerns, particularly for women and children, 
RMI has already embarked on an aggressive low-carbon strategy encouraging the 
replacement of kerosene with LPG and efficient biomass cook-stoves (e.g. the 
‘One Smokeless Stove Per Home’ project). However, the decarbonization pathway 
is less clear since electric/solar-powered stoves are not seen as viable at the 
moment.  
126.  RMI  has  made  remarkable  progress  thus  far  with  its  existing  institutional 
arrangements to reduce GHG emissions from cooking and lighting. The MEC, with 
a  Government  mandate,  has  moved forward with  full  electrification of  urban

electrification target for rural households in the outer atolls.  
127.  The  EPD  has  played  a  critical  role  in  procuring  and  funneling  development 
assistance to encourage the use of more efficient and environmentally friendly 
fuels for cooking. The lifestyle and economic benefits of eschewing kerosene have 
been natural drivers for a low-carbon pathway for cooking and lighting.  
128.  A more robust Government mandate to phase out GHG emissions from this sector 
may be needed to provide EPD with the mandate to undertake the final step 
towards decarbonization.

the Lighthouse Scenario electric cooking will be used to phase out LPG by 2050 as 
electricity  prices  become  set  by  low  solar  array  prices.  This  is  valid  for  the

Section 3 – Adaptation & Climate Resilience 
 
Headline Recommendations 
 
  Review and consolidate policies and measures on adaptation and climate 
resilience, as well as social and economic policies, to align with strategic 
principals and priorities, an understanding of recent and future impacts of 
climate change and a phased and adaptive approach to action; 
  Initiate, as soon as possible, the process to develop a National Adaptation 
Plan (NAP) by the end of 2019. The NAP should: 
  incorporate  adaptation  and  climate  resilience  milestones  to  be 
achieved, for example by 2020, 2025, 2030 and 2050, as well as 
suggest measures to achieve them; 
  elaborate  immediate,  accelerated  gender-responsive  actions  and 
investments  over  the  next  5  years  (2019-2023)  to  adapt  to  the 
impacts of climate change and transition to climate resilience; 
  suggest, as appropriate, updates to relevant national policies and 
legislation; 
  set  out  a  plan  for  significant  investments  in  adaptation  and 
resilience  in  order  to  be  in  a  position  to  fully  implement  its 
recommendations;  
  incorporate, as appropriate, the key recommendations arising from 
the review of the JNAP;  
  Submit RMI’s Adaptation Communication to the UNFCCC by 2020 at the 
latest, setting out RMI’s intended adaptation contribution to achieving the 
goals of the Paris Agreement; 
  Reflect RMI’s intention to produce a NAP and Adaptation Communication 
in its forthcoming NDC; and  
  Establish,  as  soon  as  possible,  financing  pathways  for  adaptation, 
resilience  and  protection  measures,  particularly  focusing  on  coastal 
resilience including coastal vulnerability assessments, as well as tackling 
critical knowledge gaps in key areas. 
 
 
Summary  
132.  RMI’s  international  climate  change  focus  has  been  largely  on  mitigation  and 
related  issues.  Even  if  the  Paris  Agreement  goal  of  limiting  global  average 
temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius is achieved, the serious impacts on a 
Page 4 3  
climate  vulnerable  nation,  such  as  RMI,  will  be  considerable.  Domestically, 
attention will urgently and increasingly need to focus on adaptation and climate 
change resilience. 
133.  RMI’s existing adaptation policies are built around three pillars: 
  having  a  clear  sense  of  strategic  principals  and  priorities  (e.g.  RMI’s 
inalienable right to exist and its exceptional status as an atoll nation); 
  an understanding of recent and future impacts of climate change, using 
climate patterns and evidence, and regional and global projections; and   
  a  phased  and  adaptive  approach  to  action  –  focused  on  protection, 
elevation and consolidation as well as on the identification of knowledge 
gaps and capacity needs, and on the importance of innovative financing.  
134.  Understandably, much of RMI’s adaptation efforts have focused on policies and 
measures  to  combat  drought,  which  has  already  had  a  significant  impact  on 
communities.  But  focus  over  the  coming  years  will  also  need  to  look  more 
systematically at other aspects of adaptation, including the climate resilience of 
women, men and youth.   
135.  Particular  immediate  areas  of  focus  for  adaption  are  likely  to  be,  but  not 
necessarily limited to, coastal resilience including coastal vulnerability assessment. 
136.  RMI should set out a vision for adaptation and climate resilience, incorporating 
milestones to be achieved, for example by 2020, 2025, 2030 and 2050 – as well as 
suggested  measures  to  achieve  them.  Prioritization  will  be  critical  to  attract 
necessary private, public and international funding to implement policies, and in a 
way that is consistent with RMI’s strategic interests. 
137.  Particular areas of focus for resilience could include, but not be limited to: 
  disaster risk management – including working through the Chief Secretary’s 
Office to build further capacity nationally; and improving communications 
with outer islands; 
  contingency and emergency response – including putting in place a financial 
mechanism  to  allow  rapid  response  and  emergency  funding,  such  as 
frameworks, protocols and procedures for rapid disbursement. 
138.  Thought  will  need to be  given  as  to  how progress  against  specific  goals  and 
milestones should be measured and tracked. Adaptation and climate resilience 
policies should be reviewed to identify overlaps and redundancies, with a view to 
consolidation. This review should also identify and clearly allocate responsibilities 
for taking forward specific policies. 
139.  A big barrier to implementing adaptation and resilience measures is long-term 
financing. Because private sector finance is particularly hard to secure in this area, 
public sector funding from the international donor/development sector must be a 
focus. In that context, capacity and resource constraints to RMI accessing some of 
major international climate finance and climate-related ODA is an issue that needs 
to be urgently addressed.  
Page 4 4  
140.  The  cost  and  consequences  of  underestimating  future  changes,  in  particular 
future rates of sea level rise, and thus underinvesting in appropriate adaptation 
and building resilience would be catastrophic. Socioeconomic costs will also need 
to be evaluated, as well as the impacts of the identified responses to build 
adaptive capacity and resilience keeping in mind the women, men and youth of 
the most vulnerable communities. Therefore, RMI must apply the precautionary 
principle in future planning and implementation.  
141.  While RMI is already taking measures to adapt and to build resilience, including 
through a number of projects underway, including the Pacific Resilience Program 
Phase  2  (PREP  II),  the Addressing  Climate Vulnerability in the  Water  Sector 
project (ACWA), and others, it is now a matter of urgency to develop a NAP – 
and to aim to complete it by the end of 2019 at the latest.  
142.  RMI should follow up production of its NAP with a subsequent Adaptation 
Communication to the UNFCCC, in which it sets out its contribution towards 
meeting the adaptation goal set out in the Paris Agreement (Article 2(1)(b)). The 
Adaption Communication, and the goals it contains, should be based on the key 
recommendations  of  the  NAP,  preferably  be  quantifiable,  and  articulate  the 
means  of  implementation  needed  to  achieve  those  goals.  The  Adaptation 
Communication could be a stand-alone document or submitted as part of a 
subsequent National Communication. Building on the NAP, its production and 
submission need not be resource intensive. 
143.  The commitment to produce a NAP and Adaptation Communication should be 
set out in RMI’s forthcoming NDC. 
144.  The NAP should, as appropriate, align with and build on existing national and 
regional policies and plans, particularly the recommendations of the recently 
completed review of RMI’s JNAP (2018) and set out what RMI considers to be the 
most  plausible  scenarios  for  the  key  manifestations  of  climate  change,  in 
particular  sea  level  rise,  bearing  in  mind  the  need  –  consistent  with  the 
precautionary principle – to consider extreme-case scenarios. 
145.  While  the  NAP  will  need  to  articulate  detailed  priorities  and  actions  for 
adaptation and building resilience, it is already clear that  RMI’s pathway to 
adaptation will need to consider at least the following four areas:  
  Protection:  including  coastal  protection,  infrastructure  climate-proofing, 
community and household resilience building, food security, water security, 
health  security,  and  broader  adaptation  and  disaster  risk  reduction 
investments, including the development of financial mechanisms to finance 
investments and response and recovery efforts; 
  Elevation: all new construction of all types of structures should be elevated, 
based on the new National Building Code to be finalized in 2019 and other 
policies to be adopted. As conditions are likely to worsen, particularly sea 
level rise, new policies and plans for constructing elevated settlements for 
future consolidation of the population will be critical; 
  Consolidation:  in  the  event  that  the  majority  of  communities  become 
increasingly vulnerable and experience more frequent and dire effects of 
Page 4 5  
climate change, including flooding and inundation, there may need to be a 
policy to consolidate the population onto elevated settlements. It is plausible 
that a policy for consolidation may need to be considered sooner rather than 
later; and 
  Relocation: while relocation should be considered the last-resort option, it is 
likely that some Marshallese will choose to migrate, as many have done so 
already.  Moreover,  it  is  possible  that  RMI  may  not  be  able  to  viably 
accommodate the entire 60,000-plus residents that are projected to be living 
in  the  country  by  2030.  Therefore,  the  Government  will  need  to 
simultaneously assure the right of citizens to remain in the islands as best it 
can,  and  ensure  continued  opportunity  for  migration  for  those  who  so 
choose to relocate.  
146.  Given the dynamic nature of climate change and disaster risks, the NAP and 
Adaptation Communication should be reviewed and, if necessary, revised every 
five years as a minimum, aligning with the five-year cycles of future updates of this 
RMI 2050 Strategy.  
147.  An  immediate  priority  is  securing  financing  for  protection  measures  and  to 
urgently address knowledge gaps in order to ensure a solid foundation for the 
milestones and measures to be set out in the NAP, including in the four areas set 
out above.  
148.  More specifically there is an urgent need to expand coastal protection measures 
and investments, complete and implement the new building code, strengthen 
food and water security, and develop more formal financing mechanisms for both 
disaster risk reduction and post-disaster response and recovery. RMI must work 
effectively with existing and new development partners to secure initial resources 
for these priority investments. 
149.  In relation to tackling critical knowledge gaps, some immediate critical questions 
that need to be addressed include: 
  How will global sea level rise translate into regional and RMI-specific sea level 
rise in the future?  
  What changes in precipitation, air temperature, ocean acidification, tropical 
cyclones, and coastal vulnerability and hazards will RMI likely experience in 
the coming decades? 
  What will be the economic, social, community, and health impacts of the 
increasingly  adverse  effects  of  climate  change,  including  on  the  most 
vulnerable? 
  What resources, including sand and aggregate, are available  – and what 
amounts are sustainable – for coastal protection and other adaptation and 
disaster risk reduction infrastructure projects?  
  How will sea level rise impact RMI’s claim to its sovereign territory, exclusive 
economic zone, and the resources within its current boundaries?  
Page 4 6  
  How  will  marine  resources  such  as  pelagic  (including  tuna)  and  inshore 
species be affected by future climate change?  
  Can RMI construct elevated settlements to house its future population or a 
part thereof? How could such settlements be developed and settled?  
  If Marshallese relocate to other countries, what are the most appropriate 
places and means of resettlement? What rights and status would they have? 
  Should establishing resettlement communities be considered as an option to 
preserve the Marshallese language and culture? 
150.  RMI’s  future  adaptation  and  resilience  policies,  including  the  NAP,  should  be 
underpinned by the following principles: 
  our  natural  right  to  live  on  our  islands  –  the  Marshallese  people  have 
occupied  this  archipelago  for  some  3,000  years  and  have  a  natural  and 
inalienable right to continue living and thriving in these islands. It is the RMI 
Government’s official policy to assure this right to the women, men, youth 
and  future  generations  of  Marshallese,  as  well  as  to  assure  continued 
opportunity to migrate for those who choose this as their ultimate means of 
adaptation, to the best of its ability; 
  prioritize support and capacity building for the most vulnerable and those 
least capable of adapting – RMI’s social protection system, which remains in 
an underdeveloped stage, will need to be strengthened to better deliver 
targeted social assistance and household and community support for women, 
men and youth;  
  a  fundamental  focus  on  resilience  –  building  resilience  to  the  effects  of 
climate change as well as managing and mitigating disasters from natural 
hazard risks are strategic priorities for RMI;  
  follow  best-practice  –  RMI  will  follow  a  best-practice  adaptation  and 
resilience  approach,  taking  into  account  the  latest  scientific  evidence, 
building on relevant lessons from other countries and regions, and working 
with development partners. A knowledge-first evidence-based approach will 
be critical, as will be  taking into account indigenous knowledge and the 
knowledge of rural communities; 
  innovative financing, environmental, and engineering solutions; and 
  the  exceptional  circumstances  of  atoll  nations  like  RMI  –  while  climate 
change will surely impact all SIDS,  the unique circumstances and unique 
vulnerability of atoll nations should be further recognized. 
 
 
Potential Measures and Next Steps 
151.  Immediate priority next steps are to: 
Page 4 7  
  take stock of and implement, as appropriate, the recommendations of the 
JNAP review; and 
  initiate the production of RMI’s NAP, including securing external means of 
implementation to do so. 
 
 
Local and Global Trends that will be Relevant to RMI’s Future Adaptation 
and Resilience Planning 
152.  The  effects  of  climate  change  are  manifest  in  changes  in  air  and  sea 
temperatures,  rainfall  patterns,  ocean  acidification,  typhoons,  and  other 
observable  phenomena.  Figure  16  below  summarizes  the  recent  trends  and 
future projections for these changes from the most recent sources available.

153.  The most recent global mean sea level rise projections suggest a direr outlook. As 
reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA 2017), 
there has been continued and growing evidence that Antarctica and Greenland are 
losing mass at an accelerated rate; this growing evidence of accelerated ice loss 
only strengthens the argument for considering worst-case scenarios in coastal risk 
management. 
154.  Importantly,  sea  levels  have  not  risen  uniformly  across  the  globe,  and  the 
anticipated level of sea level rise in the Western Pacific is between 20% to 40% 
above the global mean. This suggests that by 2030, in the best-case scenario RMI 
may experience 4.61 inches of sea level rise, and in the worst-case scenario over 1 
foot (12.28 inches) of sea level rise.

Section 4 – Means of Implementation 
 
Headline Recommendations 
 
  Identify  &  consider  options  for  a  more  coordinated  and  centralized 
approach to applying for, and monitoring, overseas aid and investment in 
relation to implementation of RMI’s NDC and 2050 Strategy; 
  Develop a long-term finance strategy to  implement RMI’s current and 
future NDC, future National Adaptation Plan as well as this 2050 Strategy. 
The long-term finance strategy should:  
  prioritize  and  target  funding  applications  in  a  strategic  and 
coordinated way; and 
  be  regularly  reviewed  and  monitored  to  deliver  against  key 
objectives. 
  Prioritize in-country capacity building and institutional strengthening in 
relation to every aspect of the implementation of this 2050 Strategy, and 
at  all  levels  of  stakeholders,  including  communities,  women,  men  and 
youth.  
 
 
Summary  
155.  Effective implementation of this 2050 Strategy will require coordinated efforts 
across all sectors, including governance, GHG emissions reductions, adaptation 
and resilience, finance, and monitoring, reporting and verification. The availability 
of means of implementation – including long-term finance and capacity building – 
will  be  major  factors  limiting  the  extent  to  which  this  2050  Strategy  can  be 
implemented. RMI should maximize inward investment and provision of means of 
implementation on climate change-related issues. Continued political leadership 
at the highest levels, along with a clear governance structure for implementation 
of all aspects of this 2050 Strategy, will also be necessary. 
156.  There  is  no  centralized  comprehensive  overview  of  the  donor 
assistance/development aid that RMI is eligible to apply for, has applied for or has 
secured, nor of monitoring of implementation once funds have been secured in 
areas of relevance to the implementation of RMI’S NDC or this 2050 Strategy. A 
major  cause  is  that  responsibilities  for  doing  so  are  fragmented  across 
Government departments and agencies. 
157.  In order to improve efficiencies, to provide an enhanced enabling environment for 
donors and so attract more inward investment, and to secure funds consistent 
with nationally driven priorities, options for a more coordinated and centralized 
approach to applying for, and monitoring, overseas aid and investment in relation 
Page 5 2  
to areas of relevance to RMI’s NDC and this 2050 Strategy should be identified and 
assessed. 
158.  The main functions to be considered are: 
  overall policy and priority setting – what funds to apply for, etc; 
  operational  –  such  as  oversight  and  quality  control  of  applications,  and 
ensuring alignment with high level Government policies, including this 2050 
Strategy; and 
  monitoring – collection of data, including on project delivery. 
159.  In 2017 the Cabinet agreed in principle that the Economic Policy, Planning and 
Strategy Office (EPSO) should do overarching monitoring, and that the Division of 
International  Development  Assistance  (DIDA)  should  centrally  coordinate  and 
manage overseas assistance, but a final decision has not yet been made. Any 
centralization of functions needs to be sensitively handled and not interfere with 
existing policy setting and substantive functions of existing Government ministries 
and departments, without careful consideration. In that context, consideration 
should be given to the Chief Secretary’s Office having a role in relation to overall 
policy setting and prioritization.  
160.  In order to more effectively attract investment in relation to RMI’s NDC, its future 
NAP and this 2050 Strategy a long-term climate finance strategy needs to be put 
in  place.  The  long-term  finance  strategy  should  prioritize  and  target  funding 
applications in a strategic and coordinated way. Consideration should also be 
given as to whether and how donor assistance could be pooled, so as to ensure 
efficiency and reduce administrative burdens on both donors and RMI. That long-
term finance strategy should also be regularly reviewed and monitored to deliver 
against key objectives. 
161.  Unless  more  effective  oversight  and  coordination  is  put  in  place,  including 
establishing a clear mechanism to enable and improve the efficiency of Overseas 
Development Assistance (ODA) coordination, RMI’s ability to attract necessary 
levels of future climate finance consistent with domestic priorities is likely to be 
significantly  constrained.  As  such  it  is  recommended  that  the  Government 
urgently considers how to deliver a more coordinated and centralized approach 
to applying for and monitoring overseas aid and investment. 
162. It  is  important  that  means  of  implementation build  on  and  strengthen  wider 
development policy across all sectors. Mitigation, adaptation, and climate change 
resilience actions identified in this 2050 Strategy should be further mainstreamed 
and integrated into existing development planning processes and national plans 
and strategies. Developing a new and separate process is not necessary. 
163. RMI’s  strategic  approach  to  long-term  finance  and  wider  means  of 
implementation  should  be  dynamic,  and  be  periodically  reviewed,  assessed 
against  delivery  of  objectives  and  updated  to  reflect  and  ensure  relevancy, 
validity, transparency, and accuracy. 
164.  At the same time, means of implementation for short term action in line with the 
priorities  of  this  2050  Strategy  is  also  critical.  Implementation  of  RMI’s  NDC 
Page 5 3  
Partnership Plan, which identifies the immediate priorities for action and existing 
gaps, and coordinates support from partners to achieve these priorities, will be 
very important. This can and should be leveraged over time to enhance donor 
support toward implementation of future NDCs and this 2050 Strategy.  
165.  In general, capacity and resource constraints are a significant factor restricting 
RMI’s ability to access international climate-related assistance. This is an issue that 
needs to be urgently addressed and in-country capacity building and institutional 
strengthening should be prioritized in relation to all aspects of implementation of 
this 2050 Strategy.

166. The  Government  should  utilize  a  robust  process  in  implementing  this  2050 
Strategy including an initial assessment of resource needs and clear sequencing of 
activities in accordance with identified priorities. 
167. In that context a long-term climate finance strategy and strategy on wider means 
of implementation should clearly set out actions, timings, and responsibilities.

Section 5 – Transparency, Environmental & Social 
Information 
 
Headline Recommendations 
 
  Review roles and responsibilities for data measurement, reporting and 
verification (MRV), and develop policies to ensure that the current system 
is more effective; 
  Improve capacity in the area of environmental information and social data 
collection, monitoring, reporting and verification as a priority, including 
through  accessing  available  assistance  such  as  the  UNFCCC  Capacity 
Building Initiative on Transparency (CBIT); 
  Prioritize producing and submitting a Biennial Update Report and a Third 
National Communication; and 
  Transition to using the latest IPCC Guidelines – including in the production 
of the next NDC. 
 
 
Summary  
168.  Good  quality  data  and  monitoring  systems  are  crucial  for  informed  policy 
development and to measure progress towards achieving goals. 
169.  The lack of reliable up-to-date quality environmental data is a significant issue in 
relation to every aspect of RMI’s NDC and this 2050 Strategy. Unless addressed, 
this will be a significant barrier to RMI achieving its climate change objectives as 
set out in its NDC and this 2050 Strategy.  
170.  The main problems are: 
  institutional  –  fragmented,  overlapping  and  unclearly  allocated 
responsibilities for data collection and monitoring; 
  ineffective data coordination and sharing between Government agencies; 
  lack of resources and capacity. 
171.  RMI should review roles and responsibilities and should put in place policies to 
address these problems and to implement a more effective system. International 
means of implementation available to make improvements in this area should be 
accessed as a priority. 
172.  It should be noted that some of the analysis and recommendations in this 2050 
Strategy are based on RMI’s 2010 inventory as set out in its Second National 
Communication. That inventory should be officially updated and set out in RMI’s 
Page 5 5  
future Third National Communication. Once that is done, the recommendations in 
this 2050 Strategy may need to be updated in future revisions.

Section 6 – Gender & Human Rights  
 
Headline Recommendations 
 
  Mainstream and safeguard gender and human rights, including in relation 
to  developing,  adopting,  reviewing  and  implementing  laws,  policies  and 
projects related to climate change;   
  Commission further analysis with a view to  implementing a strategy to 
improve  disaggregated  data  collection,  monitoring,  evaluation  and 
accountability;  
  Utilize  participatory  community  led,  bottom-up  approaches  to  identify 
challenges and best practices with stakeholders and beneficiaries; 
  Commission specific research on impacts of climate change on men and 
women, and their associated responses, in all their diversities drawing on 
traditional knowledge and skills; 
  Secure  technical  assistance  and  resources  to  strengthen  capacity across 
national and local Governments, as well as civil society and NGO networks, 
to  design  and  deliver  gender-responsive  climate  change  programs  and 
services; 
  Ensure  programs  and  projects  contribute  to  secure  family  wellbeing 
including  healthy  lives  and  livelihoods,  through  education,  domestic 
partnerships, family and household responsibilities, sexual and reproductive 
health; 
  Eliminate  gender-based  violence  and  increase  protection  and  care  of 
survivors; 
  Establish an enabling environment for an equitable participation in, and 
benefits from, economic development; 
  Ensure  equitable  participation  of  women  and  men  in  decision-making 
through  equal  opportunities  for  women  and  men  in  all  fields  of 
employment,  inclusive  decision-making  and  support  women’s 
entrepreneurship; 
  Design and implement a program for progressive compliance with human 
rights obligations; and 
  Build the knowledge and capacity of women, men and youth to address 
gender inequalities across sectors. 
 
 
   
Page 5 7  
Summary 
173.  Climate change will affect everyone, but the impacts of climate change, and the 
response initiatives, will be differentiated among women, men and youth. Women 
and children, disabled and impoverished groups are often the most vulnerable and 
disproportionately  affected  by  the  impacts  of  climate  change  due  to  their 
marginalization  in  global  society,  limiting  their  access,  use  and  control  over 
resources and services. This limits their responses, including adaptive capacity and 
resilience to climate change. 
174.  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has put 
in place multiple mandates to support gender responsive and human rights-based 
approaches to ensure that climate change policy, programing and implementation 
address the interests, needs and capacities of women and men for efficient and 
effective  outcomes.  The  recently  adopted  UNFCCC  Gender  Action  Plan  (GAP) 
states: 
‘Gender-responsive climate policy requires further strengthening in all activities 
concerning adaptation, mitigation and related means of implementation (finance, 
technology development and transfer, and capacity-building) as well as decision-
making on the implementation of climate policies. The GAP recognizes the need for 
women to be represented in all aspects of the UNFCCC process and the need for 
gender mainstreaming through all relevant targets and goals in activities under 
the Convention as an important contribution to increasing their effectiveness’.2 
175.  Additionally, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) link gender equality (Goal 
5) and climate change (Goal 13). SDG Target 13b suggests countries should: 
‘Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change related 
planning  and  management  in  least  developed  countries  and  small  island 
developing States, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized 
communities’3. 
176.  Natural disasters, climate change hazards, food insecurity, water crises and public 
health risks are all threats facing the women, men and youth of RMI. Climate risks 
are particularly serious, in part because sources of cash income are limited, leaving 
people with little in the way of savings or financial resources to adapt to changing 
conditions or recover from climate change-related stresses.  
177.  In 2016, studies revealed that the changing climate and environmental conditions 
associated with drought resulted in higher morbidity rates and declining nutrition 
levels, negatively affecting human development and quality of life. Drought also 
compromises food security with related malnutrition, notably in the outer islands. 
Natural disasters have resulted in an unknown number of internally displaced 
people, who have been forced to leave their homes and islands because of factors, 
including drought, exacerbated by climate change.  
178.  Women are more vulnerable than men to the effects of events related to climate 
change, but their critical role in recovery and resilience is gaining recognition. The 
                                                 
2 https://unfccc.int/topics/gender/workstreams/gender-action-plan  
3 https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg13  
Page 5 8  
2015‒2016  drought  reduced  women’s  incomes  from  handcrafts  because  it 
decreased the supply of necessary materials (pandanus, coconut, vines, etc.) and, 
across RMI, increased the time and effort needed – and in some cases the cost – 
to secure water and to perform other household tasks for their families.  
179.  While women and different social groups have been disproportionally affected by 
the  2015–2016  drought,  women’s  contribution  to  the  household  economy  is 
substantial. Therefore, women will be a critical partner in recovery and resilience. 
Post-disaster recovery resources must therefore strive to safeguard, restore and 
promote the economic engagement and participation of disadvantaged groups. 
Recovery  efforts  must  redress  gender  inequalities  or,  at  the  very  least,  not 
perpetuate unequal access to power and resources. 
180.  In early 2015, the RMI Government adopted its National Gender Mainstreaming 
Policy.  The  Policy  guides  the  development  of  laws,  policies,  procedures  and 
practices to address the needs, priorities and aspirations of all women and men 
and to eliminate all forms of discrimination and inequality. The priority areas of 
the policy are: strengthening capacity across Government to integrate gender 
equality  into  Government  services  and  programs;  family  well-being  and 
eliminating gender-based violence and protecting and caring for survivors; and 
improving  women’s  economic  empowerment  and  participation  in  decision-
making. The policy also identifies vulnerable groups of women including those 
living in the outer islands (rural areas) and those with disabilities. 
181.  Going  forward,  key  recommendations  arising  from  the  GAP  should  be 
incorporated, as appropriate, into existing and future RMI policies to implement 
this 2050 Strategy. Human rights obligations should be similarly mainstreamed 
and safeguarded. 
182.  Reliable data in relation to gender issues is a major deficiency. A strategy needs to 
be put in place to address this, including identifying data needs. Sex disaggregated 
data  needs  to  be  collected  to  improve  the  monitoring  of  the  impact  and 
effectiveness of climate change initiatives and policies. 
183.  Women, men, and youth should be included and engaged as valuable stakeholders 
in identifying and addressing the climate change concerns of their communities, 
and  share  knowledge  for  responses  to  ensure  their  strengthened  resilience. 
Further support should also be commissioned from gender organizations in RMI, 
as well as gender and human rights experts in advocacy, engagement and capacity 
building, and for enhancing gender in sector-specific elements.

Section 7 – Health  
 
Headline Recommendations 
 
  Include  health  considerations  as  part  of  RMI’s  forthcoming  National 
Adaptation Plan. 
 
 
Summary 
184.  Climate change will exacerbate many current climate-sensitive health issues and 
threatens  the  ability  of  health  institutions  and  organizations  to  maintain  and 
improve health services into the future. This is expected to be particularly true in 
low-income  countries  and  Small  Island  Developing  States,  who  are  especially 
vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In particular, climate change will 
disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, including the poor, children, elderly 
and those with pre-existing medical conditions.  
185.  The World Health Organization (WHO)4 predicts that the effects of climate change, 
including storms and flooding, rising sea levels, higher freshwater temperatures, 
reduced  availability  of  food  and  drinking  water,  will  translate  into  increased 
mortality  and  morbidity  from  extreme  weather  events  and  climate-sensitive 
diseases, such as malaria, dengue and cholera. The Paris Agreement specifically 
mentioned the right to health. 
186.  As such it is critical that RMI takes steps to increase the adaptive capacity and 
resilience of its health system. The most effective health adaptation strategies 
take into account that contextual factors as adaptation needs are often highly 
localized. RMI should undertake measures to identify and assess the greatest 
health risks and shortcomings in RMI’s current health system in order to develop 
effective strategies for minimizing the anticipated effects of climate change on 
health outcomes.  
187.  It is therefore recommended that health is clearly considered and included as part 
of RMI’s future NAP. As a starting point studies should be undertaken to develop a 
better  understanding  of  climate-related  health  impacts  in  RMI,  including  on 
vulnerable groups.

Section 8 – Education, Training & Public Awareness 
 
Headline Recommendations 
 
  Include education, training & public awareness considerations as part of 
RMI’s forthcoming National Adaptation Plan. 
 
 
Summary 
188.  The  global  community  has  recognized  that  education  plays  a  key  role  in 
responding to climate change. The Paris Agreement specifically acknowledges the 
importance of  “education, training, public  awareness, public  participation  and 
public access to information” (Article 12) in the fight against climate change.  
189.  UNESCO5 has developed the following five recommendations for policy-makers on 
how climate change education (CCE) and education for sustainable development 
(ESD) can be integrated at the national level:  
  Policy  development:  ESD  is  an  interdisciplinary,  cross-sectoral  approach, 
which aims to prepare people for change by equipping them with a broad 
base  of  knowledge,  skills,  dispositions  and  values.  Governments  need  to 
integrate ESD and CCE into all levels and types of education and across the 
curriculum. 
  Governance and resources: Integrating CCE and ESD into national systems 
requires  high-level  support  from  the  Government,  with  cross-sectoral 
coordination and harmonization. CCE and ESD programs were found to be 
more successful when a national coordination structure was clearly defined. 
  Curriculum development:  Ministries of  Education  and  education  planners 
should review, develop and strengthen their curricula to ensure that CCE and 
ESD feature at all levels of the education system. This will entail creating new 
work units for teachers, and developing new pedagogical approaches with 
greater  emphasis  on  critical  thinking  and  problem-solving  skills.  New 
curricula should be flexible enough to be adaptable to local contexts.  
  Capacity-building of teachers and education planners: Teachers and non-
teaching  staff  need  to  understand  climate  change,  and  have  sufficient, 
locally-adapted materials for classroom use.  
  Public  awareness,  communication  and  stakeholder  involvement: 
Governments should support non-formal education opportunities provided 
                                                 
5 http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233083e.pdf  
 
Page 6 3  
by communities, civil society and the media, all of which play an important 
role  in  conveying  information  about  climate  change  mitigation  and 
adaptation.  
190.  It is recommended that education considerations in the broadest sense are clearly 
considered and included as part of RMI’s future NAP. As a starting point studies 
should  be  undertaken  to  develop  a  better  understanding  of  climate-related 
education issues and needs in RMI, including among vulnerable groups.

Section 9 – Approach & Future Perspectives 
 
Headline Recommendations 
 
  Review and update, as necessary, this 2050 Strategy as a minimum every 
five years – including to recommend targets for inclusion in future NDCs – 
at least one year before RMI submits future NDCs pursuant to the Paris 
Agreement; 
  Collect comments on this first 2050 Strategy from stakeholders – including 
Government, private sector, donors, members of the public  – and use 
them to inform implementation and subsequent updates; 
  Design and implement a domestic process to oversee future reviews and 
revisions of this 2050 Strategy and to monitor its implementation. The TTE 
Committee (or another body) should have a future role in:  
  monitoring the alignment and consistency of relevant legislation, 
policies and measures with the 2050 Strategy; 
  overseeing  the  update  of  the  2050  Strategy  every  five  years  – 
including the goals it contains; 
  monitoring progress towards achievement of RMI’s NDC; and 
  recommending the targets and goals of future RMI NDCs. 
  Ensure due diligence is fulfilled before making significant investments to 
implement this 2050 Strategy, including, as appropriate, peer review, third 
party review and an open and transparent procurement process.  
 
 
A Dynamic 2050 Strategy 
191.  In producing this 2050 Strategy, a strong feeling prevailed among stakeholders 
that existing RMI legislation, measures and policies should be built upon and 
inefficient duplication and replication should be avoided. 
192.  At the same time, this 2050 Strategy should serve as a useful tool in setting the 
context for, and influencing, relevant near, medium and long-term planning and 
decision-making at all levels of stakeholders. As such, the purpose of this 2050 
Strategy  is  to  enable  relevant  RMI  decision-makers  to  make  well-informed 
decisions  based  on  the  full  national  context  and  not  only  on  economic 
considerations. 
193.  The importance of this 2050 Strategy being treated as a dynamic document has 
been strongly emphasized by all categories of stakeholders, who were also of the 
view that it should be improved and refined over time.  
Page 6 5  
194.  A key recommendation is that in order to provide an effective context for policy 
making and planning this 2050 Strategy is reviewed and updated, as necessary, 
as at least every five years, including to identify and consider new and relevant 
technologies and policy options. More immediately, once the key outcomes and 
recommendations from the 2nd National Climate Dialogue and the Partnership 
Dialogue  have  been  identified,  they  should  be  collected  and  used  in  the 
implementation and in future updates of this 2050 Strategy. Other comments 
received in future from stakeholders of all levels – including Government, private 
sector, donors, members of the public – should be similarly collected and used.  
195.  In that sense the 2050 Strategy should be treated as a living document. As such it 
will be critical that the key findings of this 2050 Strategy are disseminated and 
feedback sought. 
196.  Furthermore, updates to this 2050 Strategy should recommend the targets for 
future RMI NDCs one year in advance of the submission to the UNFCCC in line with 
the  Paris  Agreement.  The  updating  process  should  include  stakeholder 
consultation. 
197.  When implementing this 2050 Strategy, in particular when considering short-term 
measures, reference should also be made to RMI’s NDC Partnership Plan. 
198.  A domestic process should be put in place to oversee future reviews and revisions 
of this 2050 Strategy and to monitor its implementation. A critical role will be to 
endure the five-year NDC updating process is undertaken in the context of RMI 
working to deliver on its long-term vision. This overarching function could be 
achieved through maintaining the TTE Committee or by another new or existing 
body. The TTE Committee (or another body) should have a future role in: 
  monitoring the alignment and consistency of relevant legislation, policies and 
measures with the 2050 Strategy; 
  overseeing the update of the 2050 Strategy every five years – including the 
goals it contains; 
  monitoring progress towards achievement of RMI’s current NDC; and 
  recommending the targets and goals in future RMI NDCs. 
199.  Consideration should be given to setting out the status and function of the TTE 
Committee (or other body) in legislation, so as to give it independent standing, 
insulate this 2050 Strategy from political changes, and ensure its longevity. Models 
such as the United Kingdom Climate Change Act 2008 and its Climate Change 
Committee6 should be considered if they offer useful precedents. In any event, the 
UK’s standing offer to provide technical advice and insights into the functioning of 
its Climate Change Act should be taken up. 
200.  As an immediate suggestion, the Environment Minister could usefully report once 
a year to the Nitijela on the state of implementation of the 2050 Strategy. This 
could be done annually, on the day after the opening of the Nitijela in August, and

dedicated to the memory of Minister Mattlan Zackhras whose vision led to the 
production of this 2050 Strategy and who passed away in August of 2017.  
 
Due Diligence 
201.  Decisions  in  the  short  term  have  the  potential  to  lock  RMI  into  a  particular 
development pathway for many years to come. As such RMI should undertake full 
due diligence before making any significant investment decisions related to the 
implementation of this 2050 Strategy. Options could include, as appropriate, peer 
review, third party review and open and transparent procurement processes. This 
is  of  particular  importance  when  deciding  on  technological  options  for 
implementation – there are examples of developing countries being sold outdated 
technologies, obsolete or even outlawed in developed countries (e.g. for failing to 
meet important environmental health standards). 
   
Page 6 7  
Section 10 – Background to the RMI 2050 Strategy 
 
Why Have a 2050 Strategy? 
 
Benefits 
202.  The RMI Cabinet, as well as members of the TTE Committee, have identified 
several benefits to having a 2050 Strategy: 
  A clear framework for RMI’s decision-making and to constantly anchor that in 
a wider vision. Most importantly this 2050 Strategy will set out a long-term 
context that will guard against short-term decision-making inconsistent with 
achieving net zero emissions, including those often driven by donors, partners 
and economic interests; 
  Clarity for the Government and other stakeholders by holistically bringing key 
information, policy and financial requirements together in one place. In turn, 
this can help achieve better domestic coordination; 
  Improved donor coordination. This 2050 Strategy will for the first time provide 
a hierarchy of climate-related needs – and hopefully a discipline – so that 
support can start to flow to where it is needed most, when it is needed most. 
In  other  words,  financial  and  capacity  support  will  for  the  first  time  be 
holistically aligned with our strategic national climate priorities; 
  Delivery of benefits for Marshallese women, men and youth. By asking the 
fundamental question of what kind of country RMI wants to be by 2050, RMI 
will  become  less  reactionary  and  more  proactive  in  its  policy  process. 
Furthermore,  by developing  and  implementing  this  2050  Strategy  through 
consultative  processes  with  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders,  the  RMI 
Government can ensure that the population supports RMI’s climate change 
priorities,  and  has  a  role  in  setting  those  priorities.  In  turn  this  will  help 
translate RMI’s international climate change leadership into tangible benefits 
for Marshallese people on the ground through sustainable, climate resilient 
development; and 
  Maintaining RMI’s international climate leadership by walking the walk, not 
just talking the talk. By taking the steps to produce RMI’s own 2050 Strategy, 
RMI aims to press its international partners to do so as well, including by 
sharing lessons learned. In turn this will support the wider global commitment 
to limit temperature increase to well below 2°C, pursuing efforts to limit it to 
the 1.5 °C cap needed for the survival of RMI.  
 
Commitments under the Paris Agreement  
203.  Having a 2050 Strategy also helps RMI deliver on its commitments under the Paris 
Agreement.  As  the  Agreement  states,  Parties  aim  to  “strengthen  the  global 
Page 6 8  
response  to  the  threat  of  climate  change,  in  the  context  of  sustainable 
development and efforts to eradicate poverty, including by: 
(a) Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 
2°C  above  pre-industrial  levels  and  pursuing  efforts  to  limit  the 
temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing 
that this would significantly reduce the risks and  impacts of climate 
change; 
(b) Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate 
change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions 
development, in a manner that does not threaten food production; and 
(c)  Making  finance  flows  consistent  with  a  pathway  towards  low 
greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development”. (Article 
2(1)) 
204.  The  Paris  Agreement  goes  on  to  invite  Parties  to  strive  to  formulate  and 
communicate  long-term  low  greenhouse  gas  emission  development  strategies 
(2050 Strategies) […](Article 4(19)). In accordance with this, at the Conference of 
the Parties in Marrakesh (COP22), President Heine committed RMI to producing a 
2050 Strategy7. 
205.  The preamble of the Paris Agreement states that: 
“Parties should when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote 
and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the 
rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with 
disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as 
well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity".

The Process that Led to This 2050 Strategy 
 
Timeline & Process for Producing the RMI’s 2050 Strategy 
206.  Timeline and process: 
  21  August  2017  – skeleton  outline  of  the  Strategy  discussed  and 
agreed by the Committee; 
  22/23 August 2017 – RMI Cabinet endorses approach to developing 
2050 Strategy;   
  19-20 July 2018 – 2nd National Climate Dialogue; 
  22-23 July 2018 – NDC Partnership Dialogue; 
  July/August 2018 – revised draft 2050 Strategy; 
  August  2018  –  presented  final  draft  of  Strategy  to  Cabinet  for 
approval; 
  Third quarter 2018 – published RMI’s final 2050 Strategy. 
 
The TTE Committee  
207.  The TTE Committee, comprising key stakeholders, was formed in order to oversee 
the production  and  implementation of  RMI’s 2050  Strategy.  The  Government 
energy planning division has served at the Secretariat to the Committee. 
 
The 2nd RMI National Climate Dialogue Process & Partnership Dialogue 
208.  The 2nd National Climate Dialogue was held on 19-20 July 2018.  
209.  In order to support the delivery and implementation of the 2050 Strategy in the 
future, a Partnership Dialogue took place on 22-23 July 2018. The Partnership 
Dialogue engaged a range of key international stakeholders who will be crucial to 
the realization of the goals of the 2050 Strategy, including through the production 
of an NDC Partnership Plan.  
210.  As recommended above, the outcomes of the Dialogues, as well as the NDC 
Partnership  Plan  should  be  used  to  inform  the  implementation  of  this  2050 
Strategy, as well as its future updates.

Section 11 – Methodologies, Baseline, Projections 
 
11a – Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
 
Methodology  
211.  Data was collected on a variety of inputs which were then used to separately 
calculate carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions, methane (CH ) emissions, and nitrous 
2 4
oxide (N O) emissions. Using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth 
2
Assessment Report’s (IPCC AR5) 100-year global warming potentials, CH  and N O 
4 2
emissions  were  converted  to  CO -equivalent  emissions.  These  three  emission 
2
sources were then summed to arrive at a total of CO -equivalent emissions. Using 
2
2010  and  2015  data,  current  emissions  were  calculated  based  on  fuel 
consumption multiplied by emissions factors. For these emission factors, EPA’s 
2015 estimates were used. Overall, the same approach was followed as used in 
Chapter  Two  of  the  RMI’s  Second  National  Communication  (August  2015) 
regarding emissions that were, or were not, included using the improved data 
collected since this document was published. In some cases, the original IPCC GHG 
protocol equations were used to calculate emissions. 
212.  Data collected to produce this 2050 Strategy included: population data, burning 
and recycling rates, waste generation, copra production, fossil fuel consumption 
(kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas, diesel, gasoline, etc.), cooking demand, fuel 
efficiency, electricity system losses, electricity loads and consumption, levels of 
current renewables penetration, renewable resources and performance, number 
of vehicles driven, and vehicle miles per year. 
213.  In addition to the Second National Communication, another point of reference 
was the RMI’s NDC, which projects emissions reductions in 2025 and 2030 from a 
baseline in 2010. This 2050 Strategy therefore also uses the baseline year of 2010. 
The Second National Communication notably does not account for emissions from 
the waste sector. In developing its NDC, RMI updated its emissions inventory to 
include the waste sector. However, data collection for this sector is poor and 
requires  revision  in  the  Third  National  Communication.  Similarly,  the  Second 
National  Communication  disregarded  incineration  or  burning  emissions.  More 
recent 2017 studies show that burning is prevalent in RMI, so this source of 
emissions was included in the emissions inventory used to develop the 2050 
Strategy.  
214.  The 2010 baseline emissions estimate relies on an extrapolation of a bottom-up 
calculation that accounts for 80% of RMI’s population. The revised estimate of 
168,000 metric tons (Mtons) is aligned with estimates made by the RMI Electricity 
Roadmap and is in close agreement to the 170,000 Mtons estimate made in the 
Second National Communication.

Figure 25: RMI’s Greenhouse Gas Scenario – NDC 
 
215.  RMI produced its NDC in 2015. The key provisions of the NDC state that: 
  RMI  commits  to  a  quantified  economy-wide  target  to  reduce  its 
emissions of GHG to 32% below 2010 levels by 2025; 
  RMI communicates, as an indicative target, its intention to reduce its 
emissions of GHGs to 45% below 2010 levels by 2030; 
  These targets put RMI on a trajectory to nearly halve GHG emissions 
between  2010  and  2030,  with  a  view  to  achieving  net  zero  GHG 
emissions by 2050, or earlier if possible.  
216.  The  NDC  also  contains  sections  in  relation  to  adaptation  and  means  of 
implementation. 
217.  Since RMI seeks to significantly reduce its emissions and explore pathways to zero 
emissions  by  2050  goal,  the  Moderate  Scenario  is  not  a  “business  as  usual” 
scenario, but rather assumes significant renewables penetration and efficiency 
improvements. The Lighthouse Scenario assumes maximal effort, implemented 
rapidly,  whereas  the  Significant  Scenario  assumes  the  same  actions  as  the 
Lighthouse Scenario delayed by 15 years due to presumed lack of funds.  
218.  The quantitative analysis and scenarios on which the 2050 Strategy is based is 
focused on Majuro and Ebeye because they are the main population centers and 
because relevant environmental data is most readily available in these cities. From 
this base, assumptions and recommendations can be extended to other parts of 
RMI.  
219.  The specifics of the choices and assumptions made in relation to the scenarios, 
pathways or measures set out in this 2050 Strategy may likely change in the 
Page 7 2  
future,  as  technology  improvements,  costs,  local  preferences  and  market 
acceptance, as well as financial constraints, all change over time. As a next step, 
further  feasibility  studies  and/or  pilot  projects  are  recommended  in  order  to 
validate  and  verify  that  these  pathways  are  feasible  in  RMI.  On  this  basis, 
assumptions made should be modified and the model improved in the future. 
 
11b – Adaptation, Environmental Information  
& Means of Implementation 
 
220.  The  analysis  underpinning  the  parts  of  this  2050  Strategy  unrelated  to  GHG 
emissions reductions – including on adaptation, environmental information and 
means of implementation - was based on data collected through interviews with 
key RMI stakeholders as well as desktop reviews of relevant materials.
