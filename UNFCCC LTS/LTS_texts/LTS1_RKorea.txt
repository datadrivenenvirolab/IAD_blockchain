Executive  Summary2050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
1.  Background
▍Why  we  should  act  now
Massive wildfires, typhoons, heatwaves, and snowstorms caused by global warming have 
become almost a part of daily life and can be seen easily around the globe. Korea is not 
immune to such effects of global warming. In Korea, the rate of warming accelerated in 
recent years, with the average temperature rise for the past 30 years reaching 1.4°C, and 
the warming is expected to pick up more speed in the coming years. 
Recognizing the urgency of the climate change issue, the international community adopted 
the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 mandating developed countries to cut their greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions. The Paris Agreement joined by developing and developed countries was adopted 
in 2015 and entered into force on 4 November 2016 thanks to the active and coordinated 
efforts of the international community. Korea ratified the Agreement on 3 November 2016. 
The goal of the Paris Agreement is to hold the increase in the global average temperature 
to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the increase to 
1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) adopted the Special Report on 
Global Warming of 1.5°C after intense discussions at its 48th session held in Incheon, Korea 
in October 2018. The Special Report provides solid scientific evidence for the 1.5°C target 
agreed by the international community when adopting the Paris Agreement.
The Special Report suggests pathways that global net anthropogenic CO  emissions decline 
2
by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reach net zero around 2050, for limiting 
global warming to 1.5°C by 2100.
▍How  the  long-term  strategy  was  developed
The Paris Agreement recommends that all Parties strive to formulate and communicate 
Long-term  low  greenhouse  gas  Emission  Development  Strategies  (LEDS)  by  2020  as 
long-term vision for responding to climate change.
To participate in the efforts of the international community to address climate change, the 
Government of the Republic of Korea decided to develop its LEDS. The 2050 Low-carbon 
Vision Forum was established to listen to various opinions of experts from private sector 
in  the  preparatory  stage  of  its  LEDS.  The  Forum  consisted  of  experts  from  academia, 
6 | Executive Summary
industry, and civil society, who closely examined and reviewed a broad spectrum of options 
for Korea’s vision and targets in reducing 2050 GHG emissions by 2050. The Forum drafted 
a proposal, which later was utilized for the Government’s inter-ministerial discussions as 
well as for national consultations to collect opinions from diverse stakeholders in order 
to establish this Strategy.
Afterwards,  a  government-wide  consultative  body  comprised  of  representatives  from  15 
ministries1)  conducted  online  surveys,  expert  consultations,  and  public  discussions  and 
hearings, and diverse opinions from industry, civil society, and the youth were incorporated 
in this Strategy.
2.  Korea’s  2050  Vision
▍Our  2050  Vision
Under the principle of contributing to global climate action, laying foundation for sustainable 
and carbon-neutral society, and encouraging actions at all levels of stakeholders, Korea’s 
2050 Vision is established as follows: 
The Republic  of  Korea moves towards  the  goal  of  carbon neutrality by 2050. 
The Korean New Deal will serve as a stepping stone to reach carbon neutrality by 
2050. Korea will harness green innovations and advanced digital technologies to create 
synergies between the Green New Deal and the Digital New Deal, the two pillars of 
the Korean New Deal. Korea will also take decisive action especially in supporting and 
investing  in  the  development  of  innovative  climate  technologies  to  achieve  carbon 
neutrality by 2050. 
Tackling climate change requires global efforts and collective engagement. Korea will 
lead by example to help the international community jointly make efforts to reach 
carbon  neutrality  by  2050.

The Government of the Republic of Korea | 72050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
▍Key  elements  of  the  2050  Vision
The Strategy outlines the following five key elements that will guide Korea’s policymaking, 
social transformation and technological innovations for its green transition. 
➊ Expanding the use of clean power and hydrogen across all sectors
➋ Improving energy efficiency to a significant level
➌ Commercial deployment of carbon removal and other future technologies
➍ Scaling up the circular economy to improve industrial sustainability
➎ Enhancing carbon sinks
3.  Visions  and  strategies  by  sector
▍Energy  sector
In  2017,  emissions  from  the  energy  sector  accounted  for  36%  of  the  total  emissions. 
Therefore, producing electricity in an eco-friendly manner without GHG emissions and using 
such green power in greater scope is the most essential mitigation strategy to achieve Korea’s 
2050 Vision. 
To achieve carbon neutrality in the energy sector by 2050, clean and renewable energy, 
i.e., solar and wind, should become central power sources. However, renewable energy has 
volatility and intermittency issues, as it is sourced from the nature, and these issues need 
to be addressed for its wider deployment. 
To this end, the Government will develop an accurate power demand and supply forecasting 
system and provide enhanced support for future innovative technologies, e.g., Energy Storage 
System (ESS) for reliable power supply, and hydrogen fuel cells for auxiliary power sources. 
Korea plans to phase out coal power plants or convert them into LNG power plants. In 
addition, Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) technology will be applied to 
coal-fired power plants to minimize GHG emissions.
8 | Executive Summary
▍Industry  sector
The industry sector was estimated to be responsible for 37% of Korea’s total GHG emissions 
in 2017. In the industry sector, we will continue to identify and foster future industries 
for  growth  while  drawing  up  plans  to  strengthen  industry  competitiveness  taking  into 
account the global mitigation trends as well as the characteristics of each industry.
First and foremost, we need to achieve low-carbon transition in energy-intensive industries, 
i.e., steel, cement and petrochemicals production. Improving energy efficiency, transition 
towards circular economy, using low-carbon fuels and materials are possible strategies the 
industry sector can adopt. Measures to reduce F-gas emissions should be taken as well.
The  Government  and  the  industry  sector  will  work  together  to  scale  up  investment  in 
applying  new  future  technologies  and  developing  technological  innovations  for  the 
low-carbon transition of existing industrial processes. The prime example could be hydrogen 
reduction steelmaking, and Carbon Capture and Utilization for petrochemicals production. 
The  Government  will  also  work  on  building  a  robust  institutional  framework  and 
infrastructure necessary for such technologies’ deployment to industrial sites.
The Government plans to: i) facilitate the industry sector’s transition to a high-value-added 
structure  by  combining  ICT  to  the  existing  industries;  ii)  use  regulatory  measures  in 
combination with incentives to improve energy efficiency; and iii) strengthen policies and 
technology developments for reusing wastes as resources that could dramatically reduce the 
use of raw materials and fuels for the purpose of efficient use of resources.
▍Transportation  sector
Emissions from the transportation sector accounted for 14% of Korea’s total emissions in 
2017.  The  transportation  sector’s  growth  is  largely  being  driven  by  the  development  of 
Industry 4.0 technologies with two dominating keywords: green and intelligence. 
A modal shift is expected to take place from existing petroleum-based transportation system 
into future mobility featuring eco-friendly and autonomous vehicles. The Government will 
scale up its support for future mobility for its enhanced competitiveness and take policies 
in conjunction with fuel efficiency regulations to promote the use of low-carbon fuels.
The Government plans to: i) promote the use of public transportation; ii) expand shared 
mobility; iii) build systems for traffic demand management and intelligent transportation; 
iv) reduce energy consumption by promoting commercial use of autonomous vehicles; and 
v)  promote  the  modal  shift  from  road  to  rail  or  shipping,  the  low-carbon  modes  of 
transportation.

▍Building  sector
The  building  sector  was  estimated  to  emit  7%  of  the  total  national  emissions  in  2017. 
Minimizing the energy use in the building sector, while maximizing the energy efficiency 
and supplying low-carbon energy, is the most cost-effective mitigation option that can reduce 
the energy cost and GHG emissions at the same time. 
The  Government  plans  to  use  a  combination  of  regulatory  measures  and  incentives  in 
two-track approaches for: i) newly-built buildings and ii) old buildings. Starting from 2020, 
all new public buildings to be built will be subject to the zero-energy building standards, 
and from 2030, all new public and private buildings (with gross floor area of 5 million 
㎡ or larger) will be subject to the standards. Old buildings, if they adopt green remodeling 
solutions, will be eligible for government incentives such as tax cuts and grants for interest 
expenses.
Along  with  improving  energy  efficiency,  using  low-carbon  energy  sources  is  another 
important mitigation strategy. Wall-mounted solar panels could contribute to decarbonizing 
power generation within buildings. Geothermal energy, hydro power and waste heat from 
power generation and incineration could replace fossil fuels used for heating/cooling of 
buildings. Improving energy efficiency and enabling passive and active houses is the core 
strategy to achieve the building sector’s 2050 vision.
▍Waste  sector
Emissions from the waste sector in 2017 took up 2.4% of Korea’s total GHG emissions. 
It is important to maximize resource efficiency while minimizing resource inputs throughout 
the  entire  product  lifecycle  – from  the  extraction  of  natural  resources,  to  production, 
distribution and consumption of products, to recycling and disposal of their waste – and 
creating a virtuous cycle where resources are reused and recycled repeatedly. This circular 
system will fundamentally reduce the amount of wastes generated at source. 
The waste sector’s strategy seeks to identify ways to convert wastes into useful materials 
and reuse them as energy sources. Any unrecycled wastes left should be disposed of in 
an eco-friendly manner. Plastics are one of the most serious problems in this sector that 
should be dealt with urgently, and measures to phase out plastics need to be established 
for a plastic-free society. 
▍Farming  sector
The agriculture, livestock farming and fisheries sector (collectively referred to as “farming 
sector”)  contributed  3.4%  (including  emissions  from  using  energy)  to  the  total  GHG 
10 | Executive Summary
emissions in Korea in 2017. GHG emissions from the farming sector mostly come from 
the  biological  reactions  taking  place  from  food  production  processes.  Therefore,  it  is 
impossible to remove the sector’s entire GHG emissions, but still there are many mitigation 
technologies available for use.
ICT-enabled smart farming could minimize inputs (i.e., energy sources, fertilizers, water, 
etc.), and farm automation could further improve productivity. Therefore, the Government 
plans to scale up the deployment of smart technologies on farms. To reduce GHG emissions 
originating from crop cultivation and livestock farming, it is essential to develop and deploy 
low-carbon  farming  practices  and  replace  fossil  fuels  used  on  farms  with  clean  energy 
sources. 
▍Carbon  sinks
In 2017, CO  removals by forests and other carbon sinks recorded 45.7 million ton CO eq, 
2 2
offsetting 7.4% of the energy sector’s CO emissions. However, when forests age, their net 
2 
growth volume declines rapidly, driving down carbon removals as well. Considering the 
current state of forests and timber production plans, carbon removal is estimated to decrease 
by 30% from the current level by 2050. Innovative forest management, therefore, is a key 
to improving the aging forest structure, promoting the use of wood products/timber and 
increasing carbon stocks. The Government plans to increase carbon sinks by creating urban 
green  spaces  for  recreational  use,  restoring  degraded  forestlands  and  tree-planting  in 
underutilized lands. The Government will continue its forest management to maintain the 
forest  carbon  removals  at  the  highest  level  possible  by  changing  tree  species  and 
implementing programs to keep the forests healthy.
4.  Innovating  implementation  base
To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, we need a nationwide transformation that is supported 
by robust and sustainable institutional framework. 
The Government will align its climate and energy policies to create synergies between them 
and consider climate change impacts when establishing fiscal policy directions and values. 
The Government will also aim to build a carbon pricing mechanism that could internalize 
climate and environmental externalities and encourage economic actors to reduce emissions, 
with public sector taking leadership towards carbon-neutrality transition. 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 112050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
To translate the awareness on climate change into people’s concrete action, we will enhance 
our public outreach and education functions in collaboration with local communities. For 
our journey towards the 2050 carbon neutrality, a social conflict management system will 
be built to ensure a just transition for all. 
In addition, green finance strategies will be laid out to change the course of our economy 
into a greener direction. A proactive approach will be key to ensure that policies are closely 
integrated to promote technological convergence and scale up R&D for innovations in order 
to move towards a carbon-neutral society by 2050. 
5.  Way  forward
The 2050 carbon neutrality is a mission that should be pursued in a robust and consistent 
manner for the next 30 years. After presenting this Strategy, the Government will build 
a stronger governance structure, including by establishing the Presidential 2050 Carbon 
Neutrality Committee for systematic implementation of the Strategy and take necessary next 
steps to achieve the 2050 carbon neutrality.

1.1 Signs  of  climate  change
▍Extreme  weather  events
In October 2018, the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C released its finding 
that human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0°C of global warming 
above the 1850-1900 period, with a likely range of 0.8-1.2°C as of 2017. The report has 
also found that estimated anthropogenic global warming is currently increasing at 0.2°C 
per decade and global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues 
to increase at the current rate.
Extreme weather events are not unusual anymore. They can be experienced in many parts 
of the world. In June 2019, Europe saw its average temperature climb up to 25-29°C, 7-9°C 
up from the average year. Other regions also reported record-high summer temperatures 
in recent years. In 2018, the U.S. and Canada experienced the most severe cold waves and 
snowstorms in 100 years while massive wildfires on an unprecedented scale hit Australia 
and the Amazon rainforest. 
▍Climate  change  impacts  in  Korea
Korea is no exception in this trend. For the past century, the average temperature in Korea 
has risen 1.8°C, which is higher than the global average (0.8-1.2°C). Annual rainfall has 
also increased by nearly 160 mm. The average temperature for the past 30 years in Korea 
has soared 1.4°C, indicating climate change has been exacerbated. Rainfall intensity is also 
showing a polarizing trend of more heavy rain events and less moderate-intensity rain. A 
comparison  between  30-year  blocks,  1912-1941  and  1988-2017,  demonstrates  a  growing 
trend of longer summers and shorter winters.

▍Projecting  future  climate  in  Korea
The  recent  reports  by  the  IPCC2)  projected  that  the  increase  of  global  mean  surface 
temperature by the end of the 21st century (2081-2100) is likely to be in the range of 
0.3-4.8°C under its RCPs3). For the same period, the sea level rise is predicted to be in 
the  range  of  0.26-0.92  m.  Based  on  the  IPCC  report  and  its  scenarios,  the  Korea 
Meteorological Administration has projected the future climate of the Korean Peninsula in 
the second half of the 21st century. The projection indicates the pace of warming on the 
peninsula is expected to be faster than the global projection suggested in the IPCC report. 
When  RCP2.6  is  applied  to  the  Korean  Peninsula,  the  temperature  and  precipitation 
increases are likely to be 1.8°C and 5.5%, respectively. RCP8.5 suggests that the temperature 
and precipitation on the Korean Peninsula will rise by 4.7°C and 13.1%, respectively. The 
subtropical climate zone, previously located only on the South Sea shore, is expected to 
expand and move northward. Extreme heat indicators, such as days of heatwaves and tropical 
nights, are predicted to rise while indicators for cold weather, such as days of cold waves,

1.2 How  the  Paris  Agreement  was  conceived
▍Limitations  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol
Recognizing the urgency of the climate change issue, the international community came 
together and adopted the Kyoto Protocol in December 1997, which later came into effect 
in  February  2005.  The  Protocol,  an  implementing  arm  of  the  1992  United  Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, has put the obligations to reduce GHG emissions 
on developed countries. Currently, there are 192 Parties to the Protocol, and Korea has 
become a Party as of 25 September 1998.
Despite such achievements, the Protocol had clear limitations: i) some developed countries 
refused to ratify the Protocol or withdrew from it; ii) developing countries were not obligated 
to reduce emissions at all; and iii) the Protocol had limited commitment periods, and its 
18 | Chapter 1 Introduction & Background
consistency after that periods was uncertain. Due to these limitations, the countries decided  Intro

to establish a new climate regime. uc

d
After  15  rounds  of  long-term  negotiations  since  2012,  the  Paris  Agreement,  joined  by 
developing  and  developed  countries,  was  adopted  in  2015.  After  the  adoption,  the 
international community swiftly acted together, and the Agreement came into force as of 
4 November 2016. Korea ratified the agreement on 3 November 2016. 
▍Features  of  the  Paris  Agreement
The goal of the Paris Agreement is to hold the increase in the global average temperature 
to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial 
levels. The Paris Agreement includes adaptation as an important element and lays out the 
essential means of implementations such as finance, technology and capacity building, to 
help developing countries achieve mitigation and adaptation targets. 
The Paris Agreement requires all Parties to determine their own Nationally Determined 
Contributions (NDCs), including GHG emissions reduction targets and implement them 
ensuring  transparency.  Each  Party  shall  communicate  an  NDC  every  five  years  in 
consideration of the goals of the Agreement. Each Party’s successive NDC will represent 
a progression beyond the Party’s then current NDC.
Parties shall report the national greenhouse gas inventory and information on mitigation 
policies and support through the transparency framework to the United Nations. The global 
stocktake continuously reviews global emissions levels, adaptation efforts, implementation, 
financial support, and the adequacy of the Parties’ NDCs for achieving the goals of the 
Agreement. 
1.3 Adoption  of  the  IPCC  Special  Report  on  1.5°C
In October 2018, Korea hosted the 48th session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change in Songdo, Incheon, where the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C 
was approved after intense discussion. The IPCC report was prepared from the request of 
the UNFCCC to provide solid scientific evidence for the 1.5°C goal, the target agreed upon 
at the time of adopting the Paris Agreement. 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 192050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
▍Conditions  to  meet  the  1.5°C  target
The IPCC wrote in the special report that limiting global warming to 1.5°C by 2100 would 
require rapid, far-reaching, and unprecedented transitions in all sectors of society. According 
to the report, utilizing global mean surface air temperature provides an estimate of the 
remaining carbon budget of 580 GtCO  for a 50% probability of limiting warming to 1.5°C, 
2
and 420 GtCO  for a 66% probability. Alternatively, using global mean surface temperature 
2
gives estimates of 770 and 570 GtCO , for probabilities of 50% and 66%, respectively. In 
2
model pathways indicated in the report, global net anthropogenic CO  emissions decline 
2
by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero around 2050. For limiting global 
warming to below 2°C, the report suggests that CO emissions are projected to decline by 
2 
about 25% by 2030 from the 2010 level and reach net zero around 2070. 
The report specifies that the pathways that overshoot 1.5°C of global warming rely on CO
2 
removal measures to return to below 1.5°C by 2100. However, the report also warns that 
the impacts of CO removal measures, if deployed on a large scale, are still unproven and 
2 
could have potential trade-offs with sustainable development.

▍Time  for  Action ck
g
ro
u
“Action” was the key word for global climate response throughout the year of 2019. The  n
d
United Nations held the Climate Action Summit in New York in September 2019, and the 
main  theme  of  COP25  in  the  same  year  was  “Time  for  Action.”  Globally,  there  was 
widespread recognition that now is the time that countries should come together to take 
climate action. 
The youth, those who will be one of the most affected by climate change, have already 
started their action. Over 1 million young people from nearly 100 countries participated 
in “school strikes for climate” to demand action from political leaders. In Korea, prior to 
the Climate Action Summit, youths and the activists from civil society, academia, religious 
groups came together to call for urgent action. 
▍International  community’s  movement
The international community is answering the call from the youth. The UN Secretary-General 
also stressed that at the 11th Petersburg Climate Dialogue held in April 2020, all countries 
should commit to carbon neutrality by 2050 to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5°C.
Fossil fuel is rapidly giving way to renewable energy while coal power is being phased out. 
Green cars powered by alternative fuels are widely deployed across markets, and green 
investments are scaling up. Since the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015, 65.7% (178GW) 
of the global investment in energy facilities has been focused on renewables, most notably 
photovoltaics and wind power. Coal power is increasingly recognized as a stranded asset 
worldwide. Global demand for new coal-fired power plants has been in steep decline since 
its peak in 20154). The EU, Canada and many other countries are declaring that they are 
moving away from coal power generation. 
Financial investments are becoming greener as well. Along with the OECD guideline5) on 
export credits relating to coal-fired power generation projects, the Financial Stability Board6), 
upon  the  G20’s  request,  launched  a  Taskforce  on  Climate-related  Financial  Disclosures 
(TCFD) that recommends all companies including financial firms disclose information on 
climate change-related financial risks in a transparent manner. The recommendation is based 
on the scenario of achieving the Paris Agreement’s 2°C target. The Ministry of Environment 
of Korea has declared its support for the TCFD in May 2020.

1.5 Why  we  should  take  climate  action
▍From  climate  change  to  climate  emergency
Climate change-induced natural disasters in all forms – heatwaves, snowstorms, typhoons, 
wildfires, for example – are taking place globally. The catastrophic disasters are wreaking 
havoc on human life in various forms: food scarcity, floods and diseases. The impacts of 
climate change are palpable now, which means it is as damaging for us as it will be for 
our children, and therefore, immediate action needs to be taken. 
Unfortunately, however, our time is limited. We will have only 10 years left to achieve the 
1.5°C target given the remaining carbon budget indicated in the IPCC Special Report. 
▍Cost  and  benefit  of  climate  action
The key to reducing GHG emissions and responding to climate change is to use less fossil 
fuel. Inevitably, the economy and industry will suffer a short-term impact from it. However, 
the losses and damages from inaction could be far greater than the short-term economic 
and industrial impact.
In  its  working  paper,  the  IMF  warned7)  that  a  persistent  increase  in  average  global 
temperature by 0.04°C, in the absence of mitigation policies, reduces world real GDP per 
capita by more than 7% by 2100. On the other hand, abiding by the Paris Agreement, thereby 
limiting the temperature increase to 0.01°C per annum reduces the loss substantially to 
1.07%. According to the 
Financial Stability Board, the value at risk to manageable assets from climate change is 
estimated at about USD 4 trillion8). The International Renewable Energy Agency also warns 
that slow progress of emissions mitigation will result in stranded assets worth nearly USD 
12 trillion9).
For Korea, implementing mitigation policies has a clear co-benefit, which is improved air 
quality. GHG emissions and air pollutants originate from the same source – burning fossil 
fuels– therefore, mitigation policies to reduce GHG emissions, when implemented, have a 
huge co-benefit of reducing airborne particulate matters.

2.1 Objectives  of  the  Paris  Agreement
The  Paris  Agreement  calls  for  all  Parties  to  hold  the  increase  in  the  global  average 
temperature  to  well  below  2°C  and  pursue  efforts  to  limit  the  increase  to  1.5°C  above 
pre-industrial levels. The Agreement further recommends that all Parties strive to formulate 
and communicate Long-term low greenhouse gas Emission Development Strategies (LEDS) 
by 2020 as long-term vision for responding to climate change. As a Party to the Paris 
Agreement, Korea decided to answer this global call for climate action by developing its 
LEDS. In September 2019, President Moon Jae-in attended the UN Climate Action Summit 
in New York to indicate Korea’s commitment to presenting the Strategy to the international 
community by the end of 2020.  
2.2 Why  Korea  needs  its  long-term  strategy
▍Recalibrating  national  climate  policy
As a Party to the Paris Agreement, Korea will update and communicate its NDC that includes 
its updated 2030 GHG emissions reduction target to the UNFCCC Secretariat by the end 
of 2020. Korea’s LEDS is based on this updated NDC. The Strategy includes our 2050 Vision 
that will determine the general directions to which our climate policy should be headed 
by 2050. Establishing the Strategy demanded extensive analyses on the entire range of our 
current mitigation policies. It required a closer look at where emissions come from, how 
energy is supplied, and what mitigation technologies are available. The works of preparing 
the Strategy also provided a valuable opportunity, most importantly, to lay out our 2050 
Vision and sectoral strategies after reaching public consensus on them. 
▍Establishing  a  national  vision  for  a  carbon-neutral  society 
Realizing a carbon-neutral society is a vision that can be achieved only when shared with 
and  understood  by  all  members  of  society.  The  Strategy  outlines  the  2050  Vision  that 
harmonizes  Korea’s economic,  social,  environmental  and  energy  policies and sets out a 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 232050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
common direction into which we all should be headed to achieve the Vision. The Strategy 
also proposes solutions to address potential challenges that could pose obstacles in that 
path towards a carbon-neutral future.
We understand that now we need a long-term vision at the national level and consistent 
policies  to  achieve  that  vision  to  turn  the  carbon  neutrality  expectations  shared  across 
government, industry, and people into concrete action. A clear national vision will serve 
as a beacon for people to act and for businesses and other stakeholders to make sensible 
investment decisions for the future. The Strategy will send a strong signal for Korea’s climate 
policies. 
The 2050 Vision in the Strategy will help develop a shared understanding that a fossil 
fuel-dependent economy and society will no longer be sustainable in the future. The Vision 
will  open  up  broader  discussions  around  fair  burden-sharing  necessary  to  achieve  the 
ultimate  goal  of  sustainable  economic  and  social  prosperity  where  economic  and 
environmental benefits go hand in hand. 
▍Using  the  Carbon  Neutral  Strategy  as  a  driver  for  future  growth
Korea’s  industries  import  most  of  their  energy  sources  from  overseas.  Most  prominent 
energy-intensive industries – steelmaking, petrochemicals and semiconductors production 
– are the backbones of Korea’s industrial growth. Cutting down fossil fuel use, under such 
circumstances, clearly poses a huge challenge for Korea. However, for the future generations’ 
survival  and  their  sustainable  future,  the  task  of  reducing  GHG  emissions  is  a  global 
challenge that must be met, and this challenge should be considered as an opportunity 
for future growth. 
Korea’s highly developed ICT and leading technologies of electric vehicles (EVs) and Energy 
Storage System (ESS) provide an enabling environment for a convergence between green 
innovations and Industry 4.0 technologies. Such convergence is expected to give rise to 
a  new  wave  of  the  low-carbon  industry  that  will  replace  conventional  energy-intensive 
industry. 
The Strategy will present meaningful opportunities for us to start recognizing that moving 
towards carbon neutrality is a formula for future growth.

3.1 The  2050  Low-carbon  Vision  Forum nd
▍Operating  the  2050  Low-carbon  Vision  Forum
Implementing  the  Strategy  requires  a  comprehensive  level  of  transformation  across  the 
economy, industry, energy, environment, technology and people’s daily lives. Considering 
the far-reaching scope of the transformation, we have established the 2050 Low-carbon 
Vision Forum participated by academia, industry, and civil society from the initial stage 
of developing the Strategy. What was discussed at the Forum by experts from various fields 
has provided significant inputs for the preparation of the Strategy. 
The Forum was attended by 69 experts from seven sub-committees, each recommended 
by their respective professional fields. The Forum’s technical working group comprised of 
experts  from  national  research  institutes  and  thinktanks10)  supported  the  Forum’s 
decision-making  process  by  offering  assessments  and  analytics  of  different  emissions 
reduction scenarios.

Projections for population growth, GDP increase and industrial structure by 2050 were used 
to estimate the Business-As-Usual (BAU) level in 2050. Against this BAU scenario, a multiple 
number of scenarios suggesting a different level of targets and visions were produced and 
reviewed by the Forum. In the process, all circumstances affecting Korea’ mitigation efforts 
–  policies,  institutional  frameworks  and  government  budgets  –  were  considered  in 
conjunction  with  the  feasibilities  of  available  mitigation  technologies  and  international 
trends. 
▍Implications  of  the  Forum’s  proposal 
The Forum drafted a proposal that contained the result of intensive analyses and discussions 
by its members, who are the leading climate and energy experts in Korea. The Forum’s 
proposal  become  a  basis  for  the  Government’s  followed  work  of  collecting  wider  social 
opinions and establishing the Strategy. 
3.2 Social  dialogue
▍Online  survey
An open public online survey was conducted for the period of two months (June-July 2020) 
to  promote  the  LEDS.  The  survey  responses  were  supplemented  with  a  field  research 
conducted  by  a  professional  polling  agency  to  understand  what  the  general  public  and 
business  sector  expect  for  the  LEDS.  Nearly  3,000  people  answered  the  online 
questionnaires,  which  comprised  58  questions  on  the  recognition  of  climate  change, 
intention to take part in climate action, and priority of climate policies. The results show 
that the majority of respondents were recognizing the climate crisis and agreed on the need 
to consider 2050 carbon neutrality. Most respondents believed that carbon neutrality by 
2050 requires consideration of its economic and social impacts12).
12) On climate risk, 91.5% responded that climate change is serious and 96.8% thought climate change is affecting their daily life 
to a significant extent. On 2050 climate neutrality, 92.5% answered that Korea needs to consider 2050 carbon neutrality. The 
respondents chose economic and social impacts (58.9%), the goals of the Paris Agreement (42.2%), and LEDS targets of other 
countries (33.9%) as major concerns that need to be considered in considering carbon neutrality.

The experts shared different perspectives and ideas on policy obstacles and technical barriers 
of  the  transition  to  a  low  carbon  society  and  offered  possible  solutions,  which  were 
incorporated in drafting this Strategy.
▍Public  Discussion
An open public forum was held on 17 October 2020 to listen to people’s views and ideas 
and encourage them to play as the main actor in climate change response.
Under the theme of “Challenges and Tasks of Establishing 2050 LEDS for the Transition 
towards Carbon Neutrality,” the forum addressed five key areas of energy, industry, building, 
transport, and social transition. The keynote presentations were delivered under the titles 
of “IPCC Assessment of Climate Change,” and “Features of 2050 LEDS and Global Trends.” 
Expert presentations were delivered, followed by Q&A sessions.
The  forum’s  participants  who  had  been  invited  based  on  the  consideration  of  regional, 
gender, and age mix were asked to answer a questionnaire on the vision of Korea’s LEDS. 
The results showed that 91% of the participants agreed on the pursuit of carbon neutrality 
by 2050, and 81% were willing to bear their share of the cost for decarbonization. The 
result of the forum and the survey were incorporated in drafting Korea’s 2050 Vision and 
this Strategy.

1.1 Current  Status
▍Total  emissions
In 2017, the total GHG emissions in Korea were 709.1 million tCO eq of GHGs13), which 
2
is 2.4% up from the previous year (692.6 million tCO eq) and 142.7% up from 1990 level 
2
(292.2 million tCO eq). The year-on-year emissions trend from 1990 to 1997 presented a 
2
sharp growth with average annual increase at 8.1%, having an exception in 1998 when the 
GHG  emissions  decreased  by  14.1%  year-on-year  as  the  national  economy  was  in  the 
aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. 
From the 2000s as the economy started rebounding, both the emissions level and GDP 
began to rise. In the 2000s, the emissions growth has slowed down significantly, and since 
201314), has maintained a stable level without much fluctuation.

Korea’s GHG emissions per GDP has declined in general since the 1990s. Until 1997, GHG 
emissions grew at a pace comparable to the economic growth causing little change in the 
level  of  emissions  per  GDP.  However,  the  emissions  growth  has  been  outpaced  by  the 
economic growth from 1998, which led to a continuous decline in emissions per GDP to 
date.  Although  this  could  represent  a  relative  decoupling  of  emissions  from  economic 
growth15), an absolute decoupling16) has not been realized given that the emissions growth 
itself has not reversed into a decline. 
15) In this Strategy, when GDP growth rate is higher than GHG emissions growth rate, we assume relative decoupling has been 
achieved.
16) In this Strategy, when GHG emissions decrease while GDP increases, we assume absolute decoupling has been achieved.

1.2 Korea’s  emissions  level  in  comparison
In 2016, Korea was estimated to be the 11th largest GHG emitter in the world17). The total 
emissions amounted to 5.7% of the emissions of China and 10.7% of the U.S., which are 
respectively world’s first and second largest emitters.  
However, having a high CO  emissions ratio from fuel combustion at 87% of the total GHG 
2
emissions, Korea’s CO  emissions ranks 7th in the world and 4th among the OECD members 
2
following the U.S., Japan, and Germany.
17) The estimation was made based on the analysis of statistical data by UNFCCC. The data includes emissions from top 15 emitting 
countries as of 2016. For the Non-annex I states whose recent emissions data is not available, the CO emissions percentage 
2
estimated by the World Resources Institute and International Energy Agency was used.

▍Background a's
 ClimChap
The  Paris  Agreement  requires  all  Parties  to  prepare  NDCs  periodically.  Following  the  ate ter 2
P
decision of COP 19 held in Lima (1/CP.19), majority of the Parties submitted their INDCs  olic
ie
s
in 2015, and as they ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016, their INDCs have been registered 
as NDCs. The decision of COP 21 held in Paris (1/CP.21) requests Parties to update or 
communicate their NDCs by 2020. 
To implement its NDC that includes 2030 GHG emissions reduction target, Korea conducted 
analyses of reduction potentials in eight key sectors: power (electricity and heating), industry, 
transport, building, agriculture and livestock farming, wastes, public, and forestry. Based 
on  the  analyses,  sectoral  reduction  targets  were  set,  which  were  included  in  the  2030 
Roadmap to Achieve National GHG Reduction Target (2030 Roadmap) formulated in 2016. 
After President Moon Jae-in took office, Korea updated the 2030 Roadmap and released 
the revision in 2018. The revision minimized the portion of the overseas reduction due 
to  the  uncertainty  in  its  implementation.  The  Administration’s  energy  transition  plan 
including shutting down old coal power plants and increasing renewable energy target was 
also incorporated in the revision.
▍Conditions  for  mitigation
Since the beginning of the industrialization, Korea has maintained its export-led industry 
structure with manufacturing at the center. Manufacturing sector accounted for 32.1% of 
the GDP in 2017, and export dependency (export to GDP ratio) also remained high at 35.3%. 
Meanwhile, Korea is the world’s 8th largest energy consumer, with its GDP ranking 12th 
in the world, and the amount of energy use is constantly growing. For the period from 
2000 to 2017, Korea’s final energy consumption increased by 53%; especially the industry 
sector which consumed 60% of the total energy use presented a 68% increase for the same 
period. 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 332050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
Energy intensive industries such as steel, petrochemical, automobile, and semiconductor 
are taking up the majority of the manufacturing sector. For this reason, despite achieving 
the world’s highest-level energy efficiency in manufacturing18), Korea’s energy intensity index 
(primary energy consumption to GPD) has stagnated for years ranking 33rd19) among OECD 
members in 2017.

Climate condition is an important factor for renewable energy production. Located in the 
mid-latitude temperate climate zone, Korea has distinct four seasons with large seasonal 
differences in the amount of solar radiation20), which complicates stable solar power supply 
all year round. In terms of wind power, it has been found that only 25% of onshore and 
40% of offshore winds are usable for power generation21). 
▍2030  GHG  reduction  target
Korea’s NDC target is to cut GHG emissions by 24.4% below 2017 level by 2030 (GHG 
emissions target by 2030 is set at 536 million tCO eq). To achieve this target, we will

implement a set of reduction strategies for the sectors including power, industry, building 
and  transportation  and  take  additional  measures  including  carbon  sinks  by  forests  and

▍Framework  Act  on  Low  Carbon  Green  Growth
Korea has enacted the Framework Act on Low Carbon Green Growth in 2010 with the 
objective of building the foundation for a low-carbon society and harnessing environmental 
technologies and green industry as a new growth engine for the national economy.
The Act prescribes the establishment and implementation of basic plans on green growth 
(National Green Growth Strategy), climate change (Basic Plan on Climate Change Response), 
and energy policies (Basic Energy Plan) on a five-year basis. These plans are required to 
be developed to meet the national GHG reduction target defined in the Enforcement Decree 
of the Act23).
The  Presidential  Committee  on  Green  Growth24)  composed  of  government  officials  and 
private experts deliberates and decides the polices to cope with climate change and energy

▍Emissions  Trading  Scheme
The  emissions  trading  scheme  (ETS)  is  a  market-based  mitigation  tool  in  which  the 
government allocates GHG emissions allowances (emissions cap) to businesses and have 
them trade the allowances freely in the market to dispose of the surplus or make up the 
deficit in their allocated allowances. An increasing number of economies are opting for this 
cost-effective25)  GHG  reduction  scheme  using  the  market  mechanism  including  the  EU, 
Switzerland, and New Zealand. 
In 2012, Korea enacted the Act on the Allocation and Trading of Greenhouse Gas Emission 
Permits which made the legal basis for the Korean ETS (K-ETS). Following a pilot stage, 
the Phase 1 of the K-ETS (2015-2017) was carried out having 252 enterprises26) subject 
to the scheme.
After setting up the emissions cap in line with the national GHG reduction targets, the 
ratio of free allocation and auctioning is determined in consideration of characteristics of 
each  business  type.  The  allocation  takes  either  grandfathering  (GF)27)  or  benchmarking 
(BM)28) method. 
25) The ETS incurs 44-68% lower cost than non-market based approaches, i.e., direct regulations on emissions (Samsung Economic 
Research Institute, 2009) 
26) Enterprises emitting over 125,000 tCO2eq/year or owning a plant that emits over 25,000 tCO2eq/year.  
27) Grandfathering method allocates allowances based on individual installations’ historical emissions levels, making simple allocation 
possible. However, the method has been criticized for not being able to take into account emissions reduction efficiencies and 
resulting in more allowances allocated to large-emitters. 
28) Benchmarking method allocates allowances based on emissions intensity of individual installations of the same business type. 
With this method, more allowances are allocated to installations with lower emissions as long as the installations’ production 
outputs are the same.  
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 372050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
During the Phase 1, all companies under the scheme were given allowances free of charge, 
and only three types of business were subject to BM-based allocation. Auctioning has come 
into play from the Phase 2 (2018-2020) targeting selected business categories, and BM 
application has also been extended to seven business types.
To ensure a high-level of flexibility in the carbon market, external credits are recognized 
and auctioning is operated on a regular basis. The allowances were traded at around KRW 
8,000 during the early stage of the K-ETS, but the price has gradually increased up to 
KRW 20,000 as of October 2020.
[Figure 2-4] Carbon price trend
In preparation for the beginning of NDC implementation under the Paris Agreement from 
2021, the Phase 3 Allocation Plan (2021–2025) was prepared in December 2019 with the 
aim of contributing to the achievement of the 2030 national GHG reduction target. The 
key elements of the Basic Plan are as in the Table 2-5.
<Table 2-5> Work plan of Phase 3 K-ETS
∙ Set the total emissions target in accordance with the 2030 national GHG 
emissions target in the NDC
Allocation ∙ Increase the share of auctioning to 10% and raise the number of business types

▍GHG  target  management  system
The  Target  Management  System  (TMS)  is  a  direct  regulation  program  managing  the 
emissions from the small- and medium-sized enterprises whose emissions are relatively 
lower and not covered by the K-ETS. A company subject to the TMS are required to make 
voluntary efforts not to exceed a cap of GHG emissions or energy consumption which has 
been set by the Government in consultation with the company. If a company fails to achieve 
the target, it will be given an improvement order or subject to penalty. 
Since first introduced in 2010, the emissions and energy consumption levels above which 
businesses are subject to the TMS have been lowered three times. The current thresholds 
for an entity and a business site are, based on latest   three-year average GHG emissions, 
50,000  tons  CO eq(energy  consumption  of  200TJ)  and  15,000  tons  CO eq  (energy

3.2 Mitigation  policy  measures
▍Transition  to  green  energy
Since the launch of the Moon Jae-in administration, Korea has been spurring the energy 
transition  by  reducing  coal  and  increasing  renewables  in  its  energy  portfolio.  The 
Government decided to suspend the construction of new coal-fired power stations and shut 
down 14 coal power plants which are 30-year old or older. (Four plants have permanently 
ceased operation to date.) The 9th Basic Plan for Power Supply and Demand that contains 
further actions to shut down additional coal-fired power plants has been established to 
achieve the NDC.
We have also made considerable progress in switching to renewable energy sources. The 
Renewable  Energy  3020  Plan  (RE  3020)  envisions  producing  20%  of  electricity  from 
renewables by 2030 while the 3rd Basic Energy Plan aims at a 30-35% by 2040.
Policy approaches to stimulate the energy transition have been diversified as well. Korea 
introduced the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) scheme in 2012 and has kept raising 
the mandatory renewable share in an incremental manner (from 5% in 2018 to 10% in 
2022). A Feed-in-Tariff (FIT)-based subsidy program is also in operation on a temporary 
basis to ensure a stable level of profits for small-scale power producers. Taking such policy 
actions have contributed to raising renewable capacity 1.6-fold and the share of renewables 
in the energy mix from 4.7% to 8.3% (including waste-to-energy) for the recent five years 
(2014-2018).

▍Industry  sector
Since 1990, the Korean economy has quadrupled in scale due mainly to the growth in 
manufacturing  sector  which  is  also  responsible  for  a  significant  portion  of  total  GHG 
40 | Chapter 2 Korea’s Climate Policies
emissions. In fact, the growth in manufacturing sector has been contributing to the constant 
increase in GHG emissions.
The two key policy tools for keeping the emissions from industry sector under control and 
helping to achieve its 2030 sectoral target are ETS and TMS. The ETS, in particular, helps 
businesses reduce GHG emissions in a cost-effective way by motivating them in the economic 
sense.

Enhancing energy efficiency is another strategic focus in cutting GHG emissions from the  rea
's
industry  sector.  The  Energy  Saving  Company  (ESCO)  program  launched  in  1993  has   ClimChap

Enterprises that consume large amount of energy (over 2,000 TOE per year) are required 
to undergo regular energy performance assessments to improve energy efficiency in their 
business operation by avoiding preventable energy loss. Since introduced in 2007, 6,406 
business sites have gone through the energy assessments by which they could save 5,675 
thousand TOE/year of energy and reduce 13,737,000 tCO eq of GHG emissions to date.

The Energy Efficiency Resource Standard (EERS) program requires energy producers to 
meet an energy saving target set up based on the volume of their energy sales. Pilot projects 
of EERS have been conducted in Korea since 2018. New projects are also under development 
to encourage end-use energy consumers to improve their energy efficiency.
▍Transportation  sector
Forced  by  increasingly  stringent  regulatory  standards  to  control  vehicle  emissions  and 
accelerated by technology innovations from the Fourth Industrial Revolution (also known 
as Industry 4.0), the global automotive industry in the 21st century is rapidly becoming 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 412050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
green, smart, and service-oriented. As one of the world’s major car manufacturing countries, 
Korea is striving to be agile in responding to future demand and cutting GHG emissions 
from the transportation sector.
Aiming at the world’s most competitive future mobility industry by 2030, we are intensively 
investing in technology innovations in green vehicle production while coming up with various 
incentive  programs  to  boost  domestic  demands  for  eco-friendly  vehicles.  The 
environment-friendly vehicle deployment target scheme requires automakers to produce and 
sell a certain percentage (15% in 2020) of eco-friendly vehicles of their new car sales. From 
2020, the public sector can purchase eco-friendly vehicles only.
We are providing eco-friendly vehicle subsidies for different type of vehicles ranging from 
passenger cars, to buses, trucks, and two-wheelers. The Government is focusing on building 
necessary infrastructure to ensure EV drivers could easily find charging stations available 
nationwide. 
Implementing  such  programs  has  contributed  to  a  surge  in  accumulated  number  of 
eco-friendly vehicles which has quadrupled for the latest 3 years. We deployed the largest 
fleet of hydrogen vehicles in 2019 and was ranked 8th in the world in terms of the number 
of registered EVs (cumulative).

In  2007,  Korea  introduced  a  requirement  of  renewable  fuel  (biodiesel)  content  in 
transportation  fuel  (diesel)  at  a  certain  rate.  Produced  mainly  from  waste  cooking  oil, 
biodiesel is a green alternative fuel that contributes to preventing environmental pollution 
as well as reducing GHG emissions. The mandatory biodiesel content has been raised from 
0.5% in 2007 to current 3%.
On  the  freight  system,  we  are  promoting  a  modal  shift  from  road  to  lower  emissions 
alternatives such as railway and marine transport. Various measures to cut emissions from 
freight transportation are in place targeting rail, shipping, and aviation industry, for example, 
by  introducing  LNG-fueled  ships  and  expanding  shore-side  electricity  in  the  marine 
transport.

▍Building  sector
The amount and patterns of GHG emissions from the building sector are largely affected 
by countries’ residential conditions and people’s lifestyle. Current mitigation polices in the 
building sector in Korea focus on saving energy consumption in apartment buildings, the 
most common housing type in Korea, and enhancing energy efficiency in lighting and home 
appliances.

1.  Korea’s  2050  Vision
The Republic  of  Korea moves towards  the  goal  of  carbon neutrality by 2050. 
The Korean New Deal will serve as a stepping stone to reach carbon neutrality by 
2050. Korea will harness green innovations and advanced digital technologies to create 
synergies between the Green New Deal and the Digital New Deal, the two pillars of 
the Korean New Deal. Korea will also take decisive action especially in supporting and 
investing  in  the  development  of  innovative  climate  technologies  to  achieve  carbon 
neutrality by 2050. 
Tackling climate change requires global efforts and collective engagement. Korea will 
lead by example to help the international community jointly make efforts to reach 
carbon  neutrality  by  2050.
2.  Principles
▍Contributing  to  global  climate  action
As a party to the Paris Agreement and a responsible member of the international community, 
Korea will faithfully join and contribute to the global efforts to hold the increase in the 
global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts 
to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
Efforts to reduce GHG emissions will provide an opportunity for sustainable development. 
We are keen to pursue joint efforts with other countries in taking robust climate action 
and supporting developing countries by sharing our innovative technologies and know-hows.
▍Laying  the  foundation  for  sustainable  and  carbon-neutral  society 
Korea will strive to build capacity to lead the ongoing paradigm shift in the global energy 
system. Our ultimate goal is to overcome resource scarcity and energy dependence and build 
a sustainable and carbon-neutral economy. 
46 | Chapter 3 Korea’s 2050 Vision
The first step towards the goal is to phase out the use of fossil fuel, which requires a major 
overhaul of the current power mix. To put in place a green, zero-emissions power supply 
system, we will significantly reduce coal power generation while increasing energy efficiency 
in  industry,  buildings  and  transportation  sector  up  to  the  level  of  the  world’s  leading 
countries. 
To create a sustainable environment for industrial development, we will foster future growth 
engines by harnessing technological innovations and decarbonizing our industry structure. 
The Government is closely collaborating with businesses and industries to promote digital 
transformation in all sectors, which will lay the groundwork for optimal use of energy and 
application of future technologies including hydrogen production/supply/use and Carbon 
Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS). 
To ensure a just transition towards carbon-neutral society, especially for those working in 
K
industries depending on fossil fuels, the Government will create new job opportunities in  ore
a
'sC
new, alternative industries and provide re-training support for them. The Government will   205hapte
also provide support to build low-carbon infrastructure in fossil fuel-dependent communities  0 Vr 3
is
io
that are likely to face job losses in the process of energy transition.  n
Moving away from the fossil-fuel based production, distribution and consumption patterns, 
we will create a circular cycle of resources that will ultimately enable people to achieve 
universal  goals  for  environment  and  health.  Meanwhile,  nature-based  carbon  sinks,  i.e. 
forests, wetlands and marine ecosystems, are to be continuously expanded to accelerate 
the transition to a carbon-neutral society. 
▍Action  at  all  levels
Given Korea’s current economic structure and industrial portfolio, moving away from the 
fossil fuel-based economy requires a sweeping change in its entire system. Balancing between 
emissions reduction and industrial growth means that all sectors including the basic patterns 
of people’s daily lives should be reshaped. 
This transformative change could take place only when a broad consensus is reached among 
various stakeholders of our society from industry, civil society and academia. In particular, 
public support and engagement are essential. It is absolutely imperative that the public 
recognizes decarbonization as the only way forward. Greater public recognition will build 
up a momentum for accelerating the action for carbon-neutral transition.
The  Government  will  inform  the  people  of  the  detailed  costs  to  be  incurred  from  this 
transition as well as the benefits of climate action in an open, transparent manner. Parting 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 472050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
from the fossil fuel economy, which has been the basis of Korea’s growth for the past decades, 
is certainly a challenging and arduous process. The Government is ready to lead this process 
by sharing information with the people on gains and losses of this transition and seek their 
consent. The costs should be borne in a fair and equitable manner by all members of society 
depending on their roles and responsibilities. 
Policymaking  for  climate  change  response  should  be  a  participatory,  democratic  and 
inclusive decision-making process that engages all and leaves no one behind. 
3.  Key  elements  of  the  2050  Vision
▍Key  element  1:  Expanding  the  use  of  clean  power  and  hydrogen  across  all 
sectors
In  achieving  the  2050  Vision,  the  most  important  key  element  is  accelerated  energy 
transition towards carbon neutrality. Solar, wind, hydro, and other types of renewable energy 
should be the central sources of energy supply. CCUS technologies should be employed in 
the  use  of  coal  and  other  fossil  fuel-powered  energy  and  LNG  power  generation  to 
significantly cut down on GHG emissions in the long-term. 
Evidently,  it  is  important  to  reorient  the  existing  energy  supply  system.  Technological 
innovation could help bring about this fundamental change by making renewable energy 
more  affordable.  Continued  efforts are  needed  to  bolster market-based  policies  such  as 
carbon pricing and to advance the power system at the national level. The intermittency 
issue remains a challenge for some renewable energy sources, which should be addressed 
considering Korea’s geographical difficulty of supplying electricity from overseas. As the 
percentage of renewable energy in the power mix gradually increases, it is essential to keep 
the electricity output predictable and reliable throughout the entire power grid. 
A system-wide integration of EVs, ESS and hydrogen technologies is another viable option, 
which could be achieved by utilizing advanced ICT and Industry 4.0 technologies. With 
this, consumers will be able to communicate with each other and trade the electricity they 
produced from distributed power sources on a smart grid. This will change the traditional 
concept of consumers into “prosumers,” who both produce and consume energy.
Most sectors of our society – transportations, cooling and heating systems and industrial 
processes – that are using fossil fuels need to use clean electricity in the future. 
48 | Chapter 3 Korea’s 2050 Vision
To achieve Korea’s 2050 Vision, most of the current means of transportation running on 
fossil fuels should be replaced with alternative modes of transport powered by electricity, 
hydrogen and other clean energy sources.
These gradual changes will form a dominant trend by 2050 especially in road transportation. 
By 2050, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles are expected to become widely popular, 
and other modes of transportation including air, sea and rail could also experience a similar 
transition. 
▍Key  element  2:  Improving  energy  efficiency  to  a  significant  level
“Energy  efficiency”  is  by  far  the  most  eco-friendly  and  economical  energy  resource30). 
Improving energy efficiency saves costs for businesses, making them more competitive in 
the market. With this enhanced competitiveness, companies could produce highly-efficient 
K
o
products,  which  ultimately  contributes  to  the  overall  industrial  growth.  It  is  a  highly  rea
'sC
economical strategy that could also help reduce energy consumption. In the absence of   205hapte
0 Vr 3
natural resources31), improving energy efficiency is one of the most essential strategies for  is
io
n
Korea, especially in relation to its energy security. 
 Once energy efficiency is improved, it will ultimately lead to a decreased energy supply. 
Compared  with  the  huge  upfront  cost  of  developing  ESS  and  hydrogen  technologies, 
improving energy efficiency is the most cost-effective option that should be considered as 
a policy instrument. 
 There  are  a  number  of  time-tested  solutions  that  are  effective  in  improving  energy 
efficiency:  enhancing  vehicle  fuel  efficiency,  strengthening  building  insulation,  using 
highly-efficient  appliances  and  deploying  a  smart  energy  management  system.  These 
solutions are already in use or readily available for all sectors from the government to 
industry to the public. 
The Government’s clear policy vision for improved energy efficiency along with balanced 
regulations and incentives will encourage active engagement and efforts from all sectors 
and ultimately help achieve a significantly improved energy efficiency. 
30) The International Energy Agency estimated that improvements in energy efficiency to be the most effective policy tool for mitigation 
in 2017.
31) As of 2017 the amount of imported energy was USD 109.5 billion, accounting for 22.9% of Korea’s total import amount. 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 492050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
▍Key  element  3:  Commercial  deployment  of  carbon  removal  and  other  future 
technologies
Korea’s manufacturing sector is largely dominated by energy-intensive industries such as 
steelmaking, cement and petrochemical production. Such an industrial structure makes it 
all  the  more  urgent  for  Korea  to  further  develop  and  commercially  deploy  future 
technologies,  i.e.,  hydrogen  technologies,  CCUS,  etc.,  to  trigger  the  transition  from 
low-carbon society into a carbon-neutral one. 
The application of such technologies is especially important because Korea’s major industries 
produce a high level of CO  emissions during their manufacturing process: manufacturing 
2
of  cokes  (reducing  agent  for  steelmaking);  calcination  of  limestone  (major  feedstock  of 
cement production); and thermal cracking of naphtha (used in petrochemicals production). 
▍Key  element  4:  Scaling  up  the  circular  economy  to  improve  industrial 
sustainability
In a linear economy, raw materials are extracted to make products and after consuming 
the products, they are thrown away. In a circular economy, however, materials are reused 
and products are recycled over and over in a circular cycle that promotes sustainability. 
Transition to a circular economy is a strategy that will help us reduce GHG emissions while 
conserving our ecosystems. Lifecyle approach is the key to ensuring product recyclability 
throughout production, consumption, recycling, and disposal, which minimizes the resource 
and  energy  inputs.  Reliance  on  new  future  technologies  could  increase  uncertainties  in 
achieving emissions reduction targets, but a stronger circular economy could reduce such 
reliance, having an effect of lowering the uncertainties. 
▍Key  element  5:  Enhancing  carbon  sinks 
Land, forests, and marine ecosystems are the fundamental elements of the environment 
and they provide a variety of goods, foods  and ecosystem services essential for human 
survival. They also function as strong carbon sinks that absorb and store CO , playing an 
2
important role in the transition towards a carbon-neutral society. Expanding and managing 
the forests with high carbon storage capacity, practicing sustainable forest management and 
promoting the use of wood products greatly contribute to reducing GHG emissions.

1.  Energy  supply
1.1 Status
▍Power  mix
As of 2017, Korea imported 94% of its energy supply from overseas and was ranked as 
9th  largest energy consumer in the world. Our rapid economic growth in the past half a 
century was possible thanks to the Government’s policy drive to foster the manufacturing 
sector. Reliable power supply was essential as our focus was on investing in manufacturing 
and increasing export.  
Korea’s electricity policy has been largely focused on increasing the supply volume by using 
coal and nuclear power as two main sources of baseload power due to their relative reliability 
and affordability. Of the total generated electricity in 2017, 43.1% was from coal while 26.8% 
was produced by nuclear power. When combined, the two power sources produced 70% 
of the total power supply. In the early 2000s, nuclear power took up 40% of the total power 
mix,  but  the  percentage  has  been  in  decline  since  then,  as  coal  and  LNG  have  been 
continuously taking up an increasing share. 
The share of electricity in end-use energy is also increasing sharply. In 1990, the percentage 
of electricity was only 10.9% of the total end-use energy, but climbed up to 19.2% in 2010. 
As more sectors and energy uses are experiencing electrification, this upward trend is likely 
to continue.

54 | Chapter 4 Visions and Strategies by Sector
▍Power  demand  by  purpose  of  use
Power consumption had been on the steady rise until its peak at 526 TWh in 2018. However, 
considering that the annual average growth rate of power consumption for the recent five 
years (2014-2018) has been halved from that of the previous five years (2009-2013), the 
power consumption growth is on a slowing trend.
Power demand by sector in figure 4-2 shows that industrial use accounts for more than 
50%, but the percentage has been declining after reaching its peak of 55.4% in 2014.
On the contrast, electricity consumed by both commercial buildings and homes is on the 
rise and the power demand in the transportation sector is also expected to grow as an 
increasing number of EVs will be deployed.

Emissions from the power sector are steadily increasing due to rising power demand and  r
deteriorating sectoral emissions intensity, but since 2010, the emissions growth in the sector 
has been slowing down. In 2017, the emissions from the power sector increased by 6-fold 
from 1990 level, accounting for 36% of Korea’s total emissions. 
[Figure 4-3] Trend of emissions by power source
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 552050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
1.2 Energy  sector’s  vision
Producing zero-emissions electricity in an eco-friendly way and using clean power in greater 
scope are the keys to achieving the Korea’s 2050 Vision. To this end, low-carbon energy 
should serve as the primary power source in energy portfolio and advanced technologies 
such as CCUS should be fully harnessed to ultimately achieve carbon neutrality of the power 
sector. 
Reducing GHG emissions in the power sector can be achieved by two different approaches: 
i) by improving emissions intensity in power production; ii) by managing power demand. 
This section mainly focuses on the power sector’s strategies to improve emissions intensity 
while strategies and tasks of managing power demand will be detailed in later sections of 
this chapter. 
The power sector plays a key role in achieving Korea’s NDC and its 2030 emissions reduction 
target as well as the 2050 carbon neutrality. To this end, deployment of innovative renewable 
energy and fossil fuels with CCUS are the two essential elements that should be secured. 
The existing power system should be changed into a renewable-based system, i.e. wind and 
solar. Fossil fuel-based power generation will no longer be a main contributor to baseload 
power, but remain as a supplementing power source for intermittent renewable energy. 
Applying CCUS to fossil fuel-based power plants must be considered to this end. 
For carbon neutrality in non-power sector, the production of clean electricity and hydrogen 
should be increased, and accordingly, power demand is expected to rise as well. Considering 
this rising power demand, a more reliable power supply system needs to be developed in 
conjunction with effective demand management. 
▍Renewable  energy-oriented  power  supply
For the 2050 carbon neutrality in the power sector, renewables, i.e., wind and solar and 
other clean renewable energy sources should become dominating power sources by 2050. 
In 2010, renewable energy accounted for only 1.2% of the annual power output, but it has 
soared up by 3.5-fold to 4.2% in 2018 (not including waste-to-energy). This rapid growth 
was possible due to the Government’s variety of policy supports including setting renewable 
energy production target at 20% by 2030, introduction of the Renewable Portfolio Standard 
(RPS) and Korean-type Feed-in Tariffs (FIT) systems.
56 | Chapter 4 Visions and Strategies by Sector
In the 3rd Basic Energy Plan formulated in May 2019, the Moon Jae-in administration has 
announced an ambitious goal of producing 35% of electricity from renewable energy sources 
by  2040.  By  2050,  this  trend  of  energy  transition  is  expected  to  accelerate,  making 
renewables the most critical power source in Korea. Continued technology development will 
lower the production cost of renewable energy. This, along with enhanced power system 
flexibility, will help build up momentum for the energy transition. 
In fact, investment cost for solar power dropped from KRW 3,745,000/kW in 2011 to KRW 
1,648,000/kW  in  2017.  For  wind  power,  the  investment  cost  decreased  from  KRW 
2,576,000/kW in 2012 to KRW 2,102,000/kW in 2017. This trend of decreasing investment 
costs for renewable energy is likely to continue in the years to come. A study by the Korea 
Energy Economics Institute suggests that the production costs of solar and wind power, 
currently higher than those of fossil fuel power, will become comparable to those of coal, 
LNG  and  other  fossil  fuels  by  203032).  After  2030,  renewable  energy  will  become  an 
economically viable option due to its cost-competitiveness with its increased deployment.

▍Fuel  cell  and  green  hydrogen
Korea considers hydrogen as an important future power source in accelerating industrial 
innovation and reducing GHG emissions. To fully harness this critical power source, we 
have announced in 2019 the Roadmap to Promote Hydrogen-based Economy, setting a path 
to move forward as a leader in this area.
The purpose of the roadmap is to build a foundation for producing green hydrogen by 
utilizing renewable energy sources, and using the produced hydrogen in fuel cells as well 
as in mobility of various forms. The roadmap aims to drive a paradigm shift from the existing

carbon-based system into a hydrogen-oriented, eco-friendly energy system. The Government 
has developed a plan to build up a fuel cell facility to generate 8GW of electricity by 2040 
and will continue to scale up the production of fuel cells. A variety of policies are to be 
put in place to expand the supply of green hydrogen as well.

Source Roadmap to promote hydrogen-based economy (2019)
▍Fossil  fuels  with  CCUS
To continue to use fossil fuel as a power source, the use of CCUS technology is critical. 
Coal and LNG power plants could continue to play an important role in solving renewable 
energy’s volatility issue and enhancing energy security if their CO  emissions are captured 
2
before they are released into the air. We will continue to move ahead with strong policies 
to  phase  out  coal  power  generation,  which  is  one  of  the  Moon  Jae-in  administration’s 
national priorities, and as a result, a significant reduction of GHG emissions from coal-fired 
power plants is expected by 2050.
Natural gas power generation will continue to play a bridging role while the current energy 
system re-aligns around renewable energy. LNG will remain as an important power source 
in Korea’s effort to enhance its readiness for unusually high peak demands and diversify 
power sources to strengthen its national energy security. 
CCUS  is  an  essential  option  to  reduce  CO   emissions  and  achieve  our  NDC  and  2030 
2
emissions  reduction  target.  Government-funded  R&Ds  are  underway  to  build  an 
infrastructure  for  developing  and  demonstrating technologies  that  can  reduce nearly 10 
million  tCO eq  by  2030.  For  a  wider  use  of  CCUS  technology,  further  technology 
2
development is needed to achieve carbon neutrality of the power sector. However, expansion 
of CCUS technology requires: i) technological advancement and subsequent cost reduction; 
ii)  large-capacity  storage  facilities  and  their  social  acceptance;  and  iii)  market-based 
incentives balanced with regulatory approaches. 
58 | Chapter 4 Visions and Strategies by Sector
Assuming the level of CCUS technology is fully matured to an advanced level and its wider 
application is realized, the technology is expected to be applied to CO  emissions from coal 
2
as well as natural gas power generation. 
1.3 Energy  supply  sector  strategies
▍Addressing  technological  limits  in  renewables
Solar and wind energy is supplied from natural energy sources that are endlessly available. 
Once a renewable energy facility is constructed, in addition to the benefit of zero-emissions, 
almost no marginal cost is incurred. In other words, renewables are eco-friendly solutions 
that provide humans with clean and endless energy source. 
However, for renewables to completely replace conventional power sources – coal, nuclear 
and natural gas – that have been proved to be reliable, and to become a main power source, 
two limitations of volatility and intermittency should be addressed in advance. Advanced 
ICT  networks,  Industry  4.0,  innovative  ESS,  and  hydrogen  as  a  fuel  will  significantly 
contribute to addressing such limitations and making energy transition possible. To solve  Vis
io
n
the volatility and intermittency problems, it is critical to: i) enhance predictability of the  s 
a
n
d
power output; and ii) build up a reliable and flexible power backup system.  StraChap
tete
First, to enhance predictability of the power output from renewables, an accurate prediction  gier 4
s
 
should be made possible with comprehensive assessment of various factors – Korea’ climate  by
 
S
e
conditions, types of renewable energy, and facility locations and scales. Second, a flexible  cto
r
real-time operation system should be introduced in the power market. Current power market 
system in Korea determines daily power output a day before the power is produced, and 
does not allow for a flexible operation. To ensure a flexible and reliable power grid operation, 
advanced control technologies and ESS should be adopted. 
In Korea, a series of effective solutions including integrated control system and real-time 
power  market  system  are  currently  being  developed33)  to  address  the  volatility  issue  of 
renewable energy. It is also important to diversify energy sources and utilize ESS for stable 
management of intermittency and peak demand issues of renewables. Fuel cells using green 
hydrogen,  ESS  and  pumped-storage  hydropower  will  provide  optimal  technological  and 
environmental  solutions  to  store  the  surplus  power  generated  from  renewables  while 
addressing intermittency issue. Fossil fuel-based power plants with CCUS could also serve 
as a crucial power backup facility for intermittent renewable energy sources. 
33) The 8th Basic Plan for Power Supply and Demand (Dec. 2017), the 3rd Basic Energy Plan (May 2019)
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 592050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
▍Building  enabling  environment  for  renewables
Conventional fossil fuel-based power grid was operated in a centralized, one-way energy 
supply system. This system was focused on facilitating the operations of large-scale power 
generation using coal and nuclear, which in the end resulted in many large power plants 
densely located in specific areas. This has caused a geographical mismatch between power 
supply and demand and subsequently, long-distance transmission grids have caused various 
social conflicts. 
Renewable  energy-oriented  power  system  will  allow  for  an  opportunity  to  solve  such 
problems of the existing centralized power system. There is no limited scope in generating 
power from renewable energy because anyone can participate in production at any scale. 
Our  strategy  is  to  move  away  from  centralized,  one-way  system,  and  change  into  a 
decentralized, participatory and multi-way grid system. 
For  instance,  anyone  could  install  solar  panels  on  top  of  buildings,  lands,  and 
transportations.  Wind  power  already  has  various  business  models  where  local  towns, 
cooperatives and residents could participate in power production and share profits. New 
business models using Distributed Energy Resources (DER) are expected to contribute to 
the  proliferation  of  renewable  energy  as  well.  Volt-to-grid  system  using  EV  batteries, 
peer-to-peer trading of excess renewable energy, and ESS could all be connected to a virtual 
power plant, which acts as an intermediary between these small-scale DER and electricity 
markets.
This transformation indicates energy consumers and producers are not separate concepts 
anymore. Prosumers who not only consume but also produce energy will soon become a 
universal concept. The Government will move in step with this trend and focus on developing 
the systems for various DER. 
[Figure 4-6] Vision for new energy supply system
60 | Chapter 4 Visions and Strategies by Sector
The Government is well-positioned to lead such transformation in time in the era of energy 
transition and create an enabling environment for renewable energy. Already, proliferation 
of distributed, participatory power sources is one of the Korea’s top policy visions. The 
Government has set the goal of increasing the power generated from DER up to 30% by 
2040.  Policies  to  improve  existing  electricity  markets  and  grid  systems  are  now  in 
development to facilitate market trading of various DER and their connections to grids. 
Deployment of smart grids is also another important task to be undertaken in order to 
secure demand flexibility. Power supply efficiency can be maximized if supply is matched 
with  demand.  Smart  metering  that  implements  time-of-use  or  season-of-use  pricing,  or 
Demand Response (DR) are the prime examples of mechanisms designed to match demand 
with supply. 
These  policies  seek  to  adjust  power  demand  by  providing  consumers  with  economic 
incentives to control their consumption. This not only reduces peak loads but also allows 
power producers to secure reliability and affordability in supplying power. This win-win 
policy models ultimately aim to build up a smart grid system which is under development 
as part of demonstration projects in many cities of Korea including Jeju Island, followed 
by Seoul and Gwangju.

▍Korean’s  economic  structure
In 2017 Korea’s GDP recorded a high annual average growth rate of 5% compared to 1990 
level (OECD annual average growth rate was 4.4%). This high growth rate is attributable 
to the growth in industry sector, which accounts for 90% of the total GDP. Manufacturing 
sector34) accounted for 39% of Korea’s GDP as of 2017, representing a smaller share than 
the service sector which took up 60%. However, industry sector’s growth rate of added 
value35) was estimated to be higher than that of the service sector. This is due to Korea’s 
focus  on  manufacturing  –  steelmaking,  shipbuilding,  automotive,  petrochemicals  and 
semiconductors production – as the national industrial base with its export-oriented growth 
strategy. 
[Figure 4-8] Change in Korea’s economic structure

increased from 32% in 1990 to 62% in 2017 while steelmaking, petrochemicals production 
and other energy-intensive sub-sectors saw their rates decrease from 68% to 38% during 
the same period. This was due to the restructuring in the manufacturing sector that has 
taken place during this period. The Government policy from the 1960s to the 1980s focused 
mainly on input-driven growth strategy and large-scale process industry, i.e. steelmaking, 
petrochemical and cement manufacturing. However, with technological advancement and 
growth  of  machinery  industry  in  the  1990s,  semiconductors,  electronics,  automotive, 
shipbuilding  and  other  technology-intensive  sub-sectors  started  to  emerge  as  flagship 
industries. Since the 2000s, knowledge-based economy and ICT have become main drivers 
for growth and as a result, semiconductors, display panels and IT industries are playing 
a key role for Korea’s economic growth.

▍Industry  sector  emissions
As of 2017, industry sector contributed 37% of Korea’s total GHG emissions (54% if indirect 
emissions were included), the rate on a par with the power sector’s emissions, both of which 
are the highest rates of all the sectors listed under this chapter. There are two main sources 
of emissions from industry sector: i) emissions from fuel combustion, i.e. coal, petroleum, 
and gas, and ii) emissions from industrial processes. The emissions from fuel combustion 
take up a majority share of the total emissions. 
As of 2017, emissions from energy use accounted for 86% while emissions from industrial 
processes recorded 14%. The trend for the past decade indicates that average annual direct 
emissions  from  energy  use  (not  including  indirect  emissions  from  electricity  use)  have 
increased by 2.0% while average annual emissions from industrial processes have risen only 
0.5%.

[Figure 4-10] Industry sector emissions
The figure 4-11 shows us the energy consumption by source in the industry sector. It indicates 
that 70% of energy use in industry sector consists of petroleum and coal, which suggests 
naphtha and cokes used in energy-intensive sub-sectors such as petrochemicals production 
and  steelmaking  have  caused  high  emissions.  Therefore,  low-carbon  transition  in  such 
energy-intensive sub-sectors is most urgently needed. 
[Figure 4-11] Industry energy consumption by source
The figure 4-12 displays how much energy has been consumed by different types of industry 
facilities37). The estimates suggest energy consumed by boilers has increased from 22% in 
2010 to 29% in 2017 while energy consumption from furnaces has declined from 20% to 
37) The value does not include the amount of naphtha and cokes used in industrial processes.

27% during the same period. This is mainly due to the increase in the number of facilities 
that needed direct heating.

GHG emissions reduction will provide more opportunities for growth for the industry sector 
and enhance the sector’s sustainability. Those opportunities will include improved energy 
efficiency and enhanced international competitiveness. 
Industry sector has many options to reduce its GHG emissions: improving energy efficiency, 
conversion into low-carbon fuels, applying CCUS technology and introducing innovative 
industrial processes. However, there is no silver bullet in dramatically reducing emissions 
across industries. Each industry has its own way of using energy and its emissions types 
and  technology  levels  vary.  One-size-fits-all  option  could  create  gaps  across  different 
industries and thus, a variety of mitigation options should be considered in achieving the 
industry sector’s 2050 vision.

petrochemical industry. (Energy consumption survey, Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy)
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 652050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
The industry sector’s 2050 vision presented in this section takes into account characteristics 
of industry sub-sectors, and factors in various mitigation options in consideration of their 
applicability.  Of  all  technology  options,  the  ones  that  are  already  in  industrial  use  are 
included as the industry sector’s mitigation options. Other technologies that have not been 
developed for commercial use yet, but has high potential for application in the near future, 
are also included as mitigation options. 
▍Applying  new,  future  technologies
Steelmaking,  cement  and  petrochemical  manufacturing  are  the  fundamental  industry 
sub-sectors that have strong forward and backward linkages with Korea’s key industries 
for economic growth – automotive, shipbuilding, construction and semiconductors. They are 
also energy-intensive sub-sectors that are responsible for a majority share of the industry 
sector’s total GHG emissions. 
In these sub-sectors, GHG emissions are inevitable because they are created from chemical 
reactions in burning coal, limestone and naphtha in major industrial processes. To reduce 
emissions from these processes, reducing the amount of fuel inputs has been previously 
suggested, but reducing fuel consumption alone only provides a limited solution. Without 
a  fundamental  change  in  current  industrial  processes,  it  is  challenging  to  reduce  more 
emissions. A new solution that introduces new systems utilizing a completely different set 
of chemical reactions using hydrogen-based technologies, biomass and Carbon Capture and 
Utilization (CCU) could be a valid option. 
In steelmaking, if hydrogen could be used to reduce iron instead of cokes that inevitably 
emits CO  in its blast furnace process, it could dramatically reduce GHG emissions. In fact, 
2
the  Government  and  private  sector  are  collaborating  to  develop  basic  technologies  for 
hydrogen-using CO reduction steelmaking (i.e., hydrogen direct reduction steelmaking39) 
2 
using carbon as fuel and ingredient) with an aim of demonstrating and developing the 
technologies from 2025. For a successful application of the technologies, their R&D as well 
as  clean  and  reliable  infrastructural  base  for  a  large-volume  of  hydrogen  and  energy 
production is critical. 
39) The 2nd energy technology development project is underway from 2017 to 2024 (Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, 2017)

Cement manufacturing process also needs to consider the scope and effect of applying a   a
n
d
series of mitigation technologies. Increasing the use of fly ash, slag or pozzolan-blended   StraChap
cement is one option because it could reduce the use of limestone, the main ingredient  tegieter 4

y
 
S
the production volume of cement itself and instead, increasing the use of recycled aggregate  e
c
to
concretes could be considered. r
CCUS technology could play a critical role in reducing GHG emissions from high-carbon 
industries. Steelmaking, cement and petrochemical manufacturing processes are large CO  
2
emitting sub-sectors40), and therefore, if CCUS technology is applied to these sub-sectors, 
they could prove to be more cost-effective than in other industries. 
If petrochemical sector could adopt CCU (Carbon-to-x)41) technology, it could become a 
leading technology option for the industrial  transition that will lead us towards carbon 
neutrality.  However,  CCU  technology  development  is  still  in  initial  stage  and  has  low 
economic feasibility due its high cost. Uncertainty around its commercial deployment is 
another factor that should be overcome. 
40) Steelmaking, petrochemicals and cement production sub-sectors emit 70% of the total emissions from industry sector. 
41) Petrochemical processes could use captured CO and hydrogen as a reacting material for methanol synthesis instead of thermal 
2
cracking of naphtha, to produce olefin products.

▍Improving  energy  efficiency
Improving energy efficiency is another important mitigation option in the industry sector. 
Korea has been making various policy efforts to enhance energy efficiency and has achieved 
overall progresses. However, recently energy efficiency has reached a high level, leaving 
little margin for further improvement and therefore, alternative measures to additionally 
enhance  energy  efficiency  are  needed.  In  Korea,  most  energy-intensive  facilities  in 
production processes are: boiler, furnace, dryer and motor in that order. More than 90% 
of  total  energy  consumed  by  the  entire  industry  sector  is  used  in  the  above  facilities. 
Mitigation technologies currently available for these facilities are already at mature level 
and internationally universal options, which therefore, should be considered as a priority 
in reducing emissions of the industry sector. 
Smart factories using Industry 4.0 technologies, i.e. advanced information technologies such 
as AI and IoT, are vital mitigation options for the future as well. Smart industry refers 
to the system-wide integration of planning, producing and selling processes of goods using 
advanced ICTs to ensure efficient distribution of resources and maximization of productivity 
and energy efficiency. It will not only reduce the use of energy and resources but also cut 
down on GHG emissions. Once applied, a smart factory system is estimated to reduce 7-10% 
energy use on average42). Therefore, the application of smart factory solutions needs to be 
completed in most factories and industrial complexes by 2050.

▍Brining  forward  circular  economy

if more wastes are reused and more products are produced sustainably. Much of the wastes  n

a
n
that can be reused as input materials are thrown away and if such wastes are reused, it  d

gier 4
metals, plastic wastes and used concretes are re-processed and reused as input materials. s 
b
y
 
S
e
The policy for reusing wastes as resources is a highly economical mitigation option that  cto
r
minimizes resource and fuel inputs, which also has an effect of reducing our reliance on 
future technologies. The Government will improve the infrastructure for waste collection 
and separation, and establish and tighten industry standards and targets for using recycled 
materials to encourage the reuse and recycling among businesses. 
▍Increasing  use  of  low-carbon  fuels
Replacing fossil fuels (bituminous coal, heavy oil and diesel) used in industrial processes 
with renewables (waste synthetic resin and biomass) is an option that proves to be effective 
in  reducing  emissions  and  technologically  viable.  Expanding  electrification  across  the 
industry sector, based on a carbon neutrality of the power sector, is another major option 
to be considered in achieving the industry sector’s 2050 vision. 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 692050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
However,  electrification  may  not  act  as  a mitigation  option due to  the  GHG emissions 
generated from producing electricity and the energy loss from electrification itself, and there 
are numerous industrial processes where electrification is physically impossible. Sectoral 
characteristics  and  varying  power  supply  conditions  must  be  fully  considered  when 
promoting electrification of the industry sector to achieve further GHG emissions reduction. 
▍Reducing  F-gas  from  industrial  processes
Fluorinated  gases,  or  F-gases  refer  to  HFCs,  PFCs  and  SF ,  which  are  widely  used  in 
6
refrigeration,  air-conditioning,  and  manufacturing  processes  of  heavy  electric  machines, 
semiconductors  and  display  devices.  The  industry  sector  is  the  only  source  of  F-gas 
emissions. Since 2000, the F-gas emission has increased by 32% because the use of HFCs 
has risen due to the Government restrictions on HCFCs and the rapid development of IT 
industry, especially in display panels and other electronic devices. 
To phase down both production and consumption of HFCs, international community has 
come  together  to  adopt  the  Kigali  Amendment  to  the  Montreal  Protocol.  When  the 
Amendment is ratified and comes into force in Korea, 80% reduction in HFCs will be 
required by 2045. F-gases could be either replaced with materials of lower Global Warming 
Potentials (GWPs) or destroyed in a high-temperature incinerator. In fact, these options 
are already in use to reduce refrigerants used in cooling and heating equipment of homes 
and refrigeration of vehicles. A replacement of SF , used for insulation of heavy electronic 
6
machines, is under development as well. 
Policy efforts are underway at government level to increase the recycling rate of refrigerants 
and promote their eco-friendly disposal. The Government has put in place a registration 
system for refrigerant collecting businesses. The Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
system also requires producers to properly dispose of used refrigerants in their electronic 
appliances  and  vehicles  when  these  products  are  discarded.  The  Government  plans  to 
significantly reduce F-gases emitted from electronic industry processes by expanding the 
use of heat, catalyst and plasma technologies. The Government will continue to offer policy 
support to develop highly-efficient mitigation technologies for industrial processes as well 
as alternative  materials to  F-gases.  The  Government  will  also  put  in place  institutional 
frameworks  and  incentives  to  encourage  businesses  to  establish  and  implement  their 
voluntary mitigation targets for F-gases.

2.3 Industry  sector  strategies
▍Creating  a  sustainable  industry  environment
Low-carbon transition and industry streamlining combined with advanced ICTs are the two 
main  elements  for  innovation  in  future  manufacturing  sector.  The  two  elements  will 
fundamentally change the definition and scope of conventional manufacturing which was 
based  on  producing  goods  using  fossil  fuels.  The  changed  definition  and  scope  of 
manufacturing  and  evolving  product  value  chain  will  emphasize  the  importance  of 
interlinkage and collaboration among industry sub-sectors. 
One-off options will no longer be valid, instead, sustainability will become the top priority 
in all sectors of our society. To keep up with this changing trend, low-carbon transition 
and digital transformation should be at the center of industry sector transformation and 
to  this  end,  decisive  actions  are  needed  to  promote  smart  and  inclusive  innovation  in 
manufacturing sector.
▍Boosting  investment  in  technology  innovation V

Commercial deployment of advanced future technologies is the key strategy to achieve the   a

industry sector’s 2050 vision. Joint action by the Government and businesses is needed   StraChap
tete
to boost investment in future technologies mentioned in previous sections – i.e., hydrogen  gier 4

direct reduction in steelmaking, CCUS and low-carbon fuels. It is also critical to build up  by
 
S
e
an institutional framework and infrastructure in advance to ensure timely application of  cto
r
developed technologies to industrial processes and sites. For instance, there are several 
pre-conditions to be met for a successful operation of CCUS technology: safe storage facilities 
for captured CO emissions; closely linked carbon market system; and a robust framework 
2 
for the verification of emissions reductions. 
Hydrogen direct reduction and low-carbon fuel technologies also require an energy supply 
system that has ample capacity to provide sufficient amount of hydrogen and renewable 
energy. Especially, hydrogen reduction steelmaking technology, under development in Korea 
is CO reduction technology using carbon as fuel and ingredient. Significant investments 
2 
should be made in developing such innovative technologies with the aim of decarbonizing 
the entire industry.  
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 712050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
▍Increasing  support  for  energy  efficiency  improvement
In taking regulatory measures, a balanced approach is a key strategy to create an enabling 
environment  where  businesses  are  encouraged  to  improve  their  energy  efficiency  and 
motivated to reduce their emissions. 
One  of the  most effective  mitigation options  currently  in  use is the  Emissions Trading 
Scheme (ETS). ETS should be used as a tool to incentivize corporate low-carbon activities 
such as making more investment in improving energy efficiency and reducing more GHG 
emissions, rather than as a prescriptive regulatory measure that simply controls businesses 
to purchase permits or adjust production volume. In parallel with the ETS, setting voluntary 
reduction targets for large-emitters could be another option. If their targets are met, the 
Government could give them incentives and motivate them to reduce more emissions.
The Government will continuously take measure to tighten energy efficiency standards for 
boilers,  motors,  pumps  and  other  major  equipment  while  expanding  incentives  for 
retrofitting existing facilities. Factory Energy Management System (FEMS) or the Energy 
Service Companies (ESCOs) are currently in place but needs to further expand their scopes 
and targets. Energy Efficiency Resource Standards (EERS) is to be introduced and needs 
continuous implementation.

3.  Transportation
3.1 Status
▍Modes  of  transportation
The transportation sector offers mobility to people and goods largely in four different modes: 
on-road vehicles, trains, ships and planes. All these modes of transportation mostly run 
on fossil fuels, especially on petroleum. 32% of the oil used domestically is consumed by 
the transportation sector.

The petroleum-based transportation system is certainly responsible for a large portion of 
GHG emissions, but its impact on air pollution is far more serious. In fact, as of 2016, 
NOx  and  SOx  emitted  from  the  transportation  sector  accounted  for  13%  of  the  total 
Particulate Matter (PM) emissions in Korea, which has emerged as one of the most pressing 
social issues in recent years. 
▍Emissions  by  mode  of  transportation
The transportation sector was responsible for 14% of the total GHG emissions in Korea 
in  2017.  GHG  emissions  from  the  transportation  sector  have  increased  significantly  by 
2.8-fold in 2017 from 1990 level due to increased number of vehicles43), expansion of road 
networks and expanded freight logistics. 
[Figure 4-17] Emissions trend by transportation sector (as of 2017)
The figure 4-17 indicates that the transportation sector’s emissions increase rate has been 
maintained at 4.5% on average per year until 2010, which then, has slowed down to 2.5% 
from 2012 to 2017. The increate rate has slowed down because overall fuel efficiency has 
had continuous improvement due to the introduction of GHG emissions and fuel efficiency 
standards44)  in  2010.  Volatility  in  oil  prices  has  restricted  the  fuel  use,  which  also  has 
contributed to the slowdown. 
43) The number of registered vehicles has increased by 6.6 times from 3.39 million units in 1990 to 22.53 million units in 2017 
and the cargo volume has also increased by 6 times from 336 million tons in 1990 to 2,029 million tons in 2017.

74 | Chapter 4 Visions and Strategies by Sector
Since 1990, emissions from on-road vehicles, i.e. passenger cars, trucks and buses, have 
accounted for more than 87% of total emissions from the transportation sector, and the 
percentage has increased up to 96% in 2017. Aviation and shipping are only responsible 
for a small portion of the sectoral emissions, but the aviation industry has recorded a steady 
average increase rate of 5.5% per year since 2010 while the shipping industry has seen 
annual average decrease rate of 7.3%. 
3.2 Transportation  sector’s  2050  vision
Introduction of internal combustion engine and electricity system has opened up the era 
of mass production, symbolized by the 2nd Industrial Revolution. Advancement of internal 
combustion engine has made a remarkable progress in achieving convenience and mobility 
for  people  and  goods  and  shortening  travel  time.  The  progress  has  removed  all 
distance-related obstacles in human history. 
Another paradigm shift in the transportation sector, that could be on a par with the 2nd 
V
Industrial Revolution, is now underway. This paradigm shift is led by growing demand for  isio
n
s
carbon neutrality as well as advancement of Industry 4.0 technologies. Unlike the previous   a
n
d
modal transformation that has focused on increasing convenience and shortening travel time,   StraChap
tete
eco-friendliness and smart intelligence are the two keys to the ongoing paradigm shift. This  gier 4
s
 
b
modal transformation seeks to move away from the existing petroleum-based mobility and  y
 
S
e
progress towards future mobility characterized by eco-friendly and autonomous vehicles.  cto
r
At  the  core  of  paradigm  shift  is  the  transformation  into  clean  energy  sources  with 
zero-emissions – electricity, hydrogen and biofuels – and into green mobility using such 
zero-emissions energy sources. Deploying EVs and hydrogen vehicles operating on a clean 
energy supply system is the key mitigation option in the transportation sector. 
Low-carbon transition in the transportation sector will fundamentally change the entire 
energy demand and supply system in Korea, which highly depends on imported oil. The 
transition will significantly reduce air pollutants as well, improving people’s quality of life 
and health. 
Korea will significantly reduce GHG emissions in the transportation sector from the current 
level with the main sectoral strategies of increasing deployment of eco-friendly vehicles such 
as EVs and hydrogen cars, and improving vehicle fuel efficiency. The transportation sector’s 
2050 vision presented in this section also aims to further accelerate this with four key 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 752050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
strategies: scaling up deployment of eco-friendly vehicles, increasing low-carbon fuel use, 
promoting green logistics and managing transportation demand.
▍Scaling  up  deployment  of  eco-friendly  vehicles
Electric and hydrogen vehicles are eco-friendly modes of transportation as they are powered 
by  clean  energy  sources  and  release  zero  emissions  during  operation.  Scaling  up  the 
deployment of electric- and hydrogen-powered vehicles is expected to be one of the core 
strategies for the transportation sector, with its high level of contribution to GHG emissions 
reduction. 
Korea has already set an ambitious target of deploying such clean vehicles. According to 
the target, EVs and hydrogen vehicles will account for 1/3 of new vehicle sales in 2030. 
The target aims to deploy 3 million units of EV and 0.85 million units of hydrogen vehicle 
by 2030 and when other types of hybrid vehicles are counted, the number of clean vehicles 
is likely to increase.

▍Increasing  low-carbon  fuel  use
Biofuels refer to the fuels produced by the mixture of petroleum (fossil fuel) and biomass 
(biological raw materials) such as bioethanol and biodiesel. These biofuels have a clear 
mitigation advantage because they could be readily used in existing internal combustion 
engines. Some modes of transportation are likely to experience difficulty in using electricity 
or hydrogen as fuels even in 2050, and in such cases, biofuels could serve as an effective 
mitigation option due to their low-carbon advantage.
Korea adopted the Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) for transportation fuels in 2015. The 
standards require a certain level of renewable energy sources to be mixed in transportation 
fuels, e.g. using 3% or more biodiesels for passenger vehicle diesels. The scope of RFS is 
planned to be expanded to cover gasoline, ship/jet fuel, and the minimum percentage of 
renewables is to be increased as well. However, some undermining factors with biofuels 
still remain. Production of biofuels is known to cause environmental degradation globally 
and its supply in Korea is still heavily dependent on imported biofuels. The success of scaling 
up the use of biofuels depends on addressing these factors.
▍Advancing  maritime,  aviation  and  railroad  transportation V

s
In Korea, trains are one of the most critical modes of transportation that provide mobility   a
n
d
for people and goods with low GHG emissions. Korean railroad infrastructure is already   StraChap
tete
equipped with electricity-powered system, best shown in its city subways and inter-city  gier 4
s
 
express railways. As a result, the increase rate of GHG emissions from railroad transportation  by
 
S
e
has been lower than that of passenger numbers carried by rail since the 1990s. As in other  cto
r
sectors,  advancing  the  transport  system  based  on  clean  energy  sources  (i.e.,  electricity, 
hydrogen, and biofuel) is a core mitigation strategy in aviation and shipping. 
Short-term  mitigation  strategies  include  expanding  Alternative  Maritime  Power  (AMP), 
increasing the use of biofuel- and LNG-powered ships and improving efficiency through 
economic operation. Deployment of electricity- and hydrogen-powered aircrafts and ships 
will serve as a core mitigation strategy in the longer-term. Hydrogen-powered transportation 
is one of the key pillars of Korea’s future mobility. National-level R&D is underway for 
the commercial deployment of hydrogen-powered trains, ships and drones in Korea by 2030. 
Such advanced future technologies will help achieve carbon neutrality in the transportation 
sector.

▍Managing  transportation  demand  and  optimizing  vehicle  operation
Changing  people’s  behavioral  patterns  and  improving  social  infrastructure  could  be  an 
important mitigation strategy as well. The prime example is measures to limit people’s 
driving to reduce energy consumption, and to optimize traffic operation to make energy 
consumption more efficient. 
Strategies  to  make  people  drive  less  include  improving  the  existing  mass  transit 
infrastructure, creating a walking and rideable living environment, and expanding shared 
mobility. Given that half of the entire population in Korea is living in Seoul capital area, 
policies to promote the use of public transportation in/out of the metropolitan area will 
solve the problem of traffic congestion during rush hours. Expanding car sharing service 
in remote areas without access to public transportation is likely to have a positive effect 
of controlling demand as the service is expected to reduce the number of cars owned and 
restrain driving.
Meanwhile, optimization of car operation and reduced energy consumption within existing 
road system could be achieved with the development of a Cooperative Intelligent Transport 
System45) and commercial deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Korea has already put 
in place the advanced intelligent transport system that offers users real-time information 
on road traffic demands and accidents. The system is closely connected to individual car 
navigation systems, which help drivers find optimal routes to maximize vehicle operational 
efficiency. 
AVs are another valid opportunity for reducing GHG emissions. The AV technology also 
aims to maximize car operational efficiency and improve energy efficiency as well. Policies 
for traffic demand management and optimized car operation are expected to improve energy 
efficiency, which will contribute to achieving the transportation sector’s vision by 2050. 
▍Modal  shift
Korea has the world’s leading logistics system that enables same-day deliveries of goods 
nationwide. Evolving logistics system is dynamically changing people’s consumption pattern 
from offline purchases to online shopping, and this trend will accelerate in the years to 
come. The logistics system in Korea has developed around the road transportation mainly 
using freight trucks46), which have consumed a high level of energy resulting in increased 
45) C-ITS: Cooperative Intelligent Transport System

GHG emissions and air pollution. Therefore, modal shift of freight from road to low-carbon 
alternatives such as rail and shipping is necessary to solve this problem. 
3.3 Transportation  sector  strategies
▍Building  up  infrastructure  for  clean  vehicles
The price competitiveness of eco-friendly vehicles is currently lower than that of internal 
combustion vehicles in the market, which means eco-friendly mobility is still in its early 
development stage and needs policy support to be able to compete with conventional types 
of vehicle.
Various types of policy incentives and regulations are already available in Korea designed 
to  increase  the  market  penetration  of  clean  vehicles:  subsidies  for  eco-friendly  vehicle 
purchases;  minimum  purchase  requirements  for  the  public  sector;  and  minimum  sales 
requirements for carmakers. The Government will continue to maintain these policy options 
to  provide  necessary  support  for  the  eco-friendly  vehicle  market  to  ensure  the  market  V

emissions regulation is only applied to passenger cars, vans and trucks, but medium- and  y
 
S

heavy-duty vehicles will also be subject to emissions regulation in the coming years. cto

Construction of electric- and hydrogen-fueling infrastructure is another key strategy. If users 
of  eco-friendly  vehicles  could  have  an  easy  and  convenient  access  to  EV  and 
hydrogen-charging stations nationwide, it will greatly contribute to their increased market 
penetration. The Government will continue to scale up its effort to construct the charging 
station infrastructure. In fact, a significant amount of government funding has been already 
spent  on  building  the  infrastructure:  5,936  EV  fast  charging  stations  and  34 
hydrogen-charging stations have been already built as of 2019. The Government will also 
continue to scale up its investment in these infrastructures to achieve the targets of building 
10,000 EV charging stations and 310 hydrogen-fueling stations by 2022.

by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, 2017)
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 792050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
▍Mobility  technology  innovation
Even with decisive actions to deploy eco-friendly vehicles and improve social infrastructure 
to achieve the transportation sector’s 2050 vision, there is still a long way to go to achieve 
the sector’s full decarbonization. This means continuous efforts are needed to drive down 
GHG emissions further, especially by advancing future mobility technologies. 
For instance, improved drone capabilities could reduce the demand for deliveries by freight 
trucks. Electric personal mobility vehicles such as e-scooters or e-mopeds could also play 
a significant role. Some of the future mobilities such as Urban Air Mobility47), subsonic 
capsule trains48) and hydrails are still in their infancy and therefore it is too early to predict 
their mitigation effects and technological feasibility. The Government will continue to provide 
investments in these technologies in the long-term as part of its effort to identify optimal 
solutions to reduce GHG emissions.

4.1 Status
▍Status  of  buildings
The total number of buildings in Korea recorded approximately 7 million units as of 2018 
with Gross Floor Area (GFA) of 3,754,130,000㎡. The number of units and GFA are on 
the steady rise annually. The figure 4-19 shows GFA percentages of different building types 
by their purpose of use. Of the total, residential buildings account for the largest share 
(47.2%), followed by commercial buildings (21.7%) and industrial buildings (10.7%). For 
residential buildings, apartments take up 61%, indicating apartments are the most common 
type of housing in Korea.

▍Building  sector’s  energy  consumption
The total energy consumption from the building sector continues to increase due to rising 
GFA  and  intensifying  extreme  weather  events,  i.e.  heat/cold  waves.  However,  building 
sector’s energy intensity (Energy consumption/GFA) has improved steadily49) due to the 
effects  of  the  energy  saving  programs,  mitigation  policies  and  improved  construction 
technologies and materials.  
49) Energy intensity changes: households 0.014 toe/㎡ in 2012→ 0.013 toe/㎡ in 2018, commercial and public sector 0.022 toe/㎡ 
in 2012 → 0.020 toe/㎡ in 2018
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 812050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
Energy use patterns by building types shown in the figure 4-20 indicate that the energy 
use by commercial and public buildings has been rising while energy use by households 
has been falling gradually. This is attributable to the industry restructuring that has taken 
place during the period and subsequent expansion of service industries. 
Residential and commercial buildings have different patterns of using energy sources as 
well50). Residential buildings mainly use a combination of city gas (46.5%) and electricity 
(25.9%) whereas commercial and public buildings use electricity (61.9%) as their primary 
energy source. 
[Figure 4-20] Energy use patterns in building sector
▍Building  sector  emissions
Building sector was responsible for 7% (24% if indirect emissions were included) of Korea’s 
GHG emissions as of 2017. The figure 4-21 displays the rising percentage of commercial/ 
public building emissions. In contrast, the percentage of residential building emissions has 
been declining. In 2017, emissions intensity of commercial and public buildings (including 
indirect emissions) was estimated to be 0.088 tCO eq/㎡, nearly 2.1-fold higher than that 
2
of residential buildings (0.041 tCO eq/㎡), which indicated that a greater amount of energy 
2
was used in commercial and public buildings. 
Meanwhile, there has been a surge in direct emissions from the building sector due to its 
electricity and heat use. Indirect emissions from the sector have increased by 8.8-fold from 
1990 level, while direct emissions have decreased by 25%. The sector’s indirect emissions

have risen due to the combination of several factors: increased use of electric home/office 
appliances, electrification of cooking equipment, and fuel transition for heating from oil/coal 
to electricity.

The building sector’s 2050 vision aims to lay the foundation for creating an environment 
where all people could enjoy safe and convenient living and working space and significantly 
reduce GHG emissions by rationalizing energy use in a cost-effective manner. This vision 
could be achieved by improving building insulation and air-tightness, minimizing energy 
use, promoting renewable energy production – solar, geothermal and hydro – and reducing 
fossil fuel use. Such efforts could make people’s living environments cleaner and better. 
The Government will seek to harness Industry 4.0 technologies to further improve building 
energy efficiency and increase deployment of renewables. Different energy use patterns by 
building  types  will  also  be  considered  to  reduce  significant  amount  of  GHG  emissions. 
However, city gas51) used by the building sector for heating and cooking has a nationwide 
distribution  network  of  pipelines  already  in  place,  which  makes  it  difficult  to  fully

decarbonize. Therefore, emissions reduction level from city gas will be determined when 
we  have  a  visibility  of:  the  level  of  technical  development  and  economic  feasibility  of 
alternative low-carbon energy sources (i.e., hydrogen); the possibility of deployment of such 
energy sources; and the level of electrification of equipment used in buildings. 
▍Improving  building  energy  efficiency
Minimizing energy use in buildings, i.e. maximizing building energy efficiency, and supplying 
low-carbon energy sources for buildings are the most cost-effective mitigation options. 
Strategies for improving building energy efficiency have already been implemented and seen 
remarkable progresses. The comparison between old buildings (built 30 years ago) and 
newly-built ones shows a stark contrast in the amount of heating energy used per square 
meter.  The  figure  4-22  shows  that  the  apartment  buildings  and  detached  houses  built 
recently use nearly 43% and 31% less energy compared with old ones, respectively. 
[Figure 4-22] Heating energy use by residential buildings per ㎡
Apartment buildings Detached houses
Source 2nd Basic Plan for Green Buildings (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, Dec. 2019)
The  Government  has  been  taking  different  policy  measures  for  new  and  old  buildings: 
regulatory measures for new buildings and incentives for old buildings. Newly-constructed 
buildings  are  subject  to  the  standards  and  regulations  designed  to  ultimately  phase  in 
zero-energy buildings. All public buildings (GFA of 1,000㎡ or larger) to be built from 2020 
will be required to meet the zero-energy building standards and from 2030, the standards 
will be applied to all public and private buildings (GFA of 500㎡ or larger). 
Old buildings are eligible for the government incentives if they adopt green remodeling 
solutions. Public sector is taking the lead in promoting green retrofitting and remodeling 
by conducting energy performance assessment on a regular basis. Private sector is also 
benefited with various incentives such as tax cuts and grants for interest expenses when 
adopting green remodeling solutions.
84 | Chapter 4 Visions and Strategies by Sector
Along with the improvement of energy efficiency, using low-carbon energy sources is also 
critical.  Wall-mounted  solar  panels  could  contribute  to  decarbonizing  power  generation 
within buildings. Geothermal energy, hydro power and waste heat from power generation 
and  incineration  could  replace  fossil  fuels  used  for  heating  and  cooling  of  buildings. 
Improving energy efficiency and enabling passive and active houses is the core strategy 
to achieve the building sector’s 2050 vision.

▍Deploying  highly  efficient  equipment
Scaling up the deployment of highly efficient home/office appliances and lighting equipment 
is a major mitigation strategy that can reduce energy consumption while cutting down on 
GHG emissions. Once built, buildings and houses are difficult to modify or restructure for 
a long period of time. Considering this nature of building sector, retrofitting old buildings 
and improving energy efficiency of appliances and equipment used in buildings are highly 
effective mitigation options.  
In  Korea,  primary  home  appliances  are  subject  to  the  energy  efficiency  standards  and 
labeling scheme52), which are being tightened gradually by the Government to improve their 
52) A total of 33 items (refrigerator, air-conditioner, washing machine, hot & cold water dispenser, rice cooker, LED lamp) are subject 
to the standards and scheme. 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 852050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
overall energy efficiency. Consumers are also benefited with various government incentives. 
When consumers purchase home appliances certified to be highly efficient, they are offered 
a cash rebate, amounting to a certain percentage of a product price. Lighting standards 
will  be  also  tightened  step-by-step  to  phase  out  fluorescent  lamps53)  by  2027.  The 
Government also plans to increase the market penetration of smart LED lamps  to more 
than  60%  by  2040.  Smart  LED  lamps  are  equipped  with  sensors  and  smart  controls 
providing optimal ambient lighting. With the deployment of such highly efficient appliances 
and equipment, GHG emissions from buildings could be effectively reduced. 
▍Scaling  up  deployment  of  smart  energy  management  system
Building Energy Management System (BEMS) mobilizes Internet of Things (IoT), big data 
analytics and Industry 4.0 technologies in collecting real-time information on energy use 
within buildings. The BEMS enables automatic control and optimal energy operation, leading 
to the most efficient energy use.
The BEMS deployment is being scaled up in relation to the zero- energy building standards 
while deployment of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is being promoted at the 
government level. 
4.3 Building  sector  strategies
▍Funding  support  for  green  buildings
The measures and systems mentioned in the above could have immediate effects in reducing 
GHG  emissions  from  buildings,  and  in  the  long-term,  prove  to  be  economical  and 
cost-effective as they cut down energy costs for building users. However, as retrofitting old 
buildings and putting in place energy management systems could incur high investment 
costs in the short-term, the Government’s policy support is needed in providing investment 
incentives for building owners. 
The Government is considering various policy options such as providing grants for interest 
expenses  for  the  investments  made  to  retrofit  buildings  and  expanding  tax  cuts.  The 
Government also plans to provide funding support for vulnerable populations to promote 
their welfare in relation to energy supply.

86 | Chapter 4 Visions and Strategies by Sector
▍Building  up  energy  big  data  and  promoting  their  use
In many cases building owners are not necessarily building users, who usually pay for the 
energy they consume within buildings. Building owners, therefore, lack economic motivation 
to invest more in improving building energy efficiency. 
However,  a  transparent  system  that  offers  accurate  information  on  the  building  energy 
efficiency and consumption provides opportunities to make an informed decision for those 
who are willing to purchase or lease the building. In turn, the system will ultimately motivate 
the building owners to invest more in improving their building energy efficiency. 
Furthermore, information  gap  between building  owners and users  can  be  addressed by 
making  more  energy  performance  information  accessible  when  leasing  buildings,  and 
providing a greater access to building energy big data for the private sector. To this end, 
the Government will continue to provide necessary policy supports.
▍Creating  future  smart  city
Cities with closely connected networks of big data and advanced hydrogen technologies, 
ICT and transportation system could provide numerous opportunities in achieving carbon 
neutrality of the building sector. Future smart cities tightly linked to advanced ICT are  V

5.  Waste
1.1 Status
▍Waste  generated
The waste generated in Korea in 2017 weighed 157.8 million ton, approximately 0.43 million 
ton/day, indicating 7.5% increase from 0.4 million ton/day in 2012. The increase was mainly 
due  to  the  changed  consumption  patterns  dominated  by  online  shopping  and  delivery 
services. The most notable increase during the same period was shown in plastic wastes 
from households.
Of the generated waste, 85.4% was recycled, 8.3% was landfilled and 6.1% was incinerated. 
Recycling rate for construction waste was 98.1% while 80.6% of business waste and 61.6% 
of household waste were recycled. 
[Figure 4-25] Waste generation and disposal (as of 2017)
Waste generated Disposal
▍Waste  policy
Korea has been continuously developing its waste policy frameworks to facilitate both waste 
reduction at source and recycling. Previously our waste management policy mainly focused 
on safe disposal of wastes, but with the introduction of the volume-based waste fee system 
in 1995, followed by the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) system in 2003, our policy 
focus has been shifted into waste reduction at source and recycling. 
88 | Chapter 4 Visions and Strategies by Sector
The shifted focus led to the enactment of the Framework Act on Resource Circulation in 
2018. The Act aims to improve recyclability of products by taking into account their entire 
life cycle – from production to disposal – and achieve the transition to a circular economy. 
In 2018, the 1st Basic Plan for Resource Circulation for 2018-2027 was established and since 
then, we have been implementing relevant policy measures. 
▍Waste  sector  emissions
GHG emissions from the waste sector in 2017 recorded 16.8 million tCO eq, representing 
2
2.4% of Korea’s total GHG emissions. A significant portion of the sectoral emissions (89.9%, 
equivalent to 15.1 million tCO eq) originates from landfilling and incineration. The total 
2
GHG emissions from the sector have increased by 69.7% from 1990 level. 
Methane is primarily emitted from the decomposition of organic materials in landfills and 
wastewater/sewage  treatment  facilities  while  CO   is  mainly  released  from  incineration 
2
facilities. Unlike other sectors, methane takes up 49.4%, the highest percentage of total 
emissions of the waste sector.

1.2 Waste  sector’s  2050  vision  and  strategies
Over-production and reckless consumption are the cause of waste problems, but they are 
also the cause of global resource deletion and environmental degradation that are no less 
serious than climate change. 
Therefore, it is critical to fundamentally reduce the amount of waste generated at source 
and create a virtuous cycle where resources are reused and recycled repeatedly. This could 
be achieved by maximizing resource efficiency and minimizing resource inputs throughout 
the entire product life cycle – from extraction of natural resources, to production, distribution 
and consumption of products, to recycling and disposal of waste.
The waste sector’s strategy seeks to identify ways to convert generated wastes into useful 
materials and reuse them as energy sources to the extent possible. If there are any unrecycled 
wastes left, they should be disposed of in an eco-friendly manner. The Government is also 
pushing for the phase-out of plastics, which is one of the core strategies to achieve carbon 
neutrality.  This  is  our  2050  vision  for  the  waste  sector  that  could  serve  as  the  most 
eco-friendly  and  cost-effective  mitigation  option  for  our  transition  towards  a  circular 
economy. 
▍Waste  reduction  at  source
The top priority to achieve this vision is to reduce resource inputs and waste generation 
throughout the entire life cycle of products. By doing so, we aim to achieve the decoupling 
of waste generation from economic growth. 
To this end, production flows need to be optimized by each production process to minimize 
resource inputs and  energy  losses. All  production processes must  be  streamlined  in  an 
eco-friendly way to ensure all generated by-products are reused on the site to the full extent 
possible. The business entities that consume large quantity of resources and generate large 
amount of wastes will be subject to the target management system. The system will apply 
tightened targets for reducing waste at source, increasing resource productivity and using 
recycled material inputs.
A new type of supply chain will be created with its focus on reusable packaging. The new 
supply chain aims to dramatically cut down on disposable packaging materials and promote 
the  use  of  reusable  packaging  in  B2B  and  B2C  transactions.  Once  used,  the  reusable 
packaging materials will be collected for reuse.
90 | Chapter 4 Visions and Strategies by Sector
To reduce waste generated from the consumption stage, products should be designed easy 
to repair and durable. Repair instructions should also be provided for users in more detail. 
Single-use plastics will be phased down from the stage of production to consumption. The 
Government is planning to provide local instruction services for repair, reuse and upcycling 
to minimize the amount of waste thrown away after a single use. 
▍Promoting  recycling:  creating  added  values  from  wastes
Our vision for the waste sector is that once generated, wastes should be kept in a circular 
cycle where they will be repeatedly reused and recycled to the full extent possible. This 
will allow us to reduce extraction, production and use of natural resource and energy and 
cut  down  on  incineration  and  landfilling  of  wastes.  To  achieve  the  vision,  product 
recyclability should be considered first and foremost from production stage, e.g., designing 
colorless PET bottles that are easy to recycle. The Government plans to establish design 
standards targeted for each product’s purpose of use and for each product item to enhance 
resource recyclability.
It is also imperative to make waste separation, collection and sorting more efficient to ensure 
that materials to be recycled maintain proper quality. Waste separation standards should  V
is
io
continue  to  be  tightened,  taking  into  account  changing  physical  properties  of  wastes  n

generated, driven by evolving socio-economic structure. The Government plans to scale up  d
investments in developing sorting technologies and expanding related infrastructure. The   StrateChapte
gier 4
Government will also set up an incentive-based system that offers different level of policy  s

supports depending on the quality of sorted materials.  Se
c
to
r
It is also important to build up a circular system that mandates producers to use a certain 
percentage of recycled content as input materials when manufacturing new products. To 
this end, first and foremost, the Government will work on improving the EPR system, and 
in the mid-to long-term, set mandatory percentages of recycled materials in consideration 
of  characteristics  of  different  manufacturing  types.  Public  sector  will  be  encouraged  to 
purchase recycled products and consumers will have more choices to choose from as more 
recycled products will be released on the market. A recycling cluster dedicated to large-scale 
R&D, demonstration and prototype production should also be created to foster recycling 
industries and technologies. Moreover, new types of wastes are to be generated with the 
rapid advancement of Industry 4.0 technologies and renewable energy. They should be 
managed by the public sector within a safe and reliable disposal system. The public-private 
partnerships will also be followed to build a recycling system that creates high added values 
from these new types of wastes. 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 912050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
▍Eco-friendly  disposal  of  waste
Wastes that are unrecyclable should be disposed of in the eco-friendliest manner possible 
so as to reduce GHG emissions. Currently direct landfilling is banned for food waste only, 
but combustible waste will also be banned from direct landfill disposal. Only the residues 
left from sorting and incineration will be allowed for direct landfilling. We will also set 
up  eco-friendly  landfill  standards  to  enable  low-carbon  landfill  management.  Landfill 
facilities of a certain size will be required to install methane recovery facilities to increase 
on-site energy production. 
Waste incineration will not simply be a waste-burning process, but instead act as an energy 
production base. The energy generated from incineration process will be connected to district 
heating system and hydrogen production/using sites for its full use. The Government will 
continue  to  support  the  development  of  carbon  capture  or  sequestration  technologies 
applicable to incineration process, and update the incineration facility standards to mandate 
on-site application of these carbon reduction technologies.
One of the core materials anticipated to be used in the future is bioplastics. Although the 
base for their production and use is not in place yet, bioplastics are expected to reduce 
the demand for synthetic plastics and cut down on waste generation at source. For the 
ultimate replacement of synthetic plastics with bioplastics, R&D on bioplastic technologies 
should be continuously conducted while marketing efforts to diversify their lines of products 
should be made.

farming sector, agriculture and livestock farming sectors are responsible for 88.6%, which 
mainly comes from non-energy processes such as crop cultivation and livestock farming

6.2 Farming  sector’s  2050  vision  and  strategies
Looking ahead, changing lifestyle and dietary patterns are expected to have impact on the 
food  demand.  Meat  consumption,  in  particular,  is  expected  to  grow  continuously  for  a 
considerable period. 
Most of the GHG emissions from the farming sector is attributable to the biological reactions 
taking  place  from  food  production  processes.  Therefore,  it  is  impossible  to  remove  the 
sector’s entire GHG emissions. Still there are many mitigation options available for use. 
Some of the options include: irrigation of rice paddy fields; low-input farming; coarse fodders 
and forage mixtures that emit low methane; and the use of manure as resources. All of 
these options are expected to reduce GHG emissions. We also expect to reduce CO  emissions 
2
from energy processes of the farming sector with greater use of clean energy sources and 
energy saving facilities. 
▍Transition  to  smart  farming
Industry 4.0 technologies including advanced ICT, big data and IoT provide the farming 
sector with opportunities to reduce further GHG emissions as well. Smart farms and smart 
fish farm clusters are the prime examples. ICT connected to existing farmlands and facilities 
such as greenhouses, livestock shelters and fish farms could help minimize inputs (i.e., 
energy sources, fertilizers, water, etc.). Moreover, ICT-enabled automation on smart farms 
could improve farming productivity.
Korea is employing a growing number of such smart technologies in the farming sector. 
The Government plans to deploy 7,000 ha of smart farms and 5,000 units of smart livestock 
shelters by 2022, along with three smart fish farm clusters on the coastal major hubs of 
our surrounding seas by 2023.

practices. The prime examples of such farming practices are water management in irrigated   StraChap

which reduce methane emissions. For farmers to adopt such practices in farming, related

education programs and technological supports should be continuously provided for them.  tor
There are other options worth considering: low-input farming; development of soil carbon 
storage methodologies and management; and replacement of fossil fuel with clean energy 
sources. The Government plans to pursue R&D on these low-carbon farming practices and 
also expand education and support for them for wider application.  
▍Participatory  policies  for  farmers  and  consumers
To accelerate the low-carbon transition in agriculture and rural areas, enhanced mitigation 
efforts  in  farming  sites  is  essential.  To  encourage  such  efforts,  Korea  has  operated  an 
incentive-based  emissions  reduction  program  for  farmers  since  2012.  The  number  of 
participating farms is gradually increasing. 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 952050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
Agricultural produce, meats or dairy products produced using the farming practices that 
minimize inputs, i.e., fertilizers, pesticides and farming supplies, are certified as low-carbon 
products and the Government is stepping up its effort to scale up this type of certification 
program. 
Consumers should also do their part by generating less food waste and changing their dietary 
habits to reduce their carbon footprints in their daily life. Public awareness-raising programs 
are  needed to change their  consumption patterns and lead them towards a low-carbon 
lifestyle.
▍Scaling  up  deployment  of  eco-friendly  energy
Replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon energy sources in the farming sector is the most 
feasible mitigation option with largest emissions reduction potential. Turning manure to 
energy, deployment of solar energy, and using geothermal heat pumps are available options 
that can reduce the use of fossil fuels. Using LED lamps and thermal curtains are also 
useful as they increase energy efficiency. 
Environment-friendly fishing vessels powered by electricity and hydrogen saves energy use 
and  reduces  GHG  emissions  from  fishery  production.  Developing  these  vessels  is  an 
important option to put in place a low-carbon production structure that will help us achieve 
a sustainable fishing and build climate resilience. The Government will continue to encourage 
the deployment of such fishing vessels going forward.

Processing fishery products requires a large amount of energy as it involves refrigeration/ 
freezing and high-temperature heating. The fishing industry will be encouraged to adopt 
energy saving options such as reusing air-source heat from seaweed processing plants.
Moreover, the Government plans to bring in digitized automation system based on smart  V

as best practices of combining energy transition with local development. They will also help 
us  be  prepared  for  potential  social  changes,  e.g.,  changing  industrial  site  locations  and 
population migration. 
▍Using  by-products  as  resources  for  bio-industry
Oyster shells are highly valued recyclable by-product, produced in the process of producing, 
consuming and distributing fishery products. If they are used as a replacing material for 
limestones, GHG emissions could be reduced. When the shells are used as input materials 
for bio-industry (i.e., foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics), it could also reduce the quantity 
of fishery by-products. Efforts to foster new industries using such by-product need to be 
made.

7.  Carbon  sinks(LULUCF  sector)
7.1 Status  and  outlook
▍Status  of  carbon  sinks
Lands in Korea are divided into different categories by their purpose of use: urban areas, 
croplands  and  forestlands.  These  land  types  have  different  locations,  histories  and 
surrounding circumstances. Depending on how they are used, some types of lands emit 
GHGs, but most lands with any type of vegetation covers absorb CO  through photosynthesis. 
2
Photosynthesis by plants is by far the most environmental way of removing CO  compared 
2
to any man-made CO  removal technologies. Its cost-effectiveness is also high. Forests make 
2
up 63% of the total land mass in Korea. Our forests had been seriously damaged during 
the Japanese colonial rule and the forestation rate declined down to 35% in the mid-1950s. 
But we have successfully restored our deforested lands with large-scale national reforestation 
program in the 1970s and 1980s. Success from the reforestation program has led to today’s 
high percentage of forestlands, which have made it possible for our land to become a net 
carbon sink, absorbing more carbon than it emits despite urbanization and large-scale land 
development in its modernization process.
Since the national reforestation program in the 1970s, CO  removal by forests has been 
2
on the steady rise until its peak in 2000. Since then, CO  removal has been gradually 
2
decreasing due to aging forests and changing forestland use that have followed. In 2017, 
CO  removal by forest recorded 45.7 million ton CO eq, offsetting 7.4% of energy sector 
2 2
CO emissions. 
2 
[Figure 4-31] Carbon removal by forest
98 | Chapter 4 Visions and Strategies by Sector
▍Outlook  for  carbon  sinks
Most forests of today in Korea are the result of massive tree-planting national program 
in the 1970s and 1980s. Therefore, most of the trees are currently in 3-4 age-class57), whose 
net growth volumes are the highest in their lifespan. Looking ahead, as trees and forests 
will age, the percentage of forestlands at age-class 6 or older, whose net growth volume 
declines rapidly, will increase. The National Institute of Forest Science estimates that the 
percentage of forestlands at age-class 6 or older will increase from 10.2% in 2020 to 32.9% 
in 2030 and accordingly, the annual average net growth volume per hectare will decrease 
from 4.3㎥ in 2020 to 2.6㎥ in 2030 and further down to 1.9㎥ in 2050. 
To reverse this decreasing trend of net growth volume, more timber should be produced 
from older trees so that older forestlands can be replaced with younger forestlands. Unless 
the  demand  for  domestic  timber  increases  dramatically,  however,  the  forest  age-class 
disparity and annual growth volume are unlikely to improve. Considering the current state 
of forests and timber production plans, the carbon removal is estimated to decrease by 
30% from the current level by 2050. Potential decrease in forestlands driven by growing 
urbanization is also expected to have adverse impacts on carbon sinks.

7.2 LULUCF  sector’s  2050  vision  and  strategies
Forest sector takes up a majority share of the total carbon removal in Korea. Innovative 
forest management, therefore, is a key to improving aging forests, promoting the use of 
wood products/timber and increasing carbon stocks. 
57) 10-year basis age structure of a forest. Age-class 1 includes 1-year to 10-year old trees and age-class 2 includes 11-year to 
20-year old trees. 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 992050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
On the production side, the priority focus should be on forestation and forest management 
to gradually increase their carbon absorption capacity. On the consumption side, the use 
of domestic timber should be increased to create a virtuous cycle of using forest resources. 
▍Expansion  of  forests
Expansion of forests is the most important strategy for increasing carbon sinks. Afforestation 
is a process of planting trees in an area where there was no tree before whereas reforestation 
is to re-create forests in an area where its land use was converted. 
Korea  has  already  succeeded  in  expanding  forestlands  and  there  is  nearly  no  land  left 
available for either afforestation or reforestation. However, the Government plans to increase 
carbon sinks including through creating urban green spaces for recreational use, restoring 
degraded forestlands and tree-planting in underutilized lands (i.e., marginal farms58) and 
settlements59)).
▍Maintaining  carbon  sinks
Forest management refers to the practices seeking to maintain the carbon removal to the 
highest level possible for continuous and sustainable maintenance of forestlands. In Korea 
we have two options for forest management: changing tree species, and the so-called “healthy 
forest program.”
Korea has the issues of forest age-class disparity and high percentage of privately-owned 
forestlands. Under such circumstances the practices mentioned in the above has a significant 
role to play. As a result of implementing the two options in Korea, nearly 170,000 ha of 
trees were harvested annually between 2015 and 2019. The Government plans to further 
increase the areas for tree species change and encourage forest owners to take part in their 
forest management. 
Changing tree species refers to the harvesting of forests damaged by pests, aging trees, or 
poorly stocked stands and replacing them with tree species absorbing a high level of carbon. 
After changing tree species, carbon removal level generally decreases in the short-term, but 
in the end, replaced tree species contributes to the increase in carbon sinks. Healthy forest 
program involves practices such as pruning, ivy removal, and harvest by thinning, all of 
which aim to keep forests healthy by taking into account their age and current status. In 
58) Marginal farms are lands with little agricultural value and low productivity.
59) Settlements are urban lands where forests can be created. Green spaces, stream-sides, and roadsides are the examples. 
100 | Chapter 4 Visions and Strategies by Sector
the short term, the program has positive impact on the growth of forests while in the long 
term,  produces  quality  timber  and  contributes  to  increased carbon  sinks.  Currently  the 
forestlands managed by this 5-year program (currently in phase 4 of 2019-2023) is estimated 
to be 1.1 million ha. 
▍Expanding  timber  supply
With aging forests, Korea sees its annual forest growth volume dwindling and the forest 
age disparity greatly limits sustainable management of forest resources. 
Increasing tree-harvesting volume for greater timber supply could press down carbon sink 
level in the short-term, but could address the forest age disparity, foster tree growth and 
help achieve sustainable forestry in the long-term. As timber is a carbon-neutral resource, 
the more we use wood products, the greater GHG emissions are reduced. Use of forest 
biomass produced from sustainable forest management also contributes to reducing GHG 
emissions as well as addressing renewable energy intermittency.
Some of the most durable wood products last for 100-200 years and carbon storage function 
is another feature of wood products as they lock in CO . Timber products could also have

7.3 Other  carbon  sinks Se
c

r
There are other types of carbon sinks such as coastal wetlands.
Blue carbon is a newly emerging carbon sink option. Blue carbon refers to the carbon 
absorbed by seagrasses in coastal ecosystems through photosynthesis, as well as the carbon 
captured in sediments in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. 
Marine ecosystem absorbs carbon 50 times faster than terrestrial ecosystem does. In water, 
decomposition of organic materials is slow due to its anaerobic conditions. Therefore, carbon 
deposited in plants is not degraded and remains intact for a long time. 
60) Timber processing emits 1/350 of GHGs emitted from steelmaking, and 1/1,500 of aluminum production.
The GHG emissions from building a wooden house are 1/4 of those from building a reinforced concrete house. 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 1012050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
Korea has the world’s 5th largest mud flat areas (2,482㎢) and has a great potential in blue 
carbon. Recent coastal development and environmental degradation, however, are posing 
threats to coastal environment and marine habitats, which require an urgent measure to 
restore them. The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries has a plan to restore 20 mud flats 
with the total length of 4.5 kilometers by 202561). The restoration project will be further 
scaled up going forward. A total of KRW 10 billion has been invested in the 5-year R&D 
project from 2017, which will deliver statistics on the current status of domestic blue carbon 
and develop technologies to measure and verify the amount of blue carbon. Looking ahead, 
we expect blue carbon from coastal wetlands to be included in the national GHG inventory 
to help achieve Korea’s NDC.

1.1 Assessing  NDC  implementation 
▍Importance  of  implementation  assessment
The Paris Agreement provides flexibility for all Parties to set their voluntary NDCs in the 
light of their different national circumstances. The Agreement also highlights transparency 
in all its procedures, especially in measuring, communicating and verifying GHG emissions 
and progresses in implementing NDCs. 
For the achievement of the NDC pledged to the international community, we have built 
a mechanism to assess our implementation of NDC in the 2nd Basic Plan on Climate Change 
Response which took effect in 2020.

▍Synthesis  report  for  implementation  assessment
A  series  of  assessments  are  conducted  on  how  mitigation  policies  in  Korea  have  been 
implemented in nine sectors: energy supply (electricity & heat), industry, transportation, 
building, waste, public sector, farming, forest and CCUS. A total of 81 indicators have been 
developed to measure implementation progress in each sector. 
Besides the national GHG inventory data, the report includes estimated potential emissions 
to ensure  higher objectivity. For the preparation of the synthesis report, each ministry 
collects information on their respective targets, budgets and policies corresponding to the 
81  indicators.  With  this  collected  information,  the  GIR  prepares  a  synthesis  report  in 
combination  with  the  estimates  of  potential  emissions.  In  case  the  implementation 
assessment indicates that the actual emissions surpass the targeted pathway or the progress 
is inadequate, the Government will identify such sector and provide policy feedback. 
The  implementation  assessment  is  conducted  in  compliance  with  the  transparency 
framework of the Paris Agreement, which we expect will contribute significantly to Korea’s 
achievement of the NDC.

1.2 Institutional  framework e
▍Laying  institutional  framework  for  climate  change  response
Achieving 2050 carbon neutrality requires a nationwide and cross-sectoral transformation 
as  well  as  a  robust  institutional  framework  that  could  continuously  support  such 
transformation. The basic principles and directions of Korea’s climate and energy policy 
are indicated in the Framework Act on Low Carbon Green Growth, but circumstances have 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 1072050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
changed from home and abroad since the enactment of the Act in 2010. Most notably, 
the Paris Agreement was adopted, and since then global climate action has strengthened. 
Institutional frameworks should be rearranged and adapted to incorporate such changes 
accordingly.
Looking ahead, the Government policy should be closely aligned with the efforts for the 
2050 carbon neutrality. To this end, the rearrangement of the institutional frameworks will 
be  centered  around  mobilizing  financial  resources,  i.e.,  climate  change  response  fund, 
achieving  a  just  transition  for  climate-vulnerable  populations  and  communities,  and 
promoting green finance.
▍Linking  mitigation  policies  with  energy  polices
Considering  that  energy  combustion  process  is  the  largest  source  of  GHG  emissions, 
mitigation and energy policies are closely connected. Korea’s Framework Act on Low-carbon 
Green Growth sets forth basic provisions on its climate change response and energy policies, 
and the importance of interlinking the two policy streams. 
The Act states that the Basic Plan on Climate Change Response and the Basic Energy Plan, 
both of which are overarching plans encompassing Korea’s climate and energy policies, 
should be established every five years for a planned period of 20 years. The Government 
will focus on securing high level of coherence between the two plans to ensure climate and 
energy policies are aligned to create synergies. 
▍Considering  climate  change  impact  in  policymaking
A government’s way and purpose of disbursing its budget shows the values and policies 
it is most committed to. Government budget primarily works to provide direct/indirect 
support for its people and industry, and additionally helps to build social infrastructure. 
Therefore, considering climate change impact in establishing the Government’s fiscal policy 
and setting national priorities is the first task that should be undertaken for the transition 
towards a carbon-neutral society. 
High-carbon  projects  should  be  restrained  from  the  stage  of  designing  and  disbursing 
government  budget  while  low-carbon  projects  with  environmental  benefits  should  be 
encouraged even if they involve higher costs. 
108 | Chapter 5 Innovating Implementation Base
▍Building  foundation  for  energy  transition
To lay the foundation for the clean energy transition, it is essential to take measures to 
change the current fossil fuel-oriented energy market system. The power supply system needs 
to transform in the way that it takes into account the costs of environmental pollution as 
well as the transaction costs for emissions trading so as to ensure a clean and safe energy 
distribution.  Power  pricing  scheme  also  needs  to  incorporate  social  values  of  adopting 
decentralized  and  eco-friendly  power  sources.  Furthermore,  a  flexible  and  rationalized 
electricity rate system that takes into account cost-changing factors, i.e., production costs, 
should be established to send a clear price signal to the market for better management 
of energy demand and enhancement of energy efficiency. 
With growing use of renewables, it will be crucial to solve the problem of volatile and 
intermittent power supply issue. We will need a real-time operation system of the power 
market that meets consumers’ needs and a reliable institutional framework to shift into 
a smart grid system, backed by robust financial supports.
1.3 Carbon  pricing
▍Role  of  Emissions  Trading  Scheme  (ETS)
Carbon  pricing  is  the  most  cost-effective  market  mechanism  that  incentivizes  economic 
actors  to  reduce  GHG  emissions.  The  economic  signal  is  given  by  a  carbon  price  and 
businesses decide for themselves which low-carbon technologies they should adopt, and they  In

o
v

g
 
mitigation effect. The benchmarking-based allocation of allowances also contributes to the  ImC
fair distribution of mitigation benefits across industries and to the proliferation of efficient  plemenhapter 5
ta
mitigation technologies.  tio
n
 
B
a
s
As the first country in Asia that adopted a nation-wide ETS, Korea has set itself as a leading  e
nation in implementing carbon pricing policies. The Korean ETS, or K-ETS sets emissions 
caps in consideration of its reduction target and allows companies to freely trade their 
surplus  allowances.  The  scheme  has  an  effect  of  incentivizing  corporate  investments  in 
low-carbon technologies. The Government will gradually scale up the auction volume in 
the K-ETS while increasing the share of benchmark-based allocation, both of which are 
essential policy instruments to achieve the Korea’s 2050 carbon neutrality. The Government 
will also continue to enhance support for low-carbon technologies. 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 1092050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
▍Taxation  and  charges
Carbon price literally refers to the price of carbon traded in the market, but it also includes 
carbon tax and subsidies for fossil fuels. The taxation on the use of fossil fuels works as 
a positive tool to accelerate the low-carbon fuel transition while fossil fuel subsidies have 
negative  impacts.  Effects  of  taxation,  charges  and  other  pricing  tools  should  be 
comprehensively  assessed  in  relation  to  the  K-ETS  to  build  an  effective  carbon  pricing 
system.  To  prevent  such  carbon  pricing  scheme  from  harming  domestic  industries’ 
competitiveness  in  the  international  market,  a  strong  international  partnership  and 
collaboration will be required in achieving carbon neutrality. 
1.4 Leadership  by  public  sector
▍Public  sector’s  leading  role
The public sector is in the best position to show its commitment to and progress in GHG 
emissions reduction. A government’s leadership in pursuing mitigation efforts could set an 
exemplary model and serve as a demonstration for the private sector. 
Korea has operated the GHG emissions Target Management System (TMS) for the public 
sector  since  2011.  A  total  of  800  government  entities,  comprised  of  central  and  local 
governments  and  public  agencies  are  subject  to  the  TMS.  Approximately  11%  of  GHG 
emissions has been reduced since its introduction. The Government will continue to identify 
and introduce various policy options to encourage the public sector to take the lead in 
mitigation efforts. Improving building energy efficiency, scaling up deployment of renewables 
and mandating the use of eco-friendly vehicles are some examples of those policy options 
to ultimately achieve public sector’s carbon neutrality by 2050. 
1.5 Korean  Green  New  Deal
▍Pushing  for  Green  New  Deal  as  catalyst  for  carbon  neutrality
In achieving 2050 carbon neutrality, public investments play a catalyzing role. 
Last July, Korea announced its plan for the Korean New Deal as a strategy to overcome 
the Covid-19 pandemic as well as to address climate and ecological crises. With the aim 
110 | Chapter 5 Innovating Implementation Base
of investing KRW 160 trillion by 2025, the Korean New Deal includes the Green New Deal 
as one of its pillars. The Green New Deal also aims to mobilize KRW 73.4 trillion by 2025.
▍Key  areas  of  Green  New  Deal
The Green New Deal is underpinned by the following three key areas. 
First area is green transition in cities, spatial planning and living infrastructure. Green 
remodeling will be carried out in public facilities as they are closely related to the people’s 
daily life. The public facilities will include 225,000 household units of public rental housing, 
2,890 units of school building, 2,000 healthcare and medical centers and 1,000 cultural 
facilities.  The  remodeling  will  involve:  installing  renewable  energy  facilities;  improving 
building insulations; and using eco-friendly construction materials. This retrofitting aims 
to reduce building energy consumption while increasing building energy production to turn 
the facilities into zero-energy buildings. Furthermore, the Government plans to create a 
total of 25 smart green cities that are more climate-resilient and conduct urban ecosystem 
restoration projects. 
Second area is the proliferation of low-carbon and decentralized energy. The Government 
plans to increase solar and wind energy facilities by 3-fold by 2025 through green energy 
projects. A profit-sharing model will be further developed to ensure that the profits from 
the  green  energy  projects  are  shared  with  local  communities.  Support  for  eco-friendly 
vehicles  will  reach  not  only  passenger  vehicles  but  also  for  freight  trucks,  construction 
machinery and other vehicle types. The Government also plans to make R&D investments 
in future mobility to be the world leader in this area. In line with this effort, the Government 
will contribute to the transition to green shipping through expansion of eco-friendly vessels,  Inn

including replacement of public vessels with eco-friendly vessels.  tin

Third area is building innovative green industry ecosystems. By 2025, the Government will  plemhapte

medium-sized enterprises specialized in green businesses. The Government also plans to  e
mobilize  KRW  1.9  trillion  of  green  finance  to  support  business  investments  in  green 
transition.
▍Next  steps
The first step of Korea’s carbon neutrality has been already taken with the Green New Deal. 
However, for the Green New Deal to ultimately lead to carbon neutrality, the role of public

investment as a pump-primer is critical. In other words, the public investment should play 
the role of further scaling up private efforts for carbon neutrality. 
After its announcement of the Korean New Deal, the Government has released strategies 
to promote New Deal Fund and regionally balanced New Deal in an effort to promote private 
sector growth and regional development at the business and local levels. The Government 
will lead the changes from private sector by mobilizing the participatory New Deal Fund. 
Through the Fund, we will encourage businesses and people’s participation. With regionally 
balanced New Deal, the role of local governments, who are the main actors of the Green 
New Deal, will be further expanded.

2.  Social  innovation
2.1 Raising  public  awareness
▍Raising  people’s  awareness  of  climate  crisis
To make people take climate action in reality, there must be a wide public recognition and 
broad consensus on the severity of climate crisis. The society as a whole should have a 
clear and deep understanding of how serious climate change is and be willing to engage 
in collective efforts to respond to it. 
However, setting a common goal and sharing identical values with members of the society 
of various backgrounds and perspectives is not an easy task. To make this possible, we 
need  a  participatory  process  of  engaging  all  stakeholders  including  the  Government  to 
discuss a set of common values and perspectives that all of us could share. The Government 
will play a central role in this process to help its people understand the current state of 
climate  crisis  and  coordinate  their  different  interests.  People  should  have  an  access  to 
necessary information to freely exchange their opinions and take part in the Government’s 
policymaking. We need to build a climate information platform to provide such access for 
the general public. 
▍Public  outreach  campaign  for  climate  action
In
n
o
v
Public campaign is a powerful tool to raise people’s awareness of the climate situation and  atin
g
 
mobilize  people’s  climate  action  in  reality.  Traditional  public  outreach  methods  include  ImC
employing celebrities as climate ambassadors and using cultural contents (i.e., e-comics,  plemenhapter 5
ta
animation movies, documentary films, etc.). Web-based talks, social networking services and  tio
n
 
B
other newly emerging channels should be also considered as options especially for the youth,  a
s
e
because they are the next generations who will change the course of climate action in the 
future. 
As part of its public outreach, the Government has been working on public campaigns on 
paperless mobile receipts, single-use items, and public transportations. The Government 
also designated a week around 22 April as “climate change week” to raise people’s attention 
to the climate change issue.

There  are  other  incentive-based  programs  to  encourage  people  to  reduce  their  carbon 
footprints:  Carbon  Point  Program  and  Green  Card.  The  Carbon  Point  Program  offers 
households  monetary  rewards  in  proportion  to  the  amount  of  saved  resources  (i.e., 
electricity,  water  and  gas).  Currently  2.8  million  households  are  participating  in  this 
program. The Green Card gives cardholders discounts for using public transportation and 
buying eco-friendly products. A total of 20 million Green Cards has been issued so far, 
encouraging people’s eco-friendly purchases. 
▍Environmental  education
The role of government and industry is critical in tackling climate change, fine dust and 
water pollution, but the general public is also closely related to these environmental issues. 
For climate change, we are polluters and victims at the same time. All of us are responsible 
for GHG emissions, but affected by climate change impacts as well. Therefore, a fundamental 
solution  to  overcome  environmental  and  climate  crises  facing  us  is  to  help  citizens 
understand what causes climate change and what should be done to tackle it and make 
them stand at the forefront of our environmental issues. The solution is delivered by the 
environmental education.
The  Government  will  offer  various  education  opportunities  for  people’s  knowledge  and 
capacity-building  on  climate  change  response.  Previously  economic  perspectives  and 
short-term  approaches  were  adopted  in  climate  change  education  programs,  but  going 
forward, long-term values and sustainability should be introduced more to the curriculum. 
114 | Chapter 5 Innovating Implementation Base
Current national-level education programs need to be diversified at local-level and expanded 
into school education programs to provide lifelong learning opportunities for people at all 
ages. 
▍Higher  education  and  research
Higher education at universities and colleges has a significant role to play in environmental 
education as primary and secondary education does. For the social and cultural paradigm 
shift we aspire to, R&D projects with long-term perspectives should be continuously carried 
out by universities, the place for cultivating talents and intellectuals. We need more graduate 
schools dedicated to fostering professionals with high level of expertise in climate change, 
offering a multidisciplinary curriculum considering the complexity of climate change issue. 
This will contribute to fostering more climate specialists who will meet the future needs 
of businesses in their climate risk management, thus creating more jobs. 
The Government will expand the scope of the Green Campus project, currently undertaken 
at university level, to open up a participatory process for education, research and local 
cooperation for all stakeholders. This Whole Institution Approach will provide educational 
institutions with new opportunities to innovate themselves and set an exemplary model of 
sustainable development for local communities. 
2.2 Governance  and  decision-making

▍Broader  public  engagement  in  policymaking va
tin
g
 
In  the  past,  the  whole  process  of  designing  and  making  policies  was  undertaken  by  ImplemChapte
governments  alone,  and  the  public  opinions  were  sought  only  after  the  policies  were  enr 5
ta
implemented. Recently, however, as people’s right to know gains importance and diverse  tio
n
 
B
web-based communications channels become available, there has been a growing public  as
e
demand for the engagement in policymaking process. 
In fact, the 2050 Carbon Neutral Strategy is the prime example of such public engagement 
in policymaking. In establishing the Strategy, public opinions were taken into consideration 
to the maximum extent possible. The 2050 Low-carbon Vision Forum described in Chapter 
I has been operated for nine months from the stage of outlining the Strategy. Then the 
Government built on what was discussed and produced from the Forum and incorporated 
the results of extensive public discussions in establishing the Strategy. 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 1152050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
The largest group of stakeholders of the Government’s climate change policy is its people. 
People  should  be  fully  informed  and  have  a  greater  access  in  their  engagement  in 
policymaking. They have the right to be heard as they are the main stakeholders of national 
policies. Previously policymaking process was participated by specific sectors and groups 
of people – experts, businesses and civil society. The new policymaking process, therefore, 
should include the youth and elderly, who had been left unheard in the past. The youth, 
in particular, should be given opportunities to participate in climate policymaking because 
they will be the generation who will be most affected by climate change. 
▍Enhancing  conflict  management  mechanism
A departure from universal values shared among members of the society over a given period 
of time inevitably causes conflicts. An aspiration towards carbon-neutral society means a 
departure from fossil fuel-oriented growth, which could threaten livelihood of fossil fuel 
workers. In setting up the policies from which sharp conflicts of interests are anticipated, 
we cannot rely on conventional conflict management. 
To resolve such conflicts, we should first build a broad public consensus around the issue 
at stake. A public deliberation process, used in Korea to resolve the fine dust issue, could 
be another effective solution. Building a mechanism dedicated to conflict resolution is also 
important. Instead of taking one-off responses whenever conflict arises, we should set up 
a specialized organization with the system that predicts and prevents potential conflicts in 
order to minimize unnecessary disputes. 
While people seek to become the center of action in bringing a carbon-neutral future, they 
should also benefit from such action. Benefits and progresses from carbon-neutral transition 
should be distributed in an equal and fair manner. Especially for renewable energy projects 
carried out at local level, a clear profit-sharing mechanism should be established to motivate 
participation by local communities and minimize potential conflicts among residents. 
▍Laying  groundwork  for  just  transition
A carbon-neutral transition will improve sustainability in industry sector in the long-term, 
but in the short-term it could downsize fossil fuel-based businesses and put existing jobs 
and livelihoods in jeopardy. 
In preparation for such transition and subsequent industrial restructuring, we should ensure 
that the workers from conventional industries are provided with retraining opportunities 
116 | Chapter 5 Innovating Implementation Base
to build capacity and move to new industries. Those who will have lost jobs in the transition 
should be provided with support for living and job opportunities in other businesses. 
The Government is fostering human resources for carbon-neutral transition by developing 
a national standard for vocational skills and expanding job training programs for low-carbon 
new industry. From January 2021, the Government plans to scale up programs to match 
up people with job opportunities and provide the unemployed people with unemployment 
insurance. Unemployment benefits, job training opportunities and job counselling will also 
be provided to strengthen the social safety net. Through such support, vulnerable populations 
to  be  affected  by  the  transition  will  receive  support  for  their  livelihood  and  retraining 
opportunities. 
2.3 Role  of  local  governments
▍Greater  role  of  local  governments
It is clear that the central government alone cannot lead the entire population towards a 
national vision. Local governments’ role is vital in broadening people’s understanding of 
low-carbon transition and keeping momentum for it. Especially for emissions reduction in 
the transportation and building sector, we need strategies and implementation at local level 
as the tasks, such as building infrastructure for eco-friendly vehicles and improving energy 
efficiency in old buildings, require local actions. Central and local governments should jointly 
establish a cooperative model for just transition in consideration of their respective roles

and find a way forward to operate it efficiently.  ov
a
tin
g
 
Local governments’ action to establish their own visions could inspire the central government  ImC
to bolster its climate action. In Korea, 17 metropolitan cities and 63 municipalities declared  plemenhapter 5

their aspiration for 2050 carbon neutrality and launched the Carbon-neutral Cities Coalition  tio

in July 2020. Such local action will prosper going forward, catalyzing carbon-neutrality  a

transition at national level. 
▍Emissions  reduction  projects  at  local  level
In GHG emissions reduction projects, local governments are increasingly taking on a growing 
role as project developers. The city of Seoul has been working on “One Less Nuclear Power 
Plant” policy and providing financial support for small-scale solar power generation. Jeju 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 1172050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
Island is focusing its investment in increasing energy independence under the target of 
becoming a Carbon-free Island in 2030. Similar community-level actions are also found. 
The village of Seongdaegol’s “Living Lab Project” is the prime example. The Living Lab 
is a community-based program run by local residents’ voluntary participation with the aim 
of  addressing  social  issues.  The  program  has  shown  the  possibility  of  community-level 
low-carbon transition.
[Figure 5-2] Seongdaegol Village Living Lab Program
2.4 Green  finance  strategy
▍Green  finance  and  climate  change
Green finance is part of the sustainable finance that takes into account environmental, social 
and  governance  (ESG)  considerations,  focusing  especially  on  climate  change  and 
environmental  elements.  Unlike  traditional  finance  mainly  focusing  on  profitability  by 
striking a balance between financial return and risk in managing assets, the green finance 
aims  to  increase  resilience  to  external  shocks  such  as  climate  change  and  other 
environmental risks in forecasting financial return and risk.  
The  impacts  of  climate  change  will  grow  further,  having  serious  repercussions  on  real 
economy and financial system. Climate risks include not only physical damages from natural 
disasters  or  air  pollution,  but  also  investment  losses  to  be  incurred  by  stranded  assets 
particularly  in  fossil  fuel  industry.  Climate  risks  could  also  cause  financial  losses  for 
businesses and have adverse impacts on their lenders, i.e., banks and financial institutions, 
which  could  grow  into  system-wide  risks.  Managing  climate  risks,  therefore,  is  gaining 
importance in the aspect of securing financial stability of the market. The Government plans 
to take a series of policy measures to promote green finance. 
118 | Chapter 5 Innovating Implementation Base
▍Mobilizing  green  finance
Fostering green industry is a key to the success in green transition. For the continued growth 
of green industry, securing reliable funding sources is essential, and there are several means 
of  mobilizing  funding  sources  that  can  be  arranged  by  the  Government.  For  instance, 
providing loan interest deduction for solar energy businesses, LED lamp projects and other 
green projects could be one option while selling investment funds for green industry growth 
could  also  be  effective.  The  scale  and  types  of  such  green  investment  funds  should  be 
expanded and diversified. 
Korea will continue to expand its investment in certified green technologies and facilities 
for air pollution prevention and GHG emissions reduction. Continuous efforts are needed 
to create policy funds investing in environmental businesses and overseas environmental 
projects. Such policy funds could be mobilized through the combination of government 
funding and private investments raised for the purpose of fostering green industry growth. 
The  investments  made  from  such  policy  funds  could  play  a  role  as  pump-primer  and 
contribute to further growth of environmental businesses, especially the ones that are small 
but has strong potential. It is also important to support those businesses to ensure they 
will grow into flagship companies and expand their entry into the overseas market. 
The Government will communicate more closely with the private sector to unlock private 
finance for environment sector. Having Investor Relations events for environmental industry 
and regular meetings with asset management companies are part of such communication 
efforts. As such, the public sector will take the lead in accelerating the green transition 
across our society.

▍Establishing  taxonomy  for  green  finance tin

ImC
For green investments to produce real environmental benefits, the so-called “green- washing”  plemhapte
must  be  prevented.  Greenwashing  is  a  process  of  providing  investors  with  misleading  entar 5
tio
information that a particular investment is environmentally sound. We need a taxonomy  n

that could inform investors of whether an investment is truly environmentally- friendly to  e
weed out greenwashing. 
The EU is in the process of developing a taxonomy for sustainable finance to scale up 
financial flows into sustainable investments and wipe out greenwashing. Its Green Bond 
Standard  is  planned  to  be  aligned  with  the  taxonomy.  Korea  also  plans  to  build  up  a 
taxonomy  for  green  finance  to  channel  financial  flows  into  the  businesses  with  real 
environmental benefits. 
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 1192050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
▍Better  access  to  ESG  information  through  TCFD
ESG  stands  for  Environmental,  Social  and  Corporate  Governance  which  refers  to  the 
non-financial factors in measuring sustainability and social impact of an investment in a 
company. Internationally a greater scope of ESG disclosure is being encouraged to promote 
socially responsible investments and sustainability at corporate level. 
Upon G20’s request, the Financial Stability Board launched a Taskforce on Climate-related 
Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD)  that  recommends  all  companies  including  financial  firms 
disclose information on climate change-related financial risks in a transparent manner. The 
Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Korea has declared its support for the TCFD 
in May 2020. 
The Government is pursuing to realign the environmental information disclosure system 
and  encouraging  businesses,  especially  listed  ones  to  disclose  their  environmental 
information. The Government further plans to encourage other businesses including financial 
institutions  to  disclose  their  financial  information  in  accordance  with  the  TCFD 
recommendations.
For individual companies to disclose such information as recommended by the TCFD, the 
assessment  of  climate-  and  environment-related  risks  to  the  entire  industry  should  be 
conducted,  but  the  industry  currently  has  only  limited  information  on  such  risks.  The 
Government will build an institutional framework for climate- and environment-related risk 
assessment so that each industry sector and individual companies could assess their own 
risks and have an access to the risk information.

The  Government  also  plans  to  establish  a  guideline  for  environmentally  responsible 
investments for private sector investors. The investors could use this guideline in accessing 
the disclosed information on corporate environmental risks and opportunities. The guideline 
120 | Chapter 5 Innovating Implementation Base
is expected to help investors make informed decisions and promote environmentally sound 
investments. 
▍Scaling  up  green  finance  infrastructure
Setting up dedicated organizations and capacity-building facilities is critical for policies and 
institutional frameworks to take hold. To further promote ESG and mobilize green finance, 
we need a specialized agency that provides environmental information management and 
disclosure services and targeted education for businesses. 
Fora,  seminars  and  conferences  to  share  knowledge  on  green  finance  are  becoming 
increasingly important as well. A vibrant exchange of opinion should take place through 
discussions among various stakeholders from governments and businesses. Such extensive 
discussions will be the basis of paving a way forward for green finance of our society. Korea 
will  fully engage in international discussions on climate change-related risks and green 
finance and use the lessons learned to improve our policies. We will continue to closely 
work with the TCFD and UNEP Finance Initiative as well.

3.  Technological  innovation
3.1 Establishing  policies  for  technological  convergence
▍Driving  R&D  for  technological  integration  and  convergence
GHG emissions reduction requires a system-wide approach across the national climate and 
energy policies, and a stand-alone technology will never be sufficient undertake the task. 
This is the reason why we need a significant level of R&D effort for mitigation technology 
convergence.
The prime example is Power-to-Gas (P2G) and Power-to-Liquid (P2L)63) technologies. The 
P2G and P2L are core technologies to store extra power from renewables and convert it 
into other forms of energy. These innovative technologies could be developed through the 
combination  of  renewable  energy-based  power  generation  and  chemical  conversion 
technologies.  Large-scale  hydrogen  production  is  a  prerequisite  for  our  vision  of 
hydrogen-based economy. Europe and Japan already have a hydrogen production technology 
using natural gas reforming, available for commercial use. This technology has advantages 
of reliable hydrogen supply and cost competitiveness, but also has a limitation of generating 
CO . To overcome this limitation, R&D efforts need to be pursued to integrate the current 
2
technology with CCUS for a CO -free, eco-friendly hydrogen production technology. 
2
To create maximized synergies, the Life Cycle Assessment approach should be adopted in 
developing  core  mitigation  technologies  and  a  government-wide  collaboration  among 
different  ministries  and  agencies  is  critical.  The  prime  example  is  the  ongoing  CCUS 
technology development project led by the Government64). We will continue to work together 
at government level to make progress in such R&D projects. 
To expand commercial development of basic and original technologies, it is also important 
to take into account users’ opinions from the initiation stage of technology development. 
In demonstration stage, an open environment should be created to invite more companies 
that will actually use those technologies to engage in the R&D process. 
63) The P2L technology converts renewable energy into chemical energy (i.e., hydrogen, natural gas and liquid fuel), not into electricity.
64) The project is participated by Ministry of Science and ICT, Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries 
and Ministry of Environment. 
122 | Chapter 5 Innovating Implementation Base
▍Establishing  R&D  foundation  for  mitigation  technologies
We need a clear set of national strategies for climate technology R&D in consideration of 
technological  developments from  home and  abroad under  the new climate  regime. The 
Government will closely examine domestic and oversea R&D trends and lay the legislative 
framework for setting national strategies. 
Looking ahead, with growing technology convergence, new climate-related business models 
will emerge and accordingly, the demand for international standardization will increase. 
Preemptive measures should be taken to be ready for such surge in standardization demand. 
3.2 Evaluating  mitigation  potentials
▍Evaluating  mitigation  potentials  from  technology  development  stage
To secure effective mitigation tools, each mitigation technology needs to be assessed for 
their  potentials  in  reducing  emissions.  The  assessment  will  be  conducted  after 
comprehensively considering Korea’s mitigation circumstances. The Government will find 
and determine where and how the data from the assessment could be used. 
Before starting R&D process of all mitigation technologies, their mitigation potentials should 
be estimated in advance and considered from the design stage. Once those technologies 
are  developed  as  part  of  an  emissions  reduction  project,  more accurate  and  systematic 
assessment should be conducted for their mitigation potentials. At this stage, the technology 
development should be aligned with the general project purpose and the assessment data  Inn
o
v
a
should be used as the basis for policymaking.  tin
g
 
ImC
We also need consistent methodologies and standards for measuring mitigation potentials.  plemhapte
The measured data will be also used as the basis in deciding which technologies are eligible  entar 5
tio
n
for government R&D funding as well as new project planning and evaluation.   
B
a
s
e
An  observation-based  GHG  emissions  verification  system  should  be  established,  using 
artificial satellites. The emissions reductions made by mitigation technologies should be 
verified through this system to objectively assess their technological effects. 
▍Assessing  co-benefits  of  adaptation  for  carbon-neutral  society
Adaptation techniques, i.e., building green infrastructure and urban ecosystems are critical 
as they create carbon sinks which produce co-benefits of reducing further GHG emissions.
The Government of the Republic of Korea | 1232050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
A system of assessing the effects of adaptation techniques will help lay out an optimal 
trajectory towards a carbon-neutral society creating synergies with mitigation technologies. 
▍Adopting  Life  Cycle  Assessment  approach  in  technology  assessment
Besides mitigation potentials, there are other environmental impacts that need to be assessed 
in  developing  sustainable,  low-carbon  green  technologies.  Certain  technologies  could 
contribute  to GHG  emissions  reduction, but  at  the same  time they  could have  adverse 
environmental impacts such as resource depletion, acidification and chemical poisoning. 
Due  to  the  possibility  of  such  trade-offs,  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  overall 
environmental impacts needs to be conducted in developing low-carbon technologies. 
As  technologies  are  increasingly  combined  and  integrated,  synergies  from  technological 
convergence should be examined as well. Environmental impact assessments of applying 
a specific line of technologies should be conducted both at national and global level. For 
instance, the EV deployment in automotive industry could have a significant environmental 
impact not only in transportation but also in power generation sector. As environmental 
impacts  could  vary  widely  between  sectors,  a  comprehensive  assessment  is  needed  to 
precisely understand how the applied technology affects each industry. 
For the environmental impact assessment of the technologies applied in various sectors, 
we could adopt the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach for quantitative evaluation. We 
also need a common LCA model to assess overall environmental impacts of the technologies 
at R&D stage so that it could be used in developing R&D strategies as well as in policymaking 
for promoting technologies. 
3.3 Scaling  up  investment  in  technological  breakthroughs
Transitioning to a carbon-neutral society would be impossible if we depend on existing 
mitigation technologies that are commercially available. Current R&D is mainly focused on 
developing technologies for commercial use and deploying them on the market. To lead 
the future market with our technological competence, however, we need greater efforts to 
keep pushing the boundaries and trying out new technological breakthroughs. R&D for basic 
and original technologies should continue to evolve to create such technological innovations. 
124 | Chapter 5 Innovating Implementation Base
In the present R&D circumstances in Korea, compared to the investment in technologies 
readily available for commercial use, much lower investment is being made in creative basic 
and  original  technologies.  To  achieve  carbon  neutrality,  our  society  needs  to  improve 
readiness for the future energy mix and develop original technologies that will enable us 
to dramatically reduce GHG emissions. Further actions are needed to accelerate technological 
innovations and breakthroughs that will allow us to fully harness their potential in the 
future65).  
Mitigation technologies currently available for commercial use are reaching their limits in 
terms  of  energy  efficiency  and  capacity,  raising  pressing  needs  for  new  innovative 
technologies66).  R&D  for  key  innovative  technologies  – smart  grid,  ESS,  smart  heating, 
ventilation  and  air-conditioning,  and  prognostics  and  health  management  – should  be 
continuously  pursued  to  improve  overall  energy  efficiency  and  convert  into  low-carbon 
industrial processes that will enable us to cut more GHG emissions from the energy sector. 
A  hydrogen-based  economy  could  be  achieved  by  adopting  highly  efficient,  reliable, 
affordable and innovative technologies in all processes of producing, storing, distributing 
and using hydrogen. Latest technological breakthroughs, such as artificial photosynthesis 
and  petrovskite  solar  cells,  are  expected  to  create  a  high  value-added  technological 
leap-forward and should be developed further as well. The Government will establish a 
roadmap that lays out various R&D strategies and plans for such technological breakthroughs 
and pursue efforts to scale up investment in them.

65) In the past lead acid batteries were most widely used type of battery, but lithium-ion batteries started to dominate the market 
in 1991 with its development by Sony. Recently as safety concerns arise in relation to battery explosion risks, R&D is expanding 
on solid-state batteries.
66) For instance, maximum efficiency of amorphous solar cells is approximately 30%, so new type of solar cells using advanced 
device or new materials (i.e., petrovskite or tandem solar cells) need to be developed to overcome this limitation.

Way  Forward2050 Carbon Neutral Strategy of the Republic of Korea towards a sustainable and green society
▍Establishing  the  implementation  framework  for  the  Strategy
 The 2050 carbon neutrality has become a global common goal to address climate change 
and a new international economic order. Korea should also join this paradigm shift and 
move from “adaptive GHG emissions reduction” towards “proactive climate response” in 
building a new economic and social structure fit for a carbon-neutral society in 2050.
For the robust implementation of the Strategy, the Government announced the “2050 Carbon 
Neutral Strategy Action Plan” on 7 December 2020. At this critical juncture of great economic 
and social transformation, the Plan outlines the essential elements for achieving carbon 
neutrality, economic prosperity, and a better quality of life, all at the same time.
The  Plan  lays  out  three  important  policy  directions:  low-carbon  economic  structure, 
low-carbon industrial ecosystem, and just transition towards carbon-neutral society, along 
with 10 key tasks such as energy carbon neutrality, industry transformation and circular 
economy roadmap.
▍Implementation  of  2050  carbon  neutrality 
The 2050 carbon neutrality is a long-term mission that spans around 30 years, hence it 
must be backed up by a robust implementation mechanism and clear strategies for consistent 
implementation. 
The Government will build a strong governance structure, including by establishing the 
Presidential Committee on 2050 Carbon Neutrality for the systematic implementation of 
carbon neutrality by 2050. All relevant policies will be presented to the Committee for further 
consideration.  
We  will  develop  scenarios  for  the  2050  carbon  neutrality,  taking  into  account  Korea’s 
mitigation potential, and level of technological advancements. Based on such scenarios, we 
will also establish implementation strategies and specific plans by sector. 
Along the process, we will take a closer look into the way forward towards the 2050 carbon 
neutrality and reach social consensus on the path we should tread upon. We will do our 
utmost to further raise our ambition level of the 2030 emissions reduction target in our 
NDC before 2025. 
Looking ahead, technologies to tackle climate change will evolve with continued advances 
in innovation and technological breakthroughs, and the pace of such advances will accelerate. 
Global climate action for carbon neutrality will also gain traction going forward and the 
action will become even stronger and more concrete. 
In line with such global progress, this stake in Strategy will be reviewed and updated on 
a regular basis so that we may take a step closer towards better, carbon-neutral future.
