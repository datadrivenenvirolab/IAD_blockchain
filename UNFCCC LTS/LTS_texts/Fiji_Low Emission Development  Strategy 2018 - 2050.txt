It remains absolutely critical that we take urgent action, on a worldwide scale, to limit 
global temperature rise to 1.5°C if life as we know it is to continue on planet earth. 
Warming beyond that level would be disastrous and irreversible for future generations. 
We urge nations to follow Fiji’s lead by immediately and ambitiously reducing 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and by aiming to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. 
The future of our planet – and of our children and grandchildren who will inherit it – 
depends on it.

•  A “BAU Conditional scenario,” which reflects the implementation of existing and 
official policies, targets, and technologies that are conditional in the sense that Fiji 
would rely on external or international financing to implement mitigation actions, 
thus this scenario would have higher ambition than “BAU Unconditional.” 
•  A “High Ambition scenario” projects ambitions beyond those already specified in 
policies, relying on the adoption of new, more ambitious policies and technologies 
and availability of additional financing to implement mitigation actions, and 
achieves significant emission reductions by 2050 compared with the business-as-
usual scenarios. 
•  A “Very High Ambition scenario” projects ambitions well beyond those already 
specified in policies, thus relying on the adoption of new, significantly more 
ambitious policies and availability of new technologies and additional financing 
to implement mitigation actions, and in which most sectors achieve net zero or 
negative emissions, by 2050. 
These scenarios were elaborated for each sector, including: electricity and other 
energy use; land transport; domestic maritime transport; domestic air transport; 
agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU); and waste. Coastal wetlands (blue 
carbon) was also considered. The scenarios were then aggregated to build a whole-of-
economy emission reductions pathway for each scenario. 
Following extensive stakeholder consultations, analysis, and modelling of different 
scenarios for each sector, the LEDS shows that under the Very High Ambition scenario 
net zero emissions can be achieved during the year 2041, after which emissions would 
increasingly be net negative. The most significant mitigation of emissions would 
result from complete transformation of Fiji’s energy sector to one based on a wide 
variety of on-grid and off-grid renewable energy generation. This transformation in the 
energy sector would involve the adoption of clean energy for commercial, industrial, 
and household use, as well as the conversion of most of Fiji’s land transport systems 
to electric vehicles. The domestic aviation and maritime sectors will also convert 
to electricity at a more modest scale, while introducing other measures which will

2.1 NATIONAL CONTEXT
that Fiji meets 
Fiji is a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) in the South Pacific, encompassing 
its development 
an area of 18,725 km2, and includes 332 islands in total, 110 of which are inhabited. 
Its population is 884,887, according to the 2017 national census, with most of the  objectives”
population located on the islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Fiji has a large exclusive 
economic zone of approximately 1.3 million square kilometres.13  Fiji’s current per 
capita income stands at approximately USD 5,000. The economy of Fiji has been 
growing since 2009, with an average growth rate of close to 4% from 2011 to 2015.14  
Growth has been driven by robust tourism and construction industries, with increasing 
manufacturing, finance, and transportation sectors. Investment in Fiji increased to 26% 
of GDP in 2015, primarily in association with private sector investment, and growth is 
expected to continue.15 
In order to ensure sustainable development, it is critical to decouple economic 
growth from carbon emissions, while at the same time ensuring that Fiji meets its 
development objectives. This LEDS presents deep decarbonisation pathways across all 
major sectors of Fiji’s economy, including: electricity and other energy use; transport 
(land, maritime, and domestic aviation); agriculture, forestry, and other land use 
(AFOLU); coastal wetlands (blue carbon); and waste.16 
2.2 A WARMING PLANET 
In February 2016, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones in history, Cyclone 
Winston, made landfall in Fiji, with peak sustained winds of 233 km per hour. The 
storm caused 80% of the population to lose power, while nearly 40% of the population 
was significantly affected by the storm, facing loss of life, property, and livelihoods. 
Damage amounted to more than USD 0.9 billion.17 It is increasingly possible to 
attribute extreme weather events, such as Cyclone Winston, in part to climate change.
In a warming world, Fiji will face cyclones of increasing intensity, as well as other 
significant impacts. The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the IPCC reiterates that 
human impacts on the climate system are incontrovertible, and that anthropogenic 
GHG emissions will cause and, indeed, already have caused significant impacts,  The recently released IPCC Special Report on Global  associated with different levels of warming. Warming of

4.1 ELECTRICITY AND OTHER ENERGY GENERATION AND USE supply”
4.1.1  Overview
This section examines the electricity and other energy use component of Fiji’s LEDS 
including grid electricity on the major islands, domestic cooking fuels, and LPG usage 
in commercial and industrial sectors. It also deals with the electricity generation and 
usage as well as cooking fuel consumption for off-grid locations, including off-grid 
tourism resorts and the Vatukoula Mine. 
Fiji’s sole utility Energy Fiji Limited (EFL), formerly Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA), 
provides grid electricity to the three major islands, Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, and Ovalau, 
and has recently established a fourth utility grid network system in Taveuni in 2016. 
EFL is a vertically-integrated utility providing generation, transmission, distribution 
and sales services. The energy mix for electricity generation comprises mainly 
hydropower (varying between 45-65% over the last 10 years depending on annual 
rainfall and other factors) and thermal (industrial diesel oil, or IDO, and heavy fuel 
oil, or HFO) with some contributions from biomass and wind power (1-3%) and under 
1% contributed by solar during 2005-2015. Fiji regulations do not allow more than 
500 ppm of sulphur in IDO. 36 The total installed capacity in 2016 was 316 MW with 
contributions from hydropower (130 MW), wind and biomass (21 MW), and diesel (164.9

the four scenarios for the energy sector. LEAP software is utilized by a number of 
countries for integrated resource planning and GHG mitigation assessments and 
developing LEDS.49 A bottom-up approach is used in the demand structure which was 
divided into household, commercial, industrial, and streetlights components. Tourism 
has been included commercial and industrial demand. The base year for modelling is 
2013 and end year is 2050. Default emission factors from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for 
National GHG Inventories were used for each emission source.

Number of Households and Efficiency Measures. The 2017 preliminary households 
census survey data provided by FBoS was used for calculating household demand. The 
demand projections are as follows and these numbers are used in all four scenarios:
•  The overall number of households in Fiji in 2013 was 182,282. It is assumed that 
there were 4.75 persons in each household which is taken from 2007 census report.51
•  The projected fraction of urban households are based on FBoS data:
Year 2013 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050
% urban 52.98 55.57 57.37 58.97 60.51 62.01 63.46 64.93
•  Assumptions for the energy efficiency measures are taken from reports by Fiji’s 
Energy Labelling and Minimum Energy Performance Standards for Appliances and 
Lighting (MEPSL) programme.52 It is further assumed that the Minimum Energy 
Performance Standard (MEPS) for refrigerators and freezers were implemented 
starting in 2012. For the other products’ efficiency, measures are assumed to be in 
place from 2015.

Figure 26. Very High Ambition scenario – Electricity and Other Energy.
Figure 27 shows the share of renewable energy sources under all four scenarios. It shows that under BAU 
Unconditional scenario, in the absence of additional financing, the proportion of renewable energy will drop  
to less than 60% of total generation if the transport sector is electrified. 
Comparison of Scenarios
Figure 28 shows total emission reductions under all four scenarios. It shows that the interventions outlined in the 
Very High Ambition scenario will be required to make Fiji’s energy sector fully renewable and reduce emissions to 
almost zero. Note, all electricity generation (including for transport sector) related emissions are present in Figure 
28. For purposes of this LEDS, it is important to note that emissions from the burning of biomass are assumed to be 
carbon neutral.

Table 9 summarizes the necessary installed capacity of various generation technologies under the four scenarios 
and Figure 29 presents the corresponding approximate investment costs for each. Under the BAU Unconditional 
scenario, which is based on lower renewable energy capacity, the total cost of investment is estimated at about USD 
1.4 billion. This increases to USD 4.193 billion under the BAU Conditional scenario, whereas USD 5.386 billion is 
required for a High Ambition scenario and USD 9.211 billion for a Very High Ambition scenario. The costs of different 
technologies are taken directly from the NDC Implementation Roadmap as well as from IRENA.75 It should be 
recognized that energy storage costs in the future are uncertain. The costs are currently on a downward curve and, 
should this continue, then costs for the High Ambition and Very High Ambition scenario could change significantly 
in the future. The newly added electricity generators are essential for decarbonising the transport sectors and this 
adds significantly to the investment cost for the electricity sector. All costs are high-level estimates and specific 
projects will require feasibility studies to define detailed design and costs which may vary from the estimates below, 
particularly for technologies new to Fiji, for example for pumped hydro.

•  Mode Shift. If most or all vehicles are electric, mode shift will no longer reduce GHG emissions or local 
pollutants as the direct emissions from land transport will be zero, independent of the mode used. However, 
higher numbers of EVs would continue to congest the road, result in accidents, and discourage PT and non-

justified to reduce congestion, save time, reduce car accidents, reduce environmental impacts for required road

BAU Conditional Scenario
The BAU Conditional scenario for land transport has been structured around a target of reducing GHG emissions 
by 30% by 2030 on a conditional basis as outlined in the NDC Implementation Roadmap. This has been extrapolated 
to 2040 and 2050 by having targets of -30% for 2030, -40% for 2040 and -50% for 2050 compared to the extrapolated 
“do-nothing” scenario.
As with the BAU Unconditional scenario, the main mitigation actions for the BAU Conditional scenario include: 
promoting hybrid and electric vehicles, PT, cycling, and biofuels. 
82  I  FIJI LOW EMISSION DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY 2018-2050 FIJI LOW EMISSION DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY 2018-2050  I  83 High Ambition Scenario Figure 35. High Ambition scenario – Land Transport.
The High Ambition scenario for land transport achieves part of the ambition towards full net zero emissions in the 
Very High Ambition scenario. 
As with prior scenarios, the main mitigation actions for the High Ambition scenario include: promoting hybrid and 
electric vehicles, public transport, cycling, and biofuels, as well as efficiency improvement of operating vehicles. 
This scenario envisions gradually increasing the share of new vehicle sales for HEVs and EVs starting in 2020, with 
40% HEV cars, 50% HEV taxis, and 30% HEV buses. By 2030, 20% of cars will be HEVs and 80% cars, 100% taxis, 
100% buses, 100% urban trucks, and 40% large trucks will be EVs. By 2050 HEVs will be completely phased out and 
100% of all cars, taxis, buses, and urban trucks and 70% of large trucks will be EVs.
The scenario also envisions gradually increasing the share of PT to 40% in 2020, 53% by 2030, and 55% by 2050. The 
share of cycling will increase from 1% in 2020 to 15% in 2030 and to 35% by 2050. 
Under the High Ambition scenario (as with the BAU Conditional scenario), Fiji would achieve 5% bioethanol in petrol 
and 2% biodiesel in diesel by 2020, and by 2025 and onward 10% bioethanol in petrol and 5% biodiesel in diesel.
Measures implemented by 2020 under the High Ambition scenario will result in capturing 10% of the total potential, 
and 50% by 2025 and onwards (not all possible measures are expected to be implemented or may only partially be 
implemented).
The emissions resulting from the adoption of mitigation actions under the High Ambition scenario are provided 
in Table 15 below. It is projected that GHG emissions will peak in 2026 and, thereafter, start dropping even with 
increasing GDP and freight and passenger movement. By 2040, the total GHG emissions will be less than that of the

of actions, which can be driven by appropriate policies, regulations and standards, 
alongside public education, awareness and enforcement. 
Biofuels are, in general, more expensive to produce than conventional fuels. However, 
actual cost differences will depend on national circumstances and, thus, need to be 
assessed in detail for Fiji. NMT plans have already been drafted in Fiji. Important steps 
to take in the future will include establishment of safe bike lanes, bike sharing systems 
including e-bikes, and policies for “putting bikes first.” Establishing a large biking 
infrastructure will not have short-term impacts on trip mode shares, but will create 
a culture of biking starting with sports and recreation and moving towards usage 
for daily commuting. Without safe and appropriate infrastructure, this shift cannot 
happen.
Medium-term mitigation actions include adopting EVs and fostering public transport. 
These actions can be planned and trialled in the next few years; on-the-ground 
implementation is not expected in the short-term, but in the period after 2025. 
Fostering PT will require a detailed project plan about what is required and what 
systems are most appropriate. For EVs, it is recommended to develop an EV roadmap 
for Fiji that identifies which vehicle segments and areas to focus on and details the 
intervention strategies and financial means.
As addressed above, long-term mitigation actions include mandating vehicle 
scrapping or maximum vehicle age in coordination with the increased adoption of 
EVs and alternative modes of transport for freight, potentially including rail or coastal 
shipping. The latter could provide alternatives to scrapping trucks. This will need to be 
defined prior to 2030 in order for Fiji to achieve zero emissions by 2050 due to the long 
commercial lifespan of trucks.90
Additional policy measures Fiji would need to consider to achieve these low emission 
scenarios include:

a maritime nation such as Fiji and is interrelated with most domestic economic, social,

reductions must be achieved without compromising safety, access, and affordability of 
maritime transport services. 
Using the Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji (MSAF) ship register, emissions from maritime 
transport are broken down into the following:
•  Government Shipping Service (GSS) vessels;
•  Vessels operating on designated “Uneconomic Routes” – subsidised, privately 
owned shipping that services the “uneconomical routes” as defined by Ministry of 
Infrastructure and Transport (MoIT);
•  Economical vessels – privately owned shipping that services the “economical routes” 
as defined by MoIT;
•  Tourism vessels;
•  Fishing vessels (domestic flagged vessels only);
•  Small boats – under 15 m in length and predominantly powered by outboard motors; 
and 
•  Other vessels – a range of “specialist” vessels such as tugs and dredgers.

the sector. The government must create a complete enabling environment for this 
to happen; the judicious use of economic instruments will be a key tool. Actions to 
initiate preliminary decarbonisation measures for this sector are already contained 
in numerous existing policies; although, to date, these have been implemented 
inconsistently. These policies should be reviewed as the basis for preparing a maritime 
sector action plan. As decarbonisation of this sector must be a long-term process, 
given the long-life expectancy of the primary assets, the foundation must be set early. 
As part of this process, Fiji will need to undertake more concerted efforts to improve 
the accuracy and extent of data collected for the maritime sector. 
Actions for initial implementation include: transitioning 2-stroke engines in small 
vessels to 4-stroke engines (costing USD 0.5-1 million), coupled with a longer-term 
shift to wind and electric hybrids; use of government vessels as demonstration models, 
coupled with financing modality packages to prompt private sector uptake of successful 
trials (costing between USD 10-100 million) and incentivising key market sectors to 
lead in the transition (such as the maritime tourism sector). The inclusion of shoreside 
(port) emissions could be possible if one of two policies were considered in the future. 
The first would be large-scale practice of powering shoreside-stored reefer containers 
from the grid. A much larger impact would result from requiring large berthed vessels 
to use shoreside connections to the grid to provide their power needs (“cold ironing”). 
However, neither of these policies is considered in this LEDS as there would be 
significant impact on electricity sector generation needs and associated investments.
Initial emission reductions can be readily achieved in this sector using existing 
technologies and operational practices at low investment costs. At the same time, 
however, achieving the total reductions required for deep decarbonisation will require 
successful introduction of new and currently commercially unavailable technologies 
and fuels. Details of indicative costs are given in Annex A.

safe, efficient, and effective regulation of air transport in Fiji. It ensures necessary 
compliance with International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards through its 
regulatory arm, the Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji (CAAF). Airports Fiji Limited (AFL), 
renamed Fiji Airports Limited in May 2018, administers the operation of Nadi and 
Nausori International Airports and the operation of 13 other government airports 
throughout Fiji. The government continues to develop the infrastructure of the 15 
airports operated by Fiji Airports Limited including Nadi, Nausori, and Rotuma.105
People rely on domestic airlines to travel within Fiji and to access crucial services. The 
average load factor in the last three years has increased from 50% before 2013 to 70%. 
This improvement is mainly due to the introduction of new planes. Domestic airlines 
play an important role in Fiji’s economic development. Fiji Link Airlines continues to be 
the principal domestic operator. It uses Nadi Airport as its main base but also operates 
flights out of Suva to Levuka, Savusavu, Taveuni, and Kadavu which are in addition to 
their existing operations between Suva to Nadi and Suva to Labasa. Fiji Link Airlines 
also connects Nadi and Suva to Rotuma where the runway has recently been extended 
allowing larger planes to operate. 
Fiji Link has a fleet of two ATR 72-600, one ATR 42-600, and three De Havilland Twin 
Otters.106  Another 100% locally-owned domestic airline, Northern Air, uses Nausori 
Airport as its main base operating a fleet of six aircrafts (one Britten Norman Islander, 
one Britten Norman Trilander BN2, and four Embraer Banderaintes). It offers flights 
to Taveuni, Savusavu, Labasa, Levuka, Moala, and Nadi. It also offers a full charter 
service. 108 Other commercial domestic operators offering non-scheduled services 
include Pacific Island Air, Turtle Airways, Air Wakaya, and Laucala Air. Pacific Island 
Air, which mainly operates seaplanes, is based at Nadi Airport and provides charters 
to island resorts.
4.4.2 Emission Sources
Summary of Emission Sources 
Emissions from domestic aviation are largely the result of the combustion of fossil 
fuel for aircraft operation, such as Jet A1 fuel (kerosene) and Avgas (petrol) fuel. For 
example, Fiji Link’s ATR 72 planes use Jet A1 fuel on flights between Nadi, Suva, and 
Labasa and the De Havilland twin otters use Avgas fuel on all other domestic flights. 
In the Fiji TNC108 to the UNFCCC, total fuel consumption amounted to 1.8 million litres 
of avgas and 3.7 million litres of Jet A1 fuel per annum. For purposes of this LEDS, 
and following the TNC data, these numbers are rounded up to 2.5 million litres and 5.0 
million litres, respectively, to account for fuel use in other aircraft, delays, and charter 
flights.

domestically (rather than exporting wood chips to China). 
In the forestry sector, BAU behaviour and the lack of external financing will leave emissions from afforestation, 
deforestation, and logging relatively unchanged to the year 2050. Under this scenario, the spread in plantation areas 
of African Tulip, an invasive tree species, will reduce the growth of commercial species. It is assumed that measures 
to contain the spread of African Tulip will limit losses in growth (and, thus, in removals) to 5%. Similarly, emissions 
from plantation use will decrease due to the decline in growth.
The BAU Unconditional scenario assumes that emissions in the agricultural sector will remain almost unchanged, 
and that only existing policy measures would be implemented. This will mainly affect livestock farming, as 
breeding programs are expected to improve production from dairy cows and, thus, reduce emissions from enteric 
fermentation. However, as these improvements relate primarily to the commercial sector, the effect on total 
emissions remains small. The decline in rural households will reduce the number of livestock in the subsistence 
sector, accordingly, while at the same time increasing livestock in the commercial sector in order to secure food 
supplies. Thus, this strategy assumes an overall reduction of emissions from enteric fermentation in commercial 
livestock of 1%.
If current practices are largely maintained, emissions from the AFOLU sector will decrease by around 4% to 840 Gg 
COe by 2050 (Table 32).

the total contribution of the forestry sector to the reduction of emissions would, thus, amount to 261 Gg COe.

In the agricultural sector, the technical mitigation potential of livestock farming is being further expanded. 
Assuming external financial support, emissions from enteric fermentation in commercial livestock will be reduced 
by 2%, or 6 Gg COe, by 2050.

Compared to the base year, these assumptions suggest an emission reduction by 210 Gg COe to approximately 660

High Ambition Scenario
In addition to the measures included in the BAU-conditional scenario, Fiji’s high ambition scenario 
includes additional activities to reduce emissions. In the forestry sector, an area of 10,000 ha will 
be reforested with mahogany or equivalent hardwoods by 2050, the MAI of plantations will be 
increase by 30%, and deforestation will be decreased by 20%. Compared to the BY emissions in 
the forestry sector, this will result in an additional 587 Gg COe being removed annually at the end 
2
of the observation period. When afforested stands are harvested at the end of their rotation period, 
the total emission reductions will be decreased by roughly 2%. 
In the agricultural sector, emissions from the use of synthetic fertilisers will be reduced by 1% 
by changing fertiliser rates and types, adjusting the time of application, increasing the precision 
of application, and using inhibitors. In the commercial livestock sector, emissions from enteric 
fermentation will be reduced by 5% and emissions from manure by 2%. 
These measures result in a reduction of the AFOLU sector’s emissions by almost 70% to  
323 Gg (Table 34).

Very High Ambition Scenario
Based on the recommendations of the ER-PIN,153 the very high ambition scenario assumes the afforestation 
of an area of 77,400 ha and the reduction of deforestation by 80%. Through intensive forest management 
measures and tree improvement, the MAI of plantations is increased by 40%, compared to today’s values, 
which seems feasible in view of the growth in comparable regions. In the agricultural sector, emission from 
enteric fermentation and from manure in commercial livestock will be reduced by 10% each and emissions 
from the application of synthetic fertilisers by 1%.

removals of around 826 Gg COe will be achieved. The forestry sector, thus, compensates for all emissions from the 
2
agricultural sector and makes a significant contribution that can be credited to other sectors (Table 35). At a later 
stage, the afforested areas may be harvested. This would result in calculated emissions of about 3-5% of removals.

change mitigation and adaptation. 
The Global Forest Resource Assessment Country Report - Fiji (2015) defines a 
mangrove forest as a “forest occurring below the high tide water mark with a high 
occurrence of mangrove species.” There are eight mangrove plant species in Fiji and 
one hybrid,158 as well as five species and one subspecies of seagrass.159
Seagrass meadows have high biological productivity, recycle nutrients, and play an 
important role in maintaining coastal water quality. They are important foraging areas 
for green turtles and provide nursery habitat for fish, molluscs, and crustaceans that 
support the livelihoods of Fiji’s coastal communities. While the importance of seagrass 
meadows for fisheries is well known, no carbon sequestration studies have been 
carried out, so far, on the seagrass meadows in Fiji. The only data available for carbon 
capture and storage by seagrass areas are based on studies, under comparable 
conditions, in the Indo-Pacific region. Therefore, seagrasses have not been considered 
in this LEDS due to lack of data specific to Fiji. It is recommended that efforts are 
made in the future to collect relevant data on seagrasses in Fiji. 
Similarly, the rich variety of ecosystem goods and services offered by mangroves are 
well documented. These include provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural 
services. The climate regulation service results from the capacity of mangrove soils to 
sequester carbon and act as a carbon sink. Mangrove carbon stocks, by area, exceed 
that of seagrass, tidal marshes, and even rainforests. The global average carbon stock 
of mangroves is estimated at 1,000 tonnes/ha with some 83-99% of it stored in the 
soil,160 compared with the global average carbon stock of the other three ecosystems 
estimated at 100, 400, and 500 tonnes/ha, respectively.161 Logically, then, the GHG 
emissions from mangrove deforestation and degradation are among the highest of all 
land use practices in the tropics.

Base Year (BY)
The base year selected for coastal wetlands in this LEDS is 2013. 
BAU Unconditional Scenario
The BAU Unconditional scenario envisions implementation of policies currently in 
place. The scenario assumes that the total mangroves area in 2008 was 48,317 ha, 
as stated above, and that mangrove removal will take place at a rate of 0.5% per year 
thereafter, resulting in approximately 39,144 ha in 2050. Between the 2013 Base Year

SCC a total of FJD 5,568 cartage tariffs annually.196
This scenario also envisions establishing a waste transfer station. The waste transfer

will also provide an opportunity for recovery of resources, such as recyclables, and 
diversion of organic waste to a composting facility. The fuel data for transportation

2 scenarios.
With a concerted nationwide effort, and with proper planning and implementation, a 
40% reduction in organic waste is feasible. It will require changing the mindset of the 
general public, that not everything should be landfilled, through extensive awareness 
and education. The co-benefit of this action is that it is likely to generate employment 
in the waste sector, particularly at different municipalities and government ministries 
responsible for advocating 3R policies in waste management. This can further be 
encouraged by subsidizing the cost of compost bins or providing incentives for 
reducing waste at the household level, such as by reducing garbage fee collection or 
city rates. In addition, separation at source is also encouraged at the household and 
market level, in addition to separation at landfills, to support composting efforts. In 
the present 2018-2019 budget, FJD 500,000 is allocated to purchase compost bins for 
Nasinu town area.197 If composting waste at a composting facility will be a major driver 
for waste diversion, then a well-developed market for selling compost as a product 
needs to be established.

the cross-cutting issue of emissions from tourism in Fiji’s economy. Tourism has become 
increasingly important to the Fijian economy in recent decades with tourism earnings 
growing from a level of around USD 150 million in 2007 to over USD 800 million in 2016,207 
and contributing significantly to foreign exchange earnings, GDP, and employment.208 In 
2017, a total of 842,884 visitors arrived in Fiji, compared to 792,320 in 2016.209 The NDP 
aims to grow the contribution of tourism to GDP from 15% in 2015 to 20% by 2021. The 
World Travel and Tourism Council expects an overall contribution (indirect, direct, and 
induced) of 41.4% of GDP by 2027.210 To illustrate this point, projected tourist arrivals in Fiji 
through the year 2027 are shown in Figure 77 below.

For demand: Figure 78. Unconditional scenario electricity generation for off-grid hotels.
•  There is a greater implementation of energy efficiency measures than in the high

•  The energy demand is assumed to grow at 0.5% per annum giving rise to almost 
30% reduction in energy demand by 2050 compared to unconditional scenario 
and reducing costs of investment in this scenario compared to the high ambition

For generation:
•  Existing technologies are diesel generators.  This capacity is assumed to be

•  In the future, only new solar PV, and new wind technologies are introduced to meet 
demand.  
The new capacity and investment required for this are outlined in Table 50. As net zero 
emissions (through utilization of renewable electricity) can be reached in the High 
Ambition scenario, the High Ambition and Very High Ambition are similar.

20% under high ambition and almost 30% under very high ambition, which would also 
play a large role in reducing emissions and investments costs for the tourism sector.

Transport for Tourism
Of course, domestic air, land, and maritime transport are also crucial components of 
the tourism sector. This LEDS already includes mitigation actions aimed at promoting 
the decarbonisation of Fiji’s domestic air sector in section 4.4, including extensive use 
of solar energy to power Fiji’s airports as well as other measures. Solarisation of the 
airports would be a very visible action for the domestic air sector. In the land transport 
sector (section 4.2) major emissions reductions will be achieved through the adoption 
of HEVs and EVs. It is envisioned that the tourism sector’s land transport vehicles will 
participate in this transition on the same timeline as the rest of the economy. There 
is, however, an opportunity for the tourism industry to be a first-mover in adoption 
of hybrid and electric vehicles, which can immediately contribute to increasing Fiji’s 
image as a green tourist destination and allow tourism-oriented businesses to

Figure 80 and 81. In reality, the excess electricity generated would be sent to a suitable storage system. The domestic tourism maritime fleet is among the largest for emission sources for

habitats, particularly the restoration of critical riparian and coastal zones, as a 
measure to protect coastlines from extreme weather impacts. The NAP proposes 
enhanced assessment of coastline health. More broadly affecting coastal and inland 
forests alike, the NAP also calls for identifying and mapping “climate vulnerable” 
species of flora and fauna, creating a national plan and monitoring system to support 
climate vulnerable species, and integrated natural and environmental capital in 
national accounting. 
The Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources is working to incorporate a coastal 
vulnerability layer to overlay the mangroves layer of its GIS to assist in identifying 
locations for mangrove replanting, when applications are received from corporate 
bodies as part of their corporate social responsibility initiatives. This is a good example 
of public-private partnerships in the context of climate change adaptation. 
5.5.6 Cross-Cutting Sectors: Tourism
While this LEDS addresses tourism as an important cross-cutting issue (separate 
from IPCC-defined sectors), the NAP considers tourism indirectly. Tourism is of 
particular concern as one of the most significant sectors of the economy, estimated 
to comprise approximately 40% of Fiji’s GDP and employment when measured directly 
and indirectly. 
Figure 84. Percentage share of tourism in Fiji’s economy, in terms of GDP (left) and 
employment (right).252

 SOCIAL, ECONOMIC,   
AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
DIMENSIONS
Tourism supports and provides livelihoods as well as having a vital role in supporting 
the national balance of payments. It is estimated that climate change impacts could 
decrease Fiji’s tourism revenues by 18% by the year 2030.253 Mitigation measures 
considered in this LEDS for tourism will need to align with efforts identified in the 
NAP Framework and the NAP to minimise or eliminate climate risks. For example, 
strengthening conservation measures (such as mangroves) in tourist areas can 
promote sustainable tourism and more climate resilient coastlines.

304 A proposal was recently submitted to Department of Environment by waste clear company. To have the waste transfer station launched and 
operational (basic) it would cost approximately USD 117,000 which mostly includes the cost of the land and minimum infrastructure. To have an enclosed 
waste transfer station, mechanical handling of materials, mechanical sorting of waste and collection and treatment of leachate then it would cost 
approximately USD 705,000. 
305 A proposal was made to WAF by EVO Energy Technologies for power cogeneration for Kinoya. Based on the current capacity of inflow rates a total 
investment of FJD 2.65 million was estimated. Due to the ADB investment and current extension plans at Kinyoa the capacity will almost increase by 
three-fold and therefore the costing is upscaled by a factor of three as well and is estimated to be approximately USD 3.8 million.
