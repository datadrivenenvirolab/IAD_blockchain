Around the world, other green leaders in the industry looked at the impact of the USGBC and decided to start similar movements in their own countries, led by a GBC.[4] Individuals from across the globe were supported by the USGBC. Gottfried seeded and managed the formation of the “United Nations of the Green Building Councils” with the mission of supporting the development of GBCs, and uniting them with a common voice and purpose. In 1999, the founding meeting of WorldGBC was held in California, US. In 2002, WorldGBC was officially formed with eight founding GBCs: Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Japan, Mexico, Spain, and USA. In 2007, a Secretariat for WorldGBC was formally established in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, supported by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority – which continues to work with WorldGBC. Start-up funding of over $1 million per year for three years was provided by the Government of Ontario. Since then, WorldGBC has seen growth and evolution in its focus and structure. In 2009, WorldGBC launched five regional networks and three membership levels (Prospective, Emerging and Established). In 2010 a Corporate Advisory Board was formed to deliver strategic insight from the industry to the WorldGBC Board. By 2012, there were 71 member GBCs. The WorldGBC began to produce reports such as The Business Case for Green Building in 2013[5] and Health, Wellbeing and Productivity in Offices in 2014.[6] In 2015, the WorldGBC Board agreed a new strategic plan for the organisation with five focus areas: Membership; Regional Networks; Projects and Partnerships; Marketing, Communications and Influence; and Governance and Operations. Mission and structure[edit] WorldGBC's mission is to ""create green buildings for everyone, everywhere""[7] - enabling people to thrive both today and tomorrow. WorldGBC has a board of directors,[8] comprising building industry professionals who hold senior positions on the staff or boards of member GBCs (or who are closely affiliated with them). The board's role is to advise and oversee WorldGBC's organisational strategy and governance, and to ensure it is operating effectively as a not for profit organisation and delivering on its mission. Member Green Building Councils[edit] GBCs are independent, non-profit organisations made up of businesses and organisations working in the building and construction industry.[9] As members of WorldGBC, they work to advance green building in their own countries, as well as working with other GBCs to achieve environmental, economic and social goals on a larger, global scale. GBCs are organised into five Regional Networks[10] - powerful, collaborative platforms where they can effectively exchange knowledge, generate new ideas and design solutions that speed up green building in their own markets and across the region. WorldGBC's five main areas are the Americas, Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East and North Africa. Member GBCs also stand at one of WorldGBC's three levels of development: Prospective, Emerging and Established.[11] Corporate Advisory Board[edit] WorldGBC's Corporate Advisory Board is a select group of companies which are leaders on sustainability and which serve to guide WorldGBC on its strategy and activities.[12] The financial support of the Corporate Advisory Board enables WorldGBC to advance green buildings as an effective solution to environmental, social and economic issues, and help member Green Building Councils to grow and flourish. There are currently members of the Corporate Advisory Board: AkzoNobel, City Developments Ltd, JLL, JPMorgan Chase, Keppel Land, Lendlease, Majid Al Futtaim, Philips, Saint-Gobain, Shaw Contract, United Technologies Corporation and Volvo Construction Equipment. Supporters[edit] In addition to its Corporate Advisory Board, WorldGBC has a range of other supporters such as global project sponsors, regional project sponsors, regional partners and pro bono supporters.[13] Staff[edit] WorldGBC has 17 members of staff,[14] based in two main offices, in London and Toronto. The organisation is led by CEO Terri Wills. Five members of staff are regional heads, based in Colombia, Kenya, Singapore, London and Jordan. Activities[edit] Global projects[edit] WorldGBC's global projects enable GBCs to work together to tackle key environmental, economic and societal challenges. Current global projects include 'Advancing Net Zero',[15] which aims to promote and support the acceleration of net zero carbon buildings to 100% by 2050; and 'Better Places for People',[16] which supports GBCs and their members in increasing the demand and supply of green buildings which support the health, wellbeing and productivity of people within them. WorldGBC is also a delivery partner on the 'Building Efficiency Accelerator' (BEA),[17] a partnership of businesses, NGOs and multilateral organisations, which aims to help cities take action to improve their buildings. Regional projects[edit] WorldGBC also has projects which are specific to each of its five regions. Current regional projects include the Energy Efficiency Mortgage Action Plan (EeMAP) initiative[18] in Europe which is exploring the link between energy efficiency and borrower's reduced probability of default and the increase in value of energy efficient properties. World Green Building Week[edit] World Green Building Week[19] is an annual global event led by WorldGBC, its network of more than 70 GBCs and their 49,000 members. Beginning in 2009, the week involves special events promoting public awareness of sustainability and green building around a selected theme: In 2011 World Green Building Week had 129 events in 27 countries on a theme of ""Green Buildings in the New Green Economy"". In 2012, the week had 130 events across 30 countries; the theme was ""Green Buildings for Great Communities"".[20][21] In 2013, the week had 220 events across 33 countries; the theme was ""Greener Buildings, Better Places, Healthier People"".[22] In 2014 the theme was ""Get Up, Green Up,"" which focused on encouraging others to take action on sustainable efforts.[23] 2015's theme was ""Powering Positive Change"". 2016's theme was ""Change Your Perspective"", inviting people to think differently about buildings and how they can have major environmental, economic and societal benefits. 2017's theme was ""Our Hero Is Zero"", which focused on the need to make all buildings net zero by 2050, in line with WorldGBC's Advancing Net Zero project. WorldGBC Congress[edit] Since 2014 WorldGBC has hosted a congress - a gathering of its member councils and an international conference. The congress is jointly organised by WorldGBC and the host country's GBC. Congresses have been held in São Paulo, Brazil (2014), Hong Kong, China (2015), Stockholm, Sweden (2016), and Jaipur, India (2017). The 2018 congress will be in Toronto, Canada,[24] and 2019's will be in Paris, France.[25] WorldGBC awards[edit] WorldGBC presents two major annual awards recognising the contributions of individuals to the global green building movement.[26] The Chairman's Award is given to individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to the global green building movement, while the David Gottfried Award is presented to individuals whose contribution to the global green building movement has been shown to be unique, innovative and entrepreneurial. These awards are presented at the WorldGBC Congress. WorldGBC also hosts the Asia Pacific Regional Network Awards every two years,[27] and supports the MENA Green Building Awards.[28] Partnership[edit] WorldGBC has a partnership with the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction.[29] It aims to gather the support of countries, cities and public and private organisations to ensure the sector helps to meet the Paris Agreement and global goals on climate change. WorldGBC sits on the interim steering committee of the Alliance, developing strong governance to support the 24 countries and 72 non-state organisations which are affiliated with it. Impact[edit] In December 2017, WorldGBC published its latest annual report,[30] outlining the achievements of the organisation and its global network of GBCs over the previous year. These include 1.24 billion m2 of green building space around the world that has been certified by member Green Building Councils; five new net zero building certifications launched by GBCs through the Advancing Net Zero project; and 31 countries making green building policy changes at either the city, regional or national level, with contributions from GBC.

In 2012, the week had 130 events across 30 countries; the theme was ""Green Buildings for Great Communities"".[20][21] In 2013, the week had 220 events across 33 countries; the theme was ""Greener Buildings, Better Places, Healthier People"".[22] In 2014 the theme was ""Get Up, Green Up,"" which focused on encouraging others to take action on sustainable efforts.[23] 2015's theme was ""Powering Positive Change"". 2016's theme was ""Change Your Perspective"", inviting people to think differently about buildings and how they can have major environmental, economic and societal benefits. 2017's theme was ""Our Hero Is Zero"", which focused on the need to make all buildings net zero by 2050, in line with WorldGBC's Advancing Net Zero project. WorldGBC Congress[edit] Since 2014 WorldGBC has hosted a congress - a gathering of its member councils and an international conference. The congress is jointly organised by WorldGBC and the host country's GBC. Congresses have been held in São Paulo, Brazil (2014), Hong Kong, China (2015), Stockholm, Sweden (2016), and Jaipur, India (2017).

Introduction There are different categories of membership within the WMA: Constituent Membership – This category of members is typically represented by National Associations of Physicians from different countries in the world. Such associations are broadly representative of the physicians of their country by virtue of their membership, with their voting membership being limited to physicians and medical students. They are not subject to, or controlled by, any office or agency of government. Associate Membership – Individual physicians can join the WMA as Associate Members, with voting rights at the Annual Associate Members Meeting and the right to participate in the General Assembly through the chosen representatives of the Associate Members. Other classes of Membership can also be established by the Assembly, should it be appropriate and in the best interest of the WMA. Benefits of Membership Recognition and acceptance as a member of an international organization such as the WMA lends tremendous credibility to a National Medical Association (NMA). This is particularly true when there is more than one professional association representing physicians in a country. The WMA is in official relations with United Nations agencies such as the World Health Organization, which gives NMAs and Associate Members access to these world bodies. By participating in the debate with colleagues from all over the world, NMAs and Associate Members have the opportunity to provide the world with valuable ethical guidance and leadership in health care. Information and knowledge can be sourced from the WMA, which can contribute to the optimal efficacy of NMAs and individual physicians. NMAs and Associate Members can make use of the WMA’s products and services.

(January 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) World Medical AssociationWMA logoFounded18 September 1947LocationFerney-Voltaire, FranceMembers 115 Constituent Members and 1467 Associate Members (2021)Key peopleDr. David Barbe (President), Prof. Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery (Chairperson of Council)Websitewww.wma.net The World Medical Association (WMA) is an international and independent confederation of free professional medical associations representing physicians worldwide. WMA was formally established on September 18, 1947[1] and has grown to 115 national medical associations, as of 2021, with 1467 Associate Members, including Junior Doctors and medical students. [2][3] and more than 10 million physicians. WMA is in official relations with the World Health Organization (WHO) and seeks close collaboration with the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to physical and mental health. Contents 1 History 2 Governance 2.1 General Assembly 2.2 Council 3 Secretariat 4 Official languages 5 Membership 6 Projects 7 Controversies 8 See also 9 References 10 External links History[edit] The WMA was founded on 18 September 1947, when physicians from 27 different countries met at the First General Assembly of the WMA in Paris. This organization was built from an idea born in the House of the British Medical Association in 1945, within a meeting organized in London to initiate plans for an international medical organization to replace l'Association Professionnelle Internationale des Médecins"", which had suspended its activities because of World War II.[1] In order to facilitate financial support from its member associations, in 1948, the executive board, known as the Council, established the Secretariat of the WMA in New York City in order to provide close liaison with the United Nations and its various agencies. The WMA Secretariat remained in New York City until 1974 when for reasons of economy, and in order to operate within the vicinity of Geneva-based international organizations (WHO, ILO, ICN, ISSA, etc.) it was transferred to its present location in Ferney-Voltaire, France. The WMA members gathered in an annual meeting, which from 1962 was named ""World Medical Assembly."" Since its beginning WMA has shown concern over the state of medical ethics in general and over the world, and worked on a modernized wording of the ancient oath of Hippocrates, which was sent for consideration at the II General Assembly in Geneva in 1948. The medical vow was adopted and the Assembly agreed to name it the ""Declaration of Geneva."" Also in the same II General Assembly a report on ""War Crimes and Medicine"" was received. This prompted the Council to appoint another Study Committee to prepare an International Code of Medical Ethics, which after an extensive discussion, was adopted in 1949 by the III General Assembly. Governance[edit] General Assembly[edit] The main decision-making body of the WMA is the General Assembly, which meets annually and is formed by delegations from the National Member Associations, officers and members of the Council of the WMA, and representatives of the Associate Members (Associate Members are individual physicians who wish to join the WMA). Council[edit] The Assembly elects the WMA Council every two years with representatives drawn from each of the six WMA regions, namely Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America and the Pacific. It also elects the WMA president annually, who is the Ceremonial Head of the WMA. The President, President Elect and Immediate Past President form the Presidium that is available to speak for the WMA and represent it officially. Every two years, the WMA Council, excluding the Presidium, elects a Chairperson who is the political head of the organization. As Chief Executive of the operational units of the WMA, the Secretary-General is in full-time employment at the Secretariat, appointed by the WMA Council. Secretariat[edit] The WMA Secretariat is situated in Ferney-Voltaire, France, adjacent to the City of Geneva. Since 2005, Dr. Otmar Kloiber is the Secretary-General. Official languages[edit] English, French, and Spanish are the official languages of the association since its creation. Membership[edit] Map showing the 112 WMA Constituent Members The WMA have the following status of membership: Constituent Membership: Mainly applies for members who are typically National Associations of Physicians from different countries in the world (sometimes these organizations are called National Medical Associations).[4] Such associations are broadly representative of the physicians of their country by virtue of their membership. They range from chambers to orders, from colleges to private associations. Some of these have compulsory membership and some are trade unions. Associate Membership: Applies for Individual physicians that want to join the WMA and who have voting rights at the Annual Associate Members Meeting and the right to participate in the General Assembly through the chosen representatives of the Associate Members. See more information on Membership by clicking on the following link (WMA Membership): Projects[edit] The WMA is active in several areas of action,[5] but mainly in: Advocacy Ethics Health Systems Human Rights Public Health In what concerns Ethics, the WMA has various Declarations, Resolutions and Statements with which tries to help to guide National Medical Associations, governments and international organizations throughout the world. A wide range of subjects are covered like the rights of patients, research on human subjects, care of the sick and wounded in times of armed conflict, torture of prisoners, the use and abuse of drugs, family planning and pollution.[6] WMA also works on: Medical education Human resources planning for health care services Patient safety Leadership and career development Advocacy for physicians' and patients' rights Occupational health and safety Democracy building for new medical associations Public health policy Projects such as tobacco control and immunization The WMA also works on Education Programs such as the prison-medicine course, the MDR-TB and the TB refresher course, the ethics course and the course on microbial resistance (together with the George Mason University and the International Society for Microbial Resistance). The WMA Medical Ethics Manual The World Medical and Health Policy Journal Caring Physicians of the World Controversies[edit] During the World Medical Association General Assembly in Reykjavik in early October 2018, members of the Canadian Medical Association stated that parts of the speech by WMA's incoming president Leonid Eidelman had been plagiarized from a speech made in 2014 by Chris Simpson (cardiologist) who was then the president of CMA. Current president Dr. Gigi Osler told the group that part of the address was ""copied word for word"" from Simpson's speech. ""Multiple other parts of the speech were also copied from various websites, blogs and news articles, without proper appropriate attribution to the authors"", she latter added in a statement. A motion by Canada at the Assembly to call on Eidelman to resign was not successful.[7] On 6 October, the CMA resigned; their press release stated that the decision was made because WMA was not upholding ethical standards.[8] In an email to The Canadian Press, WMA spokesman Nigel Duncan said that Eidelman's speech had been written by others and that he did not know that it might contain plagiarism.[7] A WMA source also told The Canadian Press that Eidelman apologized at the general assembly, after the Canadian delegates had departed; he ""acknowledge[d] that part of his speech was taken from Simpson"", and most delegates ""accepted his apology"" for the mistake.[9][10] See also[edit] Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) Declaration of Geneva Declaration of Helsinki Declaration of Tokyo.

Google Maps click to enlarge Satellite image of La Palma Correctional Center, where Aamir Sheikh went on hunger strike. Google Maps Immigration officials sought and received permission from a federal court to force-feed a Pakistani national who went on a hunger strike more than two weeks ago at a private Eloy detention center, but the potential treatment has been called torture by the United Nations. Aamir Hafiz Sheikh started refusing meals on March 10 out of frustration that Pakistani officials have not provided a travel document he needs for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deport him. Sheikh claimed to medical staffers that he intermittently drank sips of water, but officials have not observed him doing so. He was ordered deported by an immigration judge on May 3, 2018, and the 44-year-old immigrant has been detained at La Palma Correctional Facility since August 27, 2018. Sheikh, who owned businesses in Phoenix and Mesa, was convicted of food stamp fraud in 2015. Three days into his hunger strike, Sheikh was treated for dehydration and stomach inflammation at Banner Casa Grande Medical Center. Sheikh has refused medical monitoring since his hospital visit, according to federal officials.

Support Us Keep New Times Free. Support Us “Due to the inability to assess his exact medical state, there is concern of Mr. Sheikh going into renal failure, liver failure, or becoming comatose due to dehydration and hypotension, which could lead to his death,"" wrote first assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Strange. The federal government sought an emergency order to ""administer necessary hydration and nutritional supplements"" to Sheikh. U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa then issued an order on March 22 granting ICE authority to force-feed Sheikh through a nasal tube or intravenous line. Humetewa's order also allows ICE to restrain Sheikh if he refuses to cooperate and perform involuntary medical examinations on him. A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a question asking whether the agency has force-fed Sheikh or whether he is still on a hunger strike. Sheikh does not appear to be represented by an attorney, according to federal court records. ICE drew international attention in January when it used nasal tubes to force-feed nine hunger-striking Indian nationals in El Paso, Texas. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a statement suggesting the practice could constitute a violation of the UN Convention Against Torture. ICE stopped force-feeding the El Paso detainees in February, Texas Monthly reported. The practice of force-feeding inmates through a nasal tube is controversial in the medical field. The American Medical Association opposed the practice when it was used on detainees at Guantanamo Bay, saying, “Force feeding of detainees violates core ethical values of the medical profession.” The World Medical Association has also condemned force-feeding. Liz Martinez, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Freedom for Immigrants, said that there have been more than 1,400 cases of immigrant detainees going on hunger strikes since the group began keeping track of such cases in May 2015. Martinez said she only knows of one other case, which took place in Georgia in 2017, in which a federal court granted permission for ICE to force-feed a detainee via nasal tube. Immigrant-advocacy groups have recently argued in a case in Tacoma, Washington, that hunger-striking constitutes constitutionally protected free speech and that force-feeding violates that right. ""It’s not only a violation of the First Amendment, but also medically unethical and barbaric,"" Martinez said in a phone interview. ""It’s extremely painful."" La Palma Correctional Center, the private prison where Sheikh is being held, is owned by CoreCivic. The facility started housing immigrant detainees in July, after CoreCivic entered into a contract with the federal government. Before then, the prison mostly took convicts from California. The immigrant-rights organization Puente claimed in September that more than 100 immigrant detainees at La Palma started a hunger strike in September, demanding regular access to bathrooms and showers and three meals a day. A spokesperson for ICE, however, told local National Public Radio affiliate KJZZ at the time that there was no hunger strike. Sheikh's most recent hunger strike is his fourth, according to an affidavit submitted by Dr. William Crane, a physician at La Palma. The Pakistani national also went on hunger strikes from November 26 to December 4, from January 22 to February 1, and from March 6 to 9. All of those strikes ended with Sheikh eating, Crane testified.

OUTLAW OCEAN MUSIC PROJECT: WHERE MUSIC MEETS JOURNALISM All music in this project is based on THE OUTLAW OCEAN, a New York Times best-selling book by Ian Urbina that chronicles lawlessness at sea around the world. The reporting touches on a diversity of abuses ranging from illegal and overfishing, arms trafficking at sea, human slavery, gun-running, intentional dumping, murder of stowaways, thievery of ships, and other topics. The music is an act of solidarity across geography and language, and an attempt at storytelling from written word to music. It is a captivating collection of inspired songs.

WOSM was established in 1920, and has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. It is the counterpart of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS). The mission of WOSM is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Scout Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.[1] WOSM is organized into regions and operates with a conference, committee and bureau.

The World Scout Conference is the general assembly of Scouting and is composed of six delegates from each of the member Scout associations. If a country has more than one association, the associations form a federation for coordination and world representation. The basis for recognition and membership in the World Scout Conference includes adherence to the aims and principles of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, and independence from political involvement on the part of each member association.[2] The Conference meets every three years and is hosted by a member association. At the World Scout Conference basic cooperative efforts are agreed upon and a plan of mutual coordination is adopted. The Conference directed the move of the World Scout Bureau from Ottawa, Canada to Geneva on May 1, 1968.[3] Date Number Location Member Countries 1920 First World Scout Conference London 33 1922 Second World Scout Conference Paris 32 1924 Third World Scout Conference Copenhagen 34 1926 Fourth World Scout Conference Kandersteg 29 1929 Fifth World Scout Conference Birkenhead 33 1931 Sixth World Scout Conference Baden bei Wien 44 1933 Seventh World Scout Conference Gödöllő 31 1935 Eighth World Scout Conference Stockholm 28 1937 Ninth World Scout Conference The Hague 34 1939 10th World Scout Conference Edinburgh 27 1947 11th World Scout Conference Château de Rosny-sur-Seine 27 1949 12th World Scout Conference Elvesaeter 25 1951 13th World Scout Conference Salzburg 34 1953 14th World Scout Conference Vaduz 35 1955 15th World Scout Conference Niagara Falls, Ontario 44 1957 16th World Scout Conference Cambridge 52 1959 17th World Scout Conference New Delhi 35 1961 18th World Scout Conference Lisbon 50 1963 19th World Scout Conference Rhodes 52 1965 20th World Scout Conference Mexico City 59 1967 21st World Scout Conference Seattle 70 1969 22nd World Scout Conference Otaniemi 64 1971 23rd World Scout Conference Tokyo 71 1973 24th World Scout Conference Nairobi 77 1975 25th World Scout Conference Lundtoft 87 1977 26th World Scout Conference Montreal 81 1979 27th World Scout Conference Birmingham 81 1981 28th World Scout Conference Dakar 74 1983 29th World Scout Conference Dearborn 90 1985 30th World Scout Conference Munich 93 1988 31st World Scout Conference Melbourne 77 1990 32nd World Scout Conference Paris 1993 33rd World Scout Conference Sattahip 1996 34th World Scout Conference Oslo 108 1999 35th World Scout Conference Durban 116 2002 36th World Scout Conference Thessaloniki 126 2005 37th World Scout Conference Hammamet 122 2008 38th World Scout Conference Jeju-do 150 2011 39th World Scout Conference Curitiba World Scout Committee 1939-1955 version of the World Scout Emblem, used by the World Scout Committee The World Scout Committee is the chief executive body of the World Scout Conference and is composed of elected volunteers. The World Scout Committee represents World Scout Conference between the meetings of the full conference. The World Scout Committee is responsible for the implementation of the resolutions of the World Scout Conference and for acting on its behalf between its meetings. The Committee meets twice a year, usually in Geneva, Switzerland. Its Steering Committee, consisting of the Chairman, two Vice-Chairmen and the Secretary General, meet as needed.[4] The Committee is composed of 14 members. Twelve, each from a different country, are elected for six-year terms by the World Scout Conference. The members, elected without regard to their nationality, do not represent their country but the interests of the Movement as a whole. The Secretary General and the Treasurer of WOSM are ex-officio members of the Committee. The chairmen of the regional Scout committees participate in the World Scout Committee meetings in a consultative capacity.[5] The World Scout Committee has set up work streams to address the top strategic priorities, as defined by the World Scout Conference, which at present include: * Youth involvement * Volunteers in Scouting * Scouting's profile (communications, partnerships, resources) Standing committees include: * Audit * Budget * Constitutions * Honours and Awards *Working With Others- a consultative committee of the WOSM and the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), composed of members of the World Committee/World Board of both organizations * 2007 Task Force for the 100th Anniversary of Scouting, composed of members of the World Scout Committee, World Scout Bureau, World Scout Foundation, and The Scout Association of the United Kingdom Current members of the World Scout Committee Name Country Term to William F.

It was first awarded to Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell by a unanimous decision of the then-International Committee on the day of the institution of the Bronze Wolf in Stockholm in 1935. World Scout Bureau The World Scout Bureau is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland and has offices in six regional divisions: Template:Legend Template:Legend Template:Legend Template:Legend Template:Legend Template:Legend Template:Legend The World Scout Bureau (WSB, formerly the International Bureau) is the secretariat that carries out the instructions of the World Scout Conference and the World Scout Committee. The WSB is administered by the secretary general, who is supported by a small staff of technical resource personnel. The bureau staff helps associations improve and broaden their Scouting by training professionals and volunteers, establishing finance policies and money-raising techniques, improving community facilities and procedures, and assisting in marshaling the national resources of each country behind Scouting.[6] The staff also helps arrange global events such as the World Scout Jamborees, encourages regional events, and acts as a liaison between the Scouting movement and other international organizations. A major effort in the emerging nations is the extension of the universal Good Turn into an organization-wide effort for community development.[7] The World Organization of the Scout Movement is associated with the three World Scout Centres. The World Scout Jamboree is held roughly every four years under the auspices of the WOSM, with members of WAGGGS also invited. WOSM also organises the World Scout Moot, a Jamboree for 17-26 year olds, and has organised the World Scout Indaba, a gathering for Scout leaders. The World Scout Foundation is a perpetual fund governed by a separate Board of Governors and supported by donations for the development of Scouting programs throughout the world. The WOSM is the non-governmental organization (NGO), that represents the Scouting movement at the United Nations.[8] The WOSM and WAGGGS both have General Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council ECOSOC of the United Nations.[9] World Scout Centres World Scout Centre is a brand of the WOSM and actually used by three Scouting facilities in different countries. These facilities are operated by the corresponding regional divisions or by independent bodies: * Kandersteg International Scout Centre in Switzerland, operated by the Scouts International Home association * Cairo International Scout Centre in Egypt, operated by the Arab Region * Picarquín World Scout Centre in Chile, operated by the Interamerican Region Badge The WOSM membership badge, called the World Crest, is a purple, circular badge with a fleur-de-lis in the center, surrounded by a piece of rope tied with a reef knot (also called a square knot). The fleur-de-lis is an ancient symbol, originally used by Baden-Powell for the enlisted scouts of the British Army and subsequently adopted and modified for Scouting. The arrowhead represents the North point on a compass, and is intended to point Scouts on the path to service and unity. The three points on the fleur-de-lis represent the three duties, to God, self and others. The two five-point stars stand for truth and knowledge, with the ten points representing the ten points of the Scout Law (see below). The bond at the base of the fleur-de-lis shows the family of Scouting. The encircling rope symbolizes the unity and family of the World Scout Movement. History As a result of the first World Scout Jamboree at Olympia, London in 1920, leaders there created the Boy Scouts' International Conference. All 31 nations represented at Olympia were the charter members. A Bureau was established at 25, Buckingham Palace Road, London, and the then United Kingdom International Commissioner, Hubert S. Martin, was appointed as Honorary Director. The Boy Scouts' International Conference was later superseded by the World Scout Conference. The needs of Scout youth in unusual situations has created some interesting permutations, answerable directly to the World Scout Bureau. For years there was an active Boy Scouts of the United Nations with several troops at Parkway Village in New York City, with but 14 members in 1959. Also directly registered to the World Bureau were the 900 member International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone,[10] as well as 84 Scouts of the European Coal and Steel Community, an early precursor to the European Union. Publication: Scouting 'round the World, 1977 edition Publications Publications of WOSM include: * Scouting 'Round the World: a book updated every three years with details on all WOSM member organizations; * WorldInfo: a monthly circular distributed in electronic format with the help of Scoutnet.

You are hereHome / National Scout Organizations National Scout Organizations Scouting is a global movement with over 54 million Scouts worldwide, all part of recognised National Scout Organizations (NSOs) of WOSM (also known as Member Organizations). The role of the NSO is to support and develop Scouting in that country, and facilitate contacts with other NSOs and the World Organization. To become a member of WOSM, NSOs must gain recognition from the World Scout Conference. There can only be one NSO per country. In the case of a country having more than one National Scout Association (NSA), a federation is formed for the purpose of national coordination and world membership. There are currently 172 Member Organizations in the world. In addition to the 172 Member Organizations, local Scouting activities exist in at least another 52 countries and territories worldwide. List of National Scout Organizations Membership figures Below you can find the membership census as of the World Organization of the Scout Movement.

"Africa Scout Region (World Organization of the Scout Movement) - Wikipedia Africa Scout Region (World Organization of the Scout Movement) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Divisional office of the World Scout Bureau headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya African Scout RegionMap of members or potential members of the African Scout RegionOwnerWorld Organization of the Scout MovementHeadquartersNairobi, Kenya Websitehttp://scout.org/africa Scouting portal The Africa Scout Region is the divisional office of the World Scout Bureau of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya, with satellite offices in Cape Town, South Africa, and Dakar, Senegal. The Africa Region services Scouting in Sub-Saharan Africa and neighboring islands that are recognized members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). Currently, the region has 39 member National Scout Associations/Organizations and 11 potential members. There are about one million registered Scouts in Africa, though it is suspected that there are about twice that number in the region. The large nations of Mali, Guinea-Bissau and the Central African Republic, and several smaller nations, are not yet WOSM members, for various reasons. This region is the counterpart of the Africa Region of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS). Contents 1 History 2 Africa Network Scout Fellowship 3 All-Africa Region Scout Jamborees 4 See also 5 References 6 External links History[edit] On 13 March 1963, Scout leaders from around the region met for the first time in Lagos, Nigeria to discuss the organization of the Africa Scout Region. At the 62nd ordinary session of the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on 21-23 June 1995, declared 13 March the Africa Scout Day.[citation needed] Africa Network Scout Fellowship[edit] The Africa Network Scout Fellowship is a forum where members of the United Kingdom Scout Association with a specific interest in Africa can share knowledge, ideas and experiences. It promotes the expansion of international Scouting, with a particular focus on building friendships in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Collectively the Africa Network Scout Fellowship members have experience in Angola, Botswana, Cameroon, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The Africa Network Scout Fellowship assists all sections of the Scout Movement, in a variety of activities-whitewater rafting, community initiatives, mountaineering, construction projects and safari adventures. The Africa Network Scout Fellowship actively promotes expeditions to all parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and help on all aspects of an expedition, from initial planning, to British training camps, to the actual expedition itself. Africa Network Scout Fellowship meetings are held at varying locations throughout the United Kingdom. All-Africa Region Scout Jamborees[edit] Main article: Africa Scout Jamboree The Region has run or sponsored region-wide jamborees in its member countries.

The World Organization of the Scout Movement recognises at most one member organisation per country. Some countries have several organisations combined as a federation, with different component groups divided on the basis of religion (e.g., France and Denmark), ethnic identification (e.g., Bosnia-Herzegovina), or language (e.g., Belgium). All the formerly communist states of Central and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have developed or are developing Scouting in the wake of the renaissance in the region. These include Albania, Bulgaria, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the successor states to Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and the Baltic nations independent of the former Soviet Union. Of these, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary have been most successful in regrowing their Scout movements and are very well-developed, thanks in part to the existence of Scouts-in-Exile movements for the diaspora of each nation.

Its purposes are: To further the Scout Movement within the European Scout Region by promoting the spirit of world brotherhood, cooperation and mutual assistance amongst Scout associations within the Region; To foster the idea of a European citizenship, based on the conscience of a common heritage and destiny; To develop cooperation among European youth; To ensure proper implementation of the decisions and policies laid down by the World Organization of the Scout Movement, which affect the European Scout Region. The 20th European Scout Conference was hosted by Guidisme et Scoutisme en Belgique and was held in Brussels, Belgium, from 17 to 21 July 2010. The 21st European Scout Conference is scheduled to take place in Berlin, Germany, in August 2013, hosted by the Ring Deutscher Pfadfinderverbände. European Regional Scout Committee[edit] The European Regional Scout Committee is the executive body of the European Regional Scout Conference and is composed of six elected volunteer members. The functions of the European Regional Scout Committee are: To put into effect the resolutions of the European Regional Scout Conference and to fulfill any duty the European Regional Scout Conference may assign to it; To fulfill tasks the Constitution of the World Organization of the Scout Movement assigns to it; To act as an advisory body to the World Scout Committee; To act as an advisory body for member organisations of the European Scout Region requiring advice and assistance. The members of the European Regional Scout Committee are elected for a three-year term by the European Regional Scout Conference, and may be re-elected for an immediate second term. The members, elected without regard to their nationality, do not represent their country or National Scout Organisation but the interests of the Scout Movement as a whole, similar to Members of the World Scout Committee. The Regional Director (professional position) and the Treasurer of the European Scout Region (volunteer position) are ex-officio members of the European Regional Scout Committee. The Chairman of the European Scout Foundation also regularly attends meetings of the European Regional Scout Committee. European Regional Scout Office[edit] The European Regional Scout Office serves as secretariat of the European Scout Region and is one of six Regional Offices of the World Scout Bureau, the secretariat of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. A Regional Director heads the European Regional Scout Office and is assisted by a number of professional staff. Currently, the European Regional Scout Office has offices in Geneva, Switzerland and Brussels, Belgium. Additional out-offices are situated in Belgrade, Serbia and Veles, North Macedonia. European Regional Scout Plan 2010–2013[edit] In 2010, the 20th European Scout Conference adopted the European Regional Scout Plan 2010–2013, which summarises the Region's main areas of work, objectives and action planned for the triennium 2010–2013. Working Groups and Core Groups[edit] In order to achieve the objectives set out by the European Regional Scout Plan 2010–2013, five thematic Working Groups and three supporting Core Groups were set up in December 2010, composed of volunteers from different member organisations of the European Scout Region and supported by members of the European Regional Scout Committee and the European Regional Scout Office. Working Groups: Growth through Quality Volunteering Embracing Change Youth Empowerment Partnerships with other Regions Core Groups: Educational Methods (including Youth Programme and Adult Resources) Organisational Development External Relations and Funding Regional Scouts administered directly by WOSM[edit] The needs of Scout youth in unusual situations has created some interesting permutations, answerable directly to the World Scout Bureau. For years there was an active Boy Scouts of the United Nations in Geneva, as well as 84 Scouts of the European Coal and Steel Community, an early precursor to the European Union. Cooperation[edit] As one of the six geographical subdivisions of the World Organization of the Scout Movement the European Scout Region developed close relationships with a number of other Regions, in particular with the Arab Scout Region, the Africa Scout Region and the Eurasia Scout Region. The European Scout Region also supports multilateral and bilateral relationships between National Scout Organisations of the European Scout Region with Scout associations of other Regions. This region is the counterpart of the Europe Region of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS). The European Scout Region has a strong relationship with the Europe Region of WAGGGS. To further develop their relationship, the two Regions had a Joint Regional Office during the late 1990s in Brussels, Belgium, which was closed again in 1998. An informal Joint Regional Committee composed of the two Regional Committees continues to discuss matters of mutual interest and supports the planning and running of joint youth activities and training events.[citation needed] The two Regions also maintain a Joint Communication Platform (Europak), which provides information for member organisations of the European Scout Region and the Europe Region WAGGGS. Together published a monthly newsletter called Eurofax (this newsletter was already published by the European Scout Office before the joint office was opened, and reverted to WOSM when the joint office closed. The European Scout Region represents the World Organization of the Scout Movement in a number of relevant inter-governmental institutions as well as non-governmental platforms in Europe. This includes, in particular, the European Youth Forum (YFJ), which operates within the Council of Europe and European Union areas and works closely with these two bodies. It is also represented in the Advisory Council on Youth of the Council of Europe and has regular contacts with relevant institutions of the European Union. A WOSM joint Eurasian-and-European Scout meeting was held in Kyiv in April 2009. Activities[edit] The European Scout Region offers a number of sharing and training activities for its member organizations, a number of which are organised jointly with the Europe Region of WAGGGS. The main purpose of these activities is to provide opportunities for sharing and exchanging of experiences and best practices as well as training for adult volunteers and professionals involved in Scouting. Among regularly held events are: The Academy – an annual sharing and training event for Scout and Guide associations in Europe The Symposium – held every three years in preparation of the European Scout Conference The Chief Volunteers and Chief Executives Meetings – networking events for people occupying similar positions The International Commissioners Forum – sharing and networking event held in preparation of the European Scout and Guide Conference Training Commissioners Meeting – networking event for people occupying similar positions Education Methods Forum – sharing and networking event for people involved in Youth Programme and/or Adult Resources The European Scout Region also supports informal networks of member organisations of the European Scout Region which provide platforms for dialogue and exchange in specific areas: North-South Network – development and support of partnership projects between NSOs in Europe and, in particular, Africa Overture Network – sharing and networking of NSOs working in the area of diversity Odysseus Group (European Sea Scouting Network) – sharing, networking and training of NSOs engaged in Sea Scouting European Scout Jamboree[edit] Main article: European Scout Jamboree The European Region of WOSM was the organizer of the European Scout Jamboree, which has been organized twice, in both cases as a dry run for a World Scout Jamboree organized in the same country within a few years. European jamborees were open to youth between the ages of 11 and 17, however many adults are involved as Scout leaders or as members of the IST (International Service Team), Past European Scout Jamborees include: 1st European Scout Jamboree in Dronten, The Netherlands, 1994 2nd European Scout Jamboree in Hylands Park (Chelmsford, United Kingdom), 2005 The European Jamboree 2020, a joint event between WOSM and WAGGGS' European Regions, was planned to take place on Sobieszewo Island, in Gdańsk, Poland, with a target of 30,000 participants. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event was initially postponed in April 2020 to summer of 2021, before being cancelled in November 2020. Roverway[edit] Roverway is a joint activity of the European Region of WOSM and the Europe Region of WAGGGS, a ten-day event open for youth aged 16 to 22, who are members of the senior branches of member organisations of WOSM or WAGGGS. The activity was introduced in 2003 (as a follow-up to the Eurofolk event that existed from 1977 to 1997) and consists usually of two stages: a ""journey"" with small units of Scouts making their way to the main camp, which is the second stage. Roverway is usually held every three years and hosted by a member organisation of the European Scout Region: Roverway 2003 in Leiria, Portugal; motto ""People in motion"" Roverway 2006 in Florence, Italy; motto: ""Dare to share"" Roverway 2009 in Úlfljótsvatn Scout Center, Iceland; motto: ""Open up"" Roverway 2012 in Evo, Hämeenlinna, National Campsite of the Guides and Scouts of Finland, Finland; motto: ""See. Feel. Follow"" Roverway 2016 in France; 2015 was skipped as not to overlap the 23rd World Scout Jamboree, per decision of the March 2011 meeting of the Joint Committee;[6] motto: ""Sur la Route"", which translates 'On the Road"". Roverway 2018 in the Netherlands; motto: ""Opposites Attract"" Non-WOSM European Scouting[edit] Two other multinational Europe-specific Scout organizations exist, not linked to WOSM, the only geographic area to have such.

Such support pays dividends by reducing the severity and costs of climate impacts for people, including extreme weather, ecosystem loss and societal instability both at home and abroad. Over the last four years (see our coverage from 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020), Congress has sought to maintain U.S. finance for international climate action, in the face of repeated efforts by the Trump administration to drastically cut funding back. But while the United States has been treading water on climate finance, the rest of the world has moved ahead, and the climate crisis is only intensifying. In 2009, developed countries made a collective commitment to mobilize $100 billion a year in climate finance for developing countries between 2020 and 2025. As the largest cumulative greenhouse gas emitter, the United States has not been doing its fair share towards this goal. It is time for the United States to not just catch up, but to lead on climate finance — for the country's own sake as well as for others'. Climate change is a global phenomenon with significant local implications. Over the past five years, the United States has suffered $600 billion in direct losses from climate and weather-related events. Yet just $2.5 billion, or 0.07% of the federal budget each year, supports international efforts to address climate change. President Joe Biden has made climate change a top priority, and this week his Special Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, told the international community ""we intend to make good on our climate finance pledge."" Biden's recent Executive Order, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, charged his team to develop a climate finance plan in the next three months. There are four key areas of climate finance that the administration should prioritize to bolster U.S. influence and impact as it reengages in global climate action. International Climate Finance in the 2021 Funding Bill First, it's important to look at what the fiscal year 2021 spending package passed by Congress in December 2020 did for international climate funding. This provides the baseline from which the Biden administration must build. $811 million in bilateral allocations for environmental programs addressing biodiversity protection, sustainable landscapes, renewable energy and adaptation: Congress directed that at least $811 million in bilateral assistance — given directly to other governments — be used for environmental objectives, a $5 million increase compared to fiscal year 2020. These amounts, which come primarily from the Development Assistance and the Economic Support Fund, are similar to the Obama administration's spending. But whereas President Obama voluntarily supported these areas, starting in fiscal year 2020 Congress enshrined renewable energy and adaptation as new mandatory lines in the spending bills (alongside existing lines for sustainable landscapes and biodiversity) to prevent the Trump administration from cutting them. $140 million for the Global Environment Facility: This international fund has financed projects that help developing countries meet commitments under a variety of global environmental agreements for 29 years, and has enjoyed long-standing bipartisan support in Congress. Despite the Trump administration's repeated efforts to halve U.S. contributions, Congress has maintained Global Environment Facility funding over the past four years. $1.48 billion for multilateral development banks: These banks are significant sources of climate finance for developing countries, providing $46 billion in climate finance in 2019. The United States is a major shareholder in these institutions. Funding for 2021 was one area where the Trump administration and Congress were in full agreement. $32 million for the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund: This fund helps developing countries reduce their use of ozone-depleting chemicals, which include several powerful greenhouse gases. The United States maintained funding at the same level as last year. $6.4 million for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC): These UN entities support climate science and international negotiations, respectively. The United States provides around two-fifths of the IPCC's total budget and one-fifth of the UNFCCC's. The 2021 bill maintained funding at the same level as last year, but this amount is less than the $10 million previously provided under Obama. Hard work by many members of Congress ensured overall U.S. climate finance did not significantly decline during the Trump administration. But as other countries have continued to scale up their funding the U.S. has still fallen down the rankings. The Biden administration must make up for lost time by rapidly scaling up climate funding and restoring the country to a leading role. Next Steps on Climate Finance for the Biden Administration U.S. reengagement on climate finance is not only a matter of how much, but also where funding is allocated. The complex landscape of climate finance has many possible channels, but some have more impact than others. Here are five top priorities for the Biden administration on international climate finance: 1. Fulfill and Double the US Pledge to the Green Climate Fund Trump stopped U.S. contributions to the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which has a mandate to help countries build low-carbon, resilient economies and take ambitious action under the Paris Agreement. Biden has said he would ""recommit the United States to the Green Climate Fund,"" and it should be number one on his list of international climate finance priorities. The Fund gives developing countries an equal voice in decision-making, and it has some of the strongest policies of any financial institution promoting gender responsiveness and Indigenous peoples' rights. It delivers funding through a diverse range of more than 100 organizations, from major U.S. investors to local businesses and nonprofits in developing countries. While the GCF has faced problems with slow decision making in the past, a new voting procedure instituted in 2019 has led to far more efficient delivery. Last year the Fund approved a record $2 billion for 37 projects, more than any other international climate fund. Obama pledged $3 billion to the GCF in 2014 but only delivered $1 billion before leaving office, meaning the United States still owes $2 billion from that original pledge. In 2019, most other developed countries made a new round of pledges, with many doubling their original commitments. Resumed U.S. contributions to the GCF would deliver the most diplomatic bang for the buck. The GCF was a key part of the grand bargain that underpinned the Paris Agreement: that poorer countries would undertake more climate action but needed increased support from richer countries to do so. Developing countries, as well as the U.S. climate movement, have made clear that ambitious backing for the GCF is a key test of Biden's recommitment to global climate leadership. The GCF now has significant support in Congress: for the first time last year, the House of Representatives requested funding for the GCF. With Democrats also gaining control of the Senate, and members of the pivotal Appropriations Committee backing the Fund, the potential for GCF appropriations has never looked better. To get back up to speed, Biden should deliver the outstanding $2 billion from the country's existing pledge and make a new, more ambitious commitment of $6 billion to match peers who have already doubled their pledges. 2. Contribute to Other Multilateral Climate Institutions The United States should become a first-time contributor to the Adaptation Fund, which helps developing countries adapt to climate impacts. Like the GCF, the Adaptation Fund has an official role in implementing the Paris Agreement. Developing countries are strong champions of the Adaptation Fund because of its track record in quickly delivering funding to small-scale projects that make tangible differences to people's lives. The Fund has also pioneered innovative ways to give developing countries more say over how climate finance is spent, including giving developing countries a majority in its Board, and granting funding directly to recipient country institutions. A U.S. contribution to the Adaptation Fund would signal to the world that the Biden administration will fully and actively support the Paris Agreement, and that it understands the priorities of vulnerable countries. The Adaptation Fund is much smaller than the GCF, receiving just over $1 billion in cumulative contributions over 12 years. Germany is the largest contributor, pledging around $60 million each year. A U.S. contribution on that scale would provide a massive boost to the Adaptation Fund's important work. Similarly, the United States should make a new pledge to the Least Developed Countries Fund — which provides adaptation funding to the poorest countries — at a similar level to the $51 million it pledged in 2015. In 2021, countries will begin negotiating the Global Environment Facility's eighth replenishment, for 2022-2026. The United States should come prepared with an ambitious pledge that makes up for not increasing contributions at the last replenishment in 2018. Biden should also continue support for the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund, and restore full funding for the IPCC and UNFCCC. 3. Integrate Climate Throughout All Development Funding Biden promised to ""fully integrate climate change into foreign policy."" To ensure a coherent approach, his administration must coordinate across the government agencies that extend development assistance to other countries, including the Departments of State and Treasury, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation. The administration should work with Congress to increase bilateral funding allocated in the annual appropriations bills for climate adaptation, renewable energy and sustainable landscapes. In addition to these specific allocations, the administration should also mainstream climate across all its development spending. This does not mean cutting spending from other priorities such as healthcare, education and gender equality, but that as part of an overall increase in the development assistance budget, all spending would take into account the impacts of projects on the climate — and of climate change on projects. This includes ending overseas financing for fossil fuels as part of the administration's commitment to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. Previous efforts by the Obama administration to mainstream climate were reversed by Trump, so the Biden administration should work closely with Congress to ensure these reforms have longevity. 4. Push Development Banks to Align with the Paris Agreement The multilateral development banks are major climate finance contributors. But they also have a long history of financing fossil fuels. In 2018, these banks committed to align their activities with the Paris Agreement, but they have made slow progress. The heads of both the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank are Trump appointees, so this is perhaps unsurprising. The United States is a major shareholder in most multilateral development banks. The banks' leadership are likely to ask for increased funding from the Biden administration, which gives the United States significant influence. For example, last year House Financial Services Committee chair Rep. Maxine Waters secured important reforms to increase accountability and transparency of the World Bank's private sector arm as part of a U.S. capital increase. The Biden administration and Congress are in a strong position to push multilateral development banks to move faster toward Paris alignment, including ending funding for fossil fuels, and ensuring their pandemic recovery funding helps countries rebuild cleaner, more resilient societies. The administration should use all the tools at its disposal, including updating the Treasury guidelines for how U.S. representatives vote in development banks. President Biden's January 27th Executive Order provides a mandate to deliver on all four of these priorities. The administration's forthcoming climate finance plan should set out concrete steps for how the United States will meet its responsibilities and become a leader in supporting developing countries to take ambitious action, which benefits both the United States and the world.

The city was named for George Washington, the first president of the United States and a Founding Father,[9] and the federal district is named after Columbia, a female personification of the nation. As the seat of the U.S. federal government and several international organizations, the city is an important world political capital.[10] It is one of the most visited cities in the U.S., seeing over 20 million visitors in 2016.[11][12] The U.S. Constitution provides for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress; the district is therefore not a part of any U.S. state (nor is it one itself). The signing of the Residence Act on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River near the country's East Coast. The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the national capital, and Congress held its first session there in 1800. In 1801, the territory, formerly part of Maryland and Virginia (including the settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria), officially became recognized as the federal district. In 1846, Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia, including the city of Alexandria; in 1871, it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the district. There have been efforts to make the city into a state since the 1880s, a movement that has gained momentum in recent years, and a statehood bill passed the House of Representatives in 2021.[13] The city is divided into quadrants centered on the Capitol Building, and there are as many as 131 neighborhoods. According to the 2020 Census,[14] it has a population of 689,545, which makes it the 20th-most populous city in the U.S. and gives it a population larger than that of two U.S. states: Wyoming and Vermont.[15] Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek.[16] Washington's metropolitan area, the country's sixth-largest (including parts of Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia), had a 2019 estimated population of 6.3 million residents.[17] The three branches of the U.S. federal government are centered in the district: Congress (legislative), the president (executive), and the Supreme Court (judicial). Washington is home to many national monuments and museums, primarily situated on or around the National Mall. The city hosts 177 foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of many international organizations, trade unions, non-profits, lobbying groups, and professional associations, including the World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, the AARP, the National Geographic Society, the Human Rights Campaign, the International Finance Corporation, and the American Red Cross. A locally elected mayor and a 13-member council have governed the district since 1973. Congress maintains supreme authority over the city and may overturn local laws. D.C. residents elect a non-voting, at-large congressional delegate to the House of Representatives, but the district has no representation in the Senate. District voters choose three presidential electors in accordance with the Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1961.

Further information: History of Washington, D.C.; Timeline of Washington, D.C.; and District of Columbia (until 1871) Various tribes of the Algonquian-speaking Piscataway people (also known as the Conoy) inhabited the lands around the Potomac River when Europeans first visited the area in the early 17th century. One group known as the Nacotchtank (also called the Nacostines by Catholic missionaries) maintained settlements around the Anacostia River within the present-day District of Columbia. Conflicts with European colonists and neighboring tribes forced the relocation of the Piscataway people, some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near Point of Rocks, Maryland.[18] In his Federalist No. 43, published January 23, 1788, James Madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety.[19] Five years earlier, a band of unpaid soldiers had besieged Congress while its members were meeting in Philadelphia. Known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, the event emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own security.[20] Article One, Section Eight, of the Constitution permits the establishment of a ""District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States"".[21] However, the Constitution does not specify a location for the capital. In what is now known as the Compromise of 1790, Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson agreed that the federal government would pay each state's remaining Revolutionary War debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the Southern United States.[22][a] Foundation On July 9, 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act, which approved the creation of a national capital on the Potomac River. The exact location was to be selected by President George Washington, who signed the bill into law on July 16. Formed from land donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles (16 km) on each side, totaling 100 square miles (259 km2).[23][b] Two pre-existing settlements were included in the territory: the port of Georgetown, Maryland, founded in 1751,[24] and the city of Alexandria, Virginia, founded in 1749.[25] During 1791–92, a team under Andrew Ellicott, including Ellicott's brothers Joseph and Benjamin and African-American astronomer Benjamin Banneker, surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point.[26] Many of the stones are still standing.[27] A new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the Potomac, to the east of Georgetown. On September 9, 1791, the three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. The same day, the federal district was named Columbia (a feminine form of ""Columbus""), which was a poetic name for the United States commonly in use at that time.[28][29] Congress held its first session there on November 17, 1800.[30][31] Congress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government. Further, the unincorporated area within the district was organized into two counties: the County of Washington to the east of the Potomac and the County of Alexandria to the west.[32] After the passage of this Act, citizens living in the district were no longer considered residents of Maryland or Virginia, which therefore ended their representation in Congress.[33] Burning during the War of 1812 Main article: War of 1812 Following their victory at the Battle of Bladensburg, the British entered Washington, D.C., burning down buildings, including the White House. On August 24–25, 1814, in a raid known as the Burning of Washington, British forces invaded the capital during the War of 1812. The Capitol, Treasury, and White House were burned and gutted during the attack.[34] Most government buildings were repaired quickly; however, the Capitol was largely under construction at the time and was not completed in its current form until 1868.[35] Retrocession and the Civil War See also: District of Columbia retrocession and Washington, D.C., in the American Civil War President Abraham Lincoln insisted that construction of the United States Capitol dome continue during the American Civil War (1861). In the 1830s, the district's southern territory of Alexandria went into economic decline partly due to neglect by Congress.[36] The city of Alexandria was a major market in the American slave trade, and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in Congress would end slavery in the district, further depressing the economy. Alexandria's citizens petitioned Virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the district, through a process known as retrocession.[37] The Virginia General Assembly voted in February 1846 to accept the return of Alexandria. On July 9, 1846, Congress agreed to return all the territory that Virginia had ceded. Therefore, the district's area consists only of the portion originally donated by Maryland.[36] Confirming the fears of pro-slavery Alexandrians, the Compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the district, although not slavery itself.[38] The outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 led to the expansion of the federal government and notable growth in the district's population, including a large influx of freed slaves.[39] President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act in 1862, which ended slavery in the district of Columbia and freed about 3,100 enslaved persons, nine months prior to the Emancipation Proclamation.[40] In 1868, Congress granted the district's African American male residents the right to vote in municipal elections.[39] Growth and redevelopment By 1870, the district's population had grown 75% from the previous census to nearly 132,000 residents.[41] Despite the city's growth, Washington still had dirt roads and lacked basic sanitation. Some members of Congress suggested moving the capital further west, but President Ulysses S. Grant refused to consider such a proposal.[42] Congress passed the Organic Act of 1871, which repealed the individual charters of the cities of Washington and Georgetown, and created a new territorial government for the whole District of Columbia.[43] President Grant appointed Alexander Robey Shepherd to the position of governor in 1873. Shepherd authorized large-scale projects that greatly modernized the City of Washington, but ultimately bankrupted the district government. In 1874, Congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three-member Board of Commissioners.[44] The city's first motorized streetcars began service in 1888. They generated growth in areas of the district beyond the City of Washington's original boundaries. Washington's urban plan was expanded throughout the district in the following decades.[45] Georgetown's street grid and other administrative details were formally merged to those of the legal City of Washington in 1895.[46] However, the city had poor housing conditions and strained public works. The district was the first city in the nation to undergo urban renewal projects as part of the ""City Beautiful movement"" in the early 1900s.[47] Increased federal spending as a result of the New Deal in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings, memorials, and museums in the district,[48] though the chairman of the House Subcommittee on District Appropriations Ross A. Collins from Mississippi justified cuts to funds for welfare and education for local residents, saying that ""my constituents wouldn't stand for spending money on niggers.""[49] World War II further increased government activity, adding to the number of federal employees in the capital;[50] by 1950, the district's population reached its peak of 802,178 residents.[41] Civil rights and home rule era Crowds surrounding the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool during the March on Washington, 1963 External video 1960s Washington DC, 4K from 35mm Kinolibrary The Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1961, granting the district three votes in the Electoral College for the election of president and vice president, but still no voting representation in Congress.[51] After the assassination of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., on April 4, 1968, riots broke out in the district, primarily in the U Street, 14th Street, 7th Street, and H Street corridors, centers of black residential and commercial areas. The riots raged for three days until more than 13,600 federal troops and D.C. Army National Guardsmen stopped the violence. Many stores and other buildings were burned; rebuilding was not completed until the late 1990s.[52] In 1973, Congress enacted the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, providing for an elected mayor and thirteen-member council for the district.[53] In 1975, Walter Washington became the first elected and first black mayor of the district.[54] Geography Main article: Geography of Washington, D.C.

Due to the District of Columbia retrocession, the city has a total area of 68.34 square miles (177 km2), of which 61.05 square miles (158.1 km2) is land and 7.29 square miles (18.9 km2) (10.67%) is water.[55] The district is bordered by Montgomery County, Maryland to the northwest; Prince George's County, Maryland to the east; Arlington County, Virginia to the west; and Alexandria, Virginia to the south. Washington, D.C., is 38 miles (61 km) from Baltimore, 124 miles (200 km) from Philadelphia and 227 miles (365 km) from New York City. The south bank of the Potomac River forms the district's border with Virginia and has two major tributaries: the Anacostia River and Rock Creek.[56] Tiber Creek, a natural watercourse that once passed through the National Mall, was fully enclosed underground during the 1870s.[57] The creek also formed a portion of the now-filled Washington City Canal, which allowed passage through the city to the Anacostia River from 1815 until the 1850s.[58] The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal starts in Georgetown and was used during the 19th century to bypass the Little Falls of the Potomac River, located at the northwest edge of Washington at the Atlantic Seaboard fall line.[59] The highest natural elevation in the district is 409 feet (125 m) above sea level at Fort Reno Park in upper northwest Washington.[60] The lowest point is sea level at the Potomac River.[61] The geographic center of Washington is near the intersection of 4th and L Streets NW.[62][63][64] The district has 7,464 acres (30.21 km2) of parkland, about 19% of the city's total area and the second-highest percentage among high-density U.S. cities.[65] This factor contributed to Washington, D.C., being ranked as third in the nation for park access and quality in the 2018 ParkScore ranking of the park systems of the 100 most populous cities in the United States, according to the nonprofit Trust for Public Land.[66] The National Park Service manages most of the 9,122 acres (36.92 km2) of city land owned by the U.S. government.[67] Rock Creek Park is a 1,754-acre (7.10 km2) urban forest in Northwest Washington, which extends 9.3 miles (15.0 km) through a stream valley that bisects the city. Established in 1890, it is the country's fourth-oldest national park and is home to a variety of plant and animal species, including raccoon, deer, owls, and coyotes.[68] Other National Park Service properties include the C&O Canal National Historical Park, the National Mall and Memorial Parks, Theodore Roosevelt Island, Columbia Island, Fort Dupont Park, Meridian Hill Park, Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens, and Anacostia Park.[69] The D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation maintains the city's 900 acres (3.6 km2) of athletic fields and playgrounds, 40 swimming pools, and 68 recreation centers.[70] The U.S. Department of Agriculture operates the 446-acre (1.80 km2) U.S. National Arboretum in Northeast Washington.[71] Climate Washington is in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen: Cfa).[72] The Trewartha classification is defined as an oceanic climate (Do).[73] Winters are usually cool with light snow, and summers are hot and humid. The district is in plant hardiness zone 8a near downtown, and zone 7b elsewhere in the city, indicating a humid subtropical climate.[74] Spring and fall are mild to warm, while winter is cool with annual snowfall averaging 15.5 inches (39 cm). Winter temperatures average around 38 °F (3 °C) from mid-December to mid-February.[75] However, winter temperatures in excess of 60 °F (16 °C) are not uncommon.[76] Summers are hot and humid with a July daily average of 79.8 °F (26.6 °C) and average daily relative humidity around 66%, which can cause moderate personal discomfort. Heat indices regularly approach 100 °F (38 °C) at the height of summer.[77] The combination of heat and humidity in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms, some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area.[78] Blizzards affect Washington, on average, once every four to six years. The most violent storms are called ""nor'easters"", which often affect large sections of the East Coast.[79] From January 27 to 28, 1922, the city officially received 28 inches (71 cm) of snowfall, the largest snowstorm since official measurements began in 1885.[80] According to notes kept at the time, the city received between 30 and 36 inches (76 and 91 cm) from a snowstorm in January 1772.[81] The Washington Monument, seen across the Tidal Basin during 2007's National Cherry Blossom Festival Hurricanes (or their remnants) occasionally track through the area in late summer and early fall. However, they are often weak by the time they reach Washington, partly due to the city's inland location.[82] Flooding of the Potomac River, however, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, has been known to cause extensive property damage in the neighborhood of Georgetown.[83] Precipitation occurs throughout the year.[84] Washington's climate will grow warmer and rainfall will increase as the result of climate change.[85] The highest recorded temperature was 106 °F (41 °C) on August 6, 1918, and on July 20, 1930.[86] while the lowest recorded temperature was −15 °F (−26 °C) on February 11, 1899, right before the Great Blizzard of 1899.[79] During a typical year, the city averages about 37 days at or above 90 °F (32 °C) and 64 nights at or below the freezing mark (32 °F or 0 °C).[75] On average, the first day with a minimum at or below freezing is November 18 and the last day is March 27.[87][88] vteClimate data for Washington, D.C.

The L'Enfant Plan for Washington, D.C., as revised by Andrew Ellicott in 1792 Washington, D.C., is a planned city. In 1791, President Washington commissioned Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant, a French-born architect and city planner, to design the new capital. He enlisted Scottish surveyor Alexander Ralston to help lay out the city plan.[93] The L'Enfant Plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles, providing room for open space and landscaping.[94] He based his design on plans of cities such as Paris, Amsterdam, Karlsruhe, and Milan that Thomas Jefferson had sent to him.[95] L'Enfant's design also envisioned a garden-lined ""grand avenue"" approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) in length and 400 feet (120 m) wide in the area that is now the National Mall.[96] President Washington dismissed L'Enfant in March 1792 due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capital's construction. Andrew Ellicott, who had worked with L'Enfant surveying the city, was then tasked with completing the design. Though Ellicott made revisions to the original plans—including changes to some street patterns—L'Enfant is still credited with the overall design of the city.[97] Construction of the 12-story Cairo Apartment Building (1894) spurred building height restrictions. By the early 20th century, L'Enfant's vision of a grand national capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings, including a railroad station on the National Mall. Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core.[47] What became known as the McMillan Plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the Capitol grounds and the National Mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system. The plan is thought to have largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design.[94] By law, Washington's skyline is low and sprawling. The federal Height of Buildings Act of 1910 allows buildings that are no taller than the width of the adjacent street, plus 20 feet (6.1 m).[98] Despite popular belief, no law has ever limited buildings to the height of the United States Capitol Building or the 555-foot (169 m) Washington Monument,[64] which remains the district's tallest structure. City leaders have criticized the height restriction as a primary reason why the district has limited affordable housing and traffic problems caused by suburban sprawl.[98] The district is divided into four quadrants of unequal area: Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), Southeast (SE), and Southwest (SW). The axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the U.S. Capitol building.[99] All road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location and house numbers generally correspond with the number of blocks away from the Capitol. Most streets are set out in a grid pattern with east–west streets named with letters (e.g., C Street SW), north–south streets with numbers (e.g., 4th Street NW), and diagonal avenues, many of which are named after states.[99] The Georgetown neighborhood is known for its historic Federal-style rowhouses. The City of Washington was bordered by Boundary Street to the north (renamed Florida Avenue in 1890), Rock Creek to the west, and the Anacostia River to the east.[45][94] Washington's street grid was extended, where possible, throughout the district starting in 1888.[100] Georgetown's streets were renamed in 1895.[46] Some streets are particularly noteworthy, such as Pennsylvania Avenue—which connects the White House to the Capitol, and K Street—which houses the offices of many lobbying groups.[101] Constitution Avenue and Independence Avenue, located on the north and south sides of the National Mall, respectively, are home to many of Washington's iconic museums, including the Smithsonian Institution buildings, the National Archives Building. Washington hosts 177 foreign embassies, constituting approximately 297 buildings beyond the more than 1,600 residential properties owned by foreign countries, many of which are on a section of Massachusetts Avenue informally known as Embassy Row.[102] Architecture Meridian Hill Park, in Columbia Heights The architecture of Washington varies greatly. Six of the top 10 buildings in the American Institute of Architects' 2007 ranking of ""America's Favorite Architecture"" are in the District of Columbia:[103] the White House, the Washington National Cathedral, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial, the United States Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The neoclassical, Georgian, gothic, and modern architectural styles are all reflected among those six structures and many other prominent edifices in Washington. Notable exceptions include buildings constructed in the French Second Empire style such as the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.[104] Outside downtown Washington, architectural styles are even more varied. Historic buildings are designed primarily in the Queen Anne, Châteauesque, Richardsonian Romanesque, Georgian revival, Beaux-Arts, and a variety of Victorian styles. Rowhouses are especially prominent in areas developed after the Civil War and typically follow Federalist and late Victorian designs.[105] Georgetown's Old Stone House was built in 1765, making it the oldest-standing original building in the city.[106] Founded in 1789, Georgetown University features a mix of Romanesque and Gothic Revival architecture.[104] The Ronald Reagan Building is the largest building in the district with a total area of approximately 3.1 million square feet (288,000 m2).[107] Demographics Main article: Demographics of Washington, D.C.

When measured on a decade-over-decade basis, this continues a growth trend since 2000, following a half-century of population decline.[114] But on a year-over-year basis, the July 2019 census count shows a population decline of 16,000 individuals over the preceding 12-month period.[115] Washington was the 24th most populous place in the United States as of 2010[update].[116] According to data from 2010, commuters from the suburbs increase the district's daytime population to over a million.[117] If the district were a state it would rank 49th in population, ahead of Vermont and Wyoming.[118] The Washington Metropolitan Area, which includes the district and surrounding suburbs, is the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the United States with an estimated six million residents in 2014.[119] When the Washington area is included with Baltimore and its suburbs, the Baltimore–Washington Metropolitan Area had a population exceeding 9.8 million residents in 2020, the third-largest combined statistical area in the country.[120] According to 2017 Census Bureau data, the population of Washington, D.C., was 47.1% Black or African American, 45.1% White (36.8% non-Hispanic White), 4.3% Asian, 0.6% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Individuals from two or more races made up 2.7% of the population. Hispanics of any race made up 11.0% of the district's population.[118] Map of racial distribution in Washington, D.C., according to the 2010 U.S. Census. Each dot is 25 people: White, Black, Asian, Hispanic or Other (yellow) Washington has had a significant African American population since the city's foundation.[121] African American residents composed about 30% of the district's total population between 1800 and 1940.[41] The black population reached a peak of 70% by 1970, but has since steadily declined due to many African Americans moving to the surrounding suburbs. Partly as a result of gentrification, there was a 31.4% increase in the non-Hispanic white population and an 11.5% decrease in the black population between 2000 and 2010.[122] According to a study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, D.C. has experienced more ""intense"" gentrification than any other American city, with 40% of neighborhoods gentrified.[123] About 17% of D.C. residents were age 18 or younger in 2010, lower than the U.S. average of 24%. However, at 34 years old, the district had the lowest median age compared to the 50 states.[124] As of 2010[update], there were an estimated 81,734 immigrants living in Washington, D.C.[125] Major sources of immigration include El Salvador, Vietnam, and Ethiopia, with a concentration of Salvadorans in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood.[126] Researchers found that there were 4,822 same-sex couples in the District of Columbia in 2010, about 2% of total households.[127] Legislation authorizing same-sex marriage passed in 2009, and the district began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in March 2010.[128] A 2007 report found that about a third of district residents were functionally illiterate, compared to a national rate of about one in five. This is attributed in part to immigrants who are not proficient in English.[129] As of 2011[update], 85% of D.C. residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language.[130] Half of residents had at least a four-year college degree in 2006.[125] In 2017, the median household income in D.C. was $77,649;[131] also in 2017, D.C. residents had a personal income per capita of $50,832 (higher than any of the 50 states).[131][132] However, 19% of residents were below the poverty level in 2005, higher than any state except Mississippi. In 2019, the poverty rate stood at 14.7%.[133][g][135] Of the district's population, 17% is Baptist, 13% is Catholic, 6% is evangelical Protestant, 4% is Methodist, 3% is Episcopalian/Anglican, 3% is Jewish, 2% is Eastern Orthodox, 1% is Pentecostal, 1% is Buddhist, 1% is Adventist, 1% is Lutheran, 1% is Muslim, 1% is Presbyterian, 1% is Mormon, and 1% is Hindu.[136][h] As of 2010[update], more than 90% of D.C. residents had health insurance coverage, the second-highest rate in the nation. This is due in part to city programs that help provide insurance to low-income individuals who do not qualify for other types of coverage.[137] A 2009 report found that at least three percent of district residents have HIV or AIDS, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) characterizes as a ""generalized and severe"" epidemic.[138] Crime Main article: Crime in Washington, D.C. See also: List of law enforcement agencies in the District of Columbia D.C. police on Harley-Davidson motorcycles escort a protest in 2018. Crime in Washington, D.C., is concentrated in areas associated with poverty, drug abuse, and gangs. A 2010 study found that 5 percent of city blocks accounted for more than 25% of the district's total crimes.[139] The more affluent neighborhoods of Northwest Washington are typically safe, especially in areas with concentrations of government operations, such as Downtown Washington, D.C., Foggy Bottom, Embassy Row, and Penn Quarter, but reports of violent crime increase in poorer neighborhoods generally concentrated in the eastern portion of the city.[139] Approximately 60,000 residents are ex-convicts.[140] In 2012, Washington's annual murder count had dropped to 88, the lowest total since 1961.[141] The murder rate has since risen from that historic low, though it remains close to half the rate of the early 2000s.[142] Washington was once described as the ""murder capital"" of the United States during the early 1990s.[143] The number of murders peaked in 1991 at 479, but the level of violence then began to decline significantly.[144] In 2016, the district's Metropolitan Police Department tallied 135 homicides, a 53% increase from 2012 but a 17% decrease from 2015.[145] Many neighborhoods such as Columbia Heights and Logan Circle are becoming safer and vibrant. However, incidents of robberies and thefts have remained higher in these areas because of increased nightlife activity and greater numbers of affluent residents.[146] Even still, citywide reports of both property and violent crimes have declined by nearly half since their most recent highs in the mid-1990s.[147] On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held in District of Columbia v. Heller that the city's 1976 handgun ban violated the right to keep and bear arms as protected under the Second Amendment.[148] However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban.[149] In addition to the district's own Metropolitan Police Department, many federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city as well—most visibly the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.[150] Economy See also the categories Companies based in Washington, D.C. and Non-profit organizations based in Washington, D.C. Federal Triangle, between Constitution Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue. The U.S. federal government accounts for about 29% of D.C. jobs. Washington has a growing, diversified economy with an increasing percentage of professional and business service jobs.[151] The district's gross state product in 2018-Q2 was $141 billion.[152] The Washington Metropolitan Area's gross product was $435 billion in 2014, making it the sixth-largest metropolitan economy in the United States.[153] Between 2009 and 2016, GDP per capita in Washington has consistently ranked on the very top among U.S. states.[154] In 2016, at $160,472, its GDP per capita is almost three times as high as that of Massachusetts, which was ranked second in the nation.[154] As of 2011[update], the Washington Metropolitan Area had an unemployment rate of 6.2%; the second-lowest rate among the 49 largest metro areas in the nation.[155] The District of Columbia itself had an unemployment rate of 9.8% during the same time period.[156] In December 2017, 25% of the employees in Washington, D.C., were employed by a federal governmental agency.[157][158] This is thought to immunize Washington, D.C., to national economic downturns because the federal government continues operations even during recessions.[159] Many organizations such as law firms, defense contractors, civilian contractors, nonprofit organizations, lobbying firms, trade unions, industry trade groups, and professional associations have their headquarters in or near Washington, D.C., in order to be close to the federal government.[101] The city of Rosslyn, Virginia, located across the Potomac River from D.C., serves as a base of operations for several Fortune 500 companies, due to the building height restrictions in place within the District of Columbia. In 2018, Amazon announced they would build ""HQ 2"" in the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia.[160] Tourism is Washington's second-largest industry. Approximately 18.9 million visitors contributed an estimated $4.8 billion to the local economy in 2012.[161] The district also hosts nearly 200 foreign embassies and international organizations such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organization of American States, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Pan American Health Organization. In 2008, the foreign diplomatic corps in Washington employed about 10,000 people and contributed an estimated $400 million annually to the local economy.[102] The district has growing industries not directly related to government, especially in the areas of education, finance, public policy, and scientific research. Georgetown University, George Washington University, Washington Hospital Center, Children's National Medical Center and Howard University are the top five non-government-related employers in the city as of 2009[update].[162] According to statistics compiled in 2011, four of the largest 500 companies in the country were headquartered in the district.[163] In the 2021 Global Financial Centres Index, Washington was ranked as having the 14th most competitive financial center in the world, and fourth most competitive in the United States (after New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles).[164] Culture Main article: Culture of Washington, D.C. Landmarks See also: List of National Historic Landmarks in Washington, D.C. and National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington, D.C. The Lincoln Memorial receives about six million visits annually. The National Mall is a large, open park in downtown Washington between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol. Given its prominence, the mall is often the location of political protests, concerts, festivals, and presidential inaugurations. The Washington Monument and the Jefferson Pier are near the center of the mall, south of the White House. Also on the mall are the National World War II Memorial at the east end of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.[165] Directly south of the mall, the Tidal Basin features rows of Japanese cherry trees.[166] The Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, George Mason Memorial, Jefferson Memorial, Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, and the District of Columbia War Memorial are around the Tidal Basin.[165] The National Archives houses thousands of documents important to American history, including the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.[167] Located in three buildings on Capitol Hill, the Library of Congress is the largest library complex in the world with a collection of more than 147 million books, manuscripts, and other materials.[168] The United States Supreme Court Building was completed in 1935; before then, the court held sessions in the Old Senate Chamber of the Capitol.[169] Museums See also: List of museums in Washington, D.C. The Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest research and museum complex.[170] The Smithsonian Institution is an educational foundation chartered by Congress in 1846 that maintains most of the nation's official museums and galleries in Washington, D.C. The U.S. government partially funds the Smithsonian, and its collections are open to the public free of charge.[171] The Smithsonian's locations had a combined total of 30 million visits in 2013. The most visited museum is the National Museum of Natural History on the National Mall.[172] Other Smithsonian Institution museums and galleries on the mall are: the National Air and Space Museum; the National Museum of African Art; the National Museum of American History; the National Museum of the American Indian; the Sackler and Freer galleries, which both focus on Asian art and culture; the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden; the Arts and Industries Building; the S. Dillon Ripley Center; and the Smithsonian Institution Building (also known as ""The Castle""), which serves as the institution's headquarters.[173] The Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallery are housed in the Old Patent Office Building, near Washington's Chinatown.[174] The Renwick Gallery is officially part of the Smithsonian American Art Museum but is in a separate building near the White House. Other Smithsonian museums and galleries include: the Anacostia Community Museum in Southeast Washington; the National Postal Museum near Union Station; and the National Zoo in Woodley Park.[173] The National Gallery of Art The National Gallery of Art is on the National Mall near the Capitol and features American and European artworks. The U.S. government owns the gallery and its collections. However, they are not a part of the Smithsonian Institution.[175] The National Building Museum, which occupies the former Pension Building near Judiciary Square, was chartered by Congress and hosts exhibits on architecture, urban planning, and design.[176] There are many private art museums in the District of Columbia, which house major collections and exhibits open to the public, such as the National Museum of Women in the Arts and The Phillips Collection in Dupont Circle, the first museum of modern art in the United States.[177] Other private museums in Washington include the Newseum, the O Street Museum, the International Spy Museum, the National Geographic Society Museum, and the Museum of the Bible. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum near the National Mall maintains exhibits, documentation, and artifacts related to the Holocaust.[178] Arts Main articles: Theater in Washington, D.C. and Music of Washington, D.C. The Kennedy Center for Performing Arts is home to the Washington National Opera and National Symphony Orchestra. Washington, D.C., is a national center for the arts. The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is home to the National Symphony Orchestra, the Washington National Opera, and the Washington Ballet. The Kennedy Center Honors are awarded each year to those in the performing arts who have contributed greatly to the cultural life of the United States.[179] The historic Ford's Theatre, site of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, continues to operate as a functioning performance space as well as a museum.[180] The Marine Barracks near Capitol Hill houses the United States Marine Band; founded in 1798, it is the country's oldest professional musical organization.[181] American march composer and Washington-native John Philip Sousa led the Marine Band from 1880 until 1892.[182] Founded in 1925, the United States Navy Band has its headquarters at the Washington Navy Yard and performs at official events and public concerts around the city.[183] Washington has a strong local theater tradition. Founded in 1950, Arena Stage achieved national attention and spurred growth in the city's independent theater movement that now includes organizations such as the Shakespeare Theatre Company, Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company, and the Studio Theatre.[184] Arena Stage opened its newly renovated home in the city's emerging Southwest waterfront area in 2010.[185] The GALA Hispanic Theatre, now housed in the historic Tivoli Theatre in Columbia Heights, was founded in 1976 and is a National Center for the Latino Performing Arts.[186] The U Street Corridor in Northwest D.C., known as ""Washington's Black Broadway"", is home to institutions like the Howard Theatre, Bohemian Caverns, and the Lincoln Theatre, which hosted music legends such as Washington-native Duke Ellington, John Coltrane, and Miles Davis.[187] Washington has its own native music genre called go-go; a post-funk, percussion-driven flavor of rhythm and blues that was popularized in the late 1970s by D.C. band leader Chuck Brown.[188] The district is an important center for indie culture and music in the United States. The label Dischord Records, formed by Ian MacKaye, frontman of Fugazi, was one of the most crucial independent labels in the genesis of 1980s punk and eventually indie rock in the 1990s.[189] Modern alternative and indie music venues like The Black Cat and the 9:30 Club bring popular acts to the U Street area.[190] Sports Main article: Sports in Washington, D.C. Nationals Park is the home of the Washington Nationals. Washington is one of 13 cities in the United States with teams from all four major professional men's sports and is home to one major professional women's team. The Washington Wizards (National Basketball Association) and the Washington Capitals (National Hockey League) play at the Capital One Arena in Chinatown. The Washington Mystics (Women's National Basketball Association) play in the St. Elizabeths East Entertainment and Sports Arena.

Washington is also home to two major annual marathon races: the Marine Corps Marathon, which is held every autumn, and the Rock 'n' Roll USA Marathon held in the spring. The Marine Corps Marathon began in 1976 and is sometimes called ""The People's Marathon"" because it is the largest marathon that does not offer prize money to participants.[195] The district's four NCAA Division I teams, American Eagles, George Washington Colonials, Georgetown Hoyas and Howard Bison and Lady Bison, have a broad following. The Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team is the most notable and also plays at the Capital One Arena. From 2008 to 2012, the district hosted an annual college football bowl game at RFK Stadium, called the Military Bowl.[196] The D.C. area is home to one regional sports television network, Comcast SportsNet (CSN), based in Bethesda, Maryland. Media Main article: Media in Washington, D.C. See also: List of newspapers in Washington, D.C.; List of films set in Washington, D.C.; and List of television shows set in Washington, D.C. One Franklin Square: The Washington Post Building on Franklin Square Washington, D.C., is a prominent center for national and international media. The Washington Post, founded in 1877, is the oldest and most-read local daily newspaper in Washington.[197] ""The Post"", as it is popularly called, is well known as the newspaper that exposed the Watergate scandal.[198] It had the sixth-highest readership of all news dailies in the country in 2011.[199] From 2003 to 2019, The Washington Post Company published a daily free commuter newspaper called the Express, which summarized events, sports and entertainment;[200] it still publishes the Spanish-language paper El Tiempo Latino. Another popular local daily is The Washington Times, the city's second general interest broadsheet and also an influential paper in conservative political circles.[201] The alternative weekly Washington City Paper also has a substantial readership in the Washington area.[202][203] The Watergate complex was the site of the Watergate Scandal, which led to President Nixon's resignation. Some community and specialty papers focus on neighborhood and cultural issues, including the weekly Washington Blade and Metro Weekly, which focus on LGBT issues; the Washington Informer and The Washington Afro American, which highlight topics of interest to the black community; and neighborhood newspapers published by The Current Newspapers. Congressional Quarterly, The Hill, Politico and Roll Call newspapers focus exclusively on issues related to Congress and the federal government. Other publications based in Washington include the National Geographic magazine and political publications such as The Washington Examiner, The New Republic and Washington Monthly.[204] The Washington Metropolitan Area is the ninth-largest television media market in the nation, with two million homes, approximately 2% of the country's population.[205] Several media companies and cable television channels have their headquarters in the area, including C-SPAN; Black Entertainment Television (BET); Radio One; the National Geographic Channel; Smithsonian Networks; National Public Radio (NPR); Travel Channel (in Chevy Chase, Maryland); Discovery Communications (in Silver Spring, Maryland); and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) (in Arlington, Virginia). The headquarters of Voice of America, the U.S. government's international news service, is near the Capitol in Southwest Washington.[206] Washington has two local NPR affiliates, WAMU and WETA. Government and politics Main article: Government of the District of Columbia Politics See also: District of Columbia home rule; List of mayors of Washington, D.C.; List of District of Columbia symbols; and United States presidential elections in Washington, D.C. Article One, Section Eight of the United States Constitution grants the United States Congress ""exclusive jurisdiction"" over the city. The district did not have an elected local government until the passage of the 1973 Home Rule Act. The Act devolved certain Congressional powers to an elected mayor and the thirteen-member Council of the District of Columbia. However, Congress retains the right to review and overturn laws created by the council and intervene in local affairs.[207] Each of the city's eight wards elects a single member of the council and residents elect four at-large members to represent the district as a whole. The council chair is also elected at-large.[208] There are 37 Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs) elected by small neighborhood districts. ANCs can issue recommendations on all issues that affect residents; government agencies take their advice under careful consideration.[209] The attorney general of the District of Columbia is elected to a four-year term.[210] Washington, D.C., observes all federal holidays and also celebrates Emancipation Day on April 16, which commemorates the end of slavery in the district.[40] The flag of Washington, D.C., was adopted in 1938 and is a variation on George Washington's family coat of arms.[211] Washington, D.C., is overwhelmingly Democratic, having voted for the Democratic candidate solidly since it was granted electoral votes in 1964. Each Republican candidate was voted down in favor of the Democratic candidate by a margin of at least 56 percentage points each time; the closest, albeit very large, margin between the two parties in a presidential election was in 1972, when Richard Nixon secured 21.56% of the vote to George McGovern's 78.10%. Since then, the Republican candidate has never received more than 20 percent of the vote. Every Democrat since 2008 has received over 90% of the vote. Additionally, since 2016, the city's residential voting population has become almost unanimously Democratic, more so than it has ever been. Since 2016, no Democrat has received less than 93% of the major-party vote in the federal district, a level of support that has not been crossed districtwide before that election. Same-sex marriage has been legal in the district since 2010, and conversion therapy has been prohibited since 2015. Assisted suicide is also permitted in the district, with a bill legalizing the practice being introduced in 2015, signed by mayor Muriel Bowser in 2016, and going into effect in 2017, making Washington, D.C., the seventh jurisdiction in the United States to have legalized assisted suicide, along with Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Montana and Vermont. Washington, D.C., has been a member state of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) since 2015. The idiom Inside the Beltway is an occasional reference used by media to describe political issues inside of Washington, D.C., by way of geographical demarcation regarding the region inner to the Capital's Beltway, Interstate 495, the city's highway loop (beltway) constructed in 1964. Budgetary issues The John A. Wilson Building houses the offices of the mayor of Washington and the Council of the District of Columbia. The mayor and council set local taxes and a budget, which Congress must approve. The Government Accountability Office and other analysts have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the Congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the district's local budget of anywhere between $470 million and over $1 billion per year. Congress typically provides additional grants for federal programs such as Medicaid and the operation of the local justice system; however, analysts claim that the payments do not fully resolve the imbalance.[212][213] The city's local government, particularly during the mayoralty of Marion Barry, was criticized for mismanagement and waste.[214] During his administration in 1989, The Washington Monthly magazine claimed that the district had ""the worst city government in America"".[215] In 1995, at the start of Barry's fourth term, Congress created the District of Columbia Financial Control Board to oversee all municipal spending.[216] Mayor Anthony Williams won election in 1998 and oversaw a period of urban renewal and budget surpluses. The district regained control over its finances in 2001 and the oversight board's operations were suspended.[217] The district has a federally funded ""Emergency Planning and Security Fund"" to cover security related to visits by foreign leaders and diplomats, presidential inaugurations, protests, and terrorism concerns. During the Trump administration, the fund has run with a deficit. Trump's January 2017 inauguration cost the city $27 million; of that, $7 million was never repaid to the fund. Trump's 2019 Independence Day event, ""A Salute to America"", cost six times more than Independence Day events in past years.[218] Voting rights debate See also: District of Columbia voting rights and Political party strength in Washington, D.C. The Eisenhower Executive Office Building, once the world's largest office building, houses the Executive Office of the President of the United States. The district is not a state and therefore has no voting representation in Congress. D.C. residents elect a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives (D.C. At-Large), who may sit on committees, participate in debate, and introduce legislation, but cannot vote on the House floor. The district has no official representation in the United States Senate. Neither chamber seats the district's elected ""shadow"" representative or senators. Unlike residents of U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico or Guam, which also have non-voting delegates, D.C. residents are subject to all federal taxes.[219] In the financial year 2012, D.C. residents and businesses paid $20.7 billion in federal taxes; more than the taxes collected from 19 states and the highest federal taxes per capita.[220] A 2005 poll found that 78% of Americans did not know residents of the District of Columbia have less representation in Congress than residents of the fifty states.[221] Efforts to raise awareness about the issue have included campaigns by grassroots organizations and featuring the city's unofficial motto, ""Taxation Without Representation"", on D.C. vehicle license plates.[222] There is evidence of nationwide approval for D.C. voting rights; various polls indicate that 61 to 82% of Americans believe D.C. should have voting representation in Congress.[221][223] Several approaches to resolving these concerns been suggested over the years: District of Columbia Statehood: Almost all the District of Columbia would become the 51st State as Washington, Douglass Commonwealth. The much-reduced District of Columbia would run from Capitol Hill west to the Potomac, including the White House and many federal buildings; no one resides permanently in this federal enclave. District of Columbia Retrocession to Maryland: As Arlington County in 1846 was retroceded to Virginia, proponents believe the rest of the District of Columbia except for a small strip of land around the Capitol and the White House (the federal enclave) would be given back to Maryland, allowing for DC residents to become Maryland residents as they were before the Residence Act of 1790. District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment: this option would allow DC residents to vote in Maryland or Virginia for their congressional representatives, with the District of Columbia remaining an independent entity. This was in effect from 1790 to 1801, before the Organic Act of 1801. Opponents of D.C. voting rights propose that the Founding Fathers never intended for district residents to have a vote in Congress since the Constitution makes clear that representation must come from the states. Those opposed to making D.C. a state claim such a move would destroy the notion of a separate national capital and that statehood would unfairly grant Senate representation to a single city.[224] Sister cities Washington, D.C., has fifteen official sister city agreements. Each of the listed cities is a national capital except for Sunderland, which includes the town of Washington, the ancestral home of George Washington's family.[225] Paris and Rome are each formally recognized as a partner city due to their special one sister city policy.[226] Listed in the order each agreement was first established, they are: Bangkok, Thailand (1962, renewed 2002 and 2012) Dakar, Senegal (1980, renewed 2006) Beijing, China (1984, renewed 2004 and 2012) Brussels, Belgium (1985, renewed 2002 and 2011) Athens, Greece (2000) Paris, France (2000 as a friendship and cooperation agreement, renewed 2005)[226][227] Pretoria, South Africa (2002, renewed 2008 and 2011) Seoul, South Korea (2006) Accra, Ghana (2006) Sunderland, United Kingdom (2006, renewed 2012)[225] Rome, Italy (2011, renewed 2013)[226] Ankara, Turkey (2011) Brasília, Brazil (2013) Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2013)[228] San Salvador, El Salvador (2018) Education See also: List of parochial and private schools in Washington, D.C. The Library of Congress is one of the world's largest libraries, with more than 167 million cataloged items.[229] District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) operates the city's 123 public schools.[230] The number of students in DCPS steadily decreased for 39 years until 2009. In the 2010–11 school year, 46,191 students were enrolled in the public school system.[231] DCPS has one of the highest-cost, yet lowest-performing school systems in the country, in terms of both infrastructure and student achievement.[232] Mayor Adrian Fenty's administration made sweeping changes to the system by closing schools, replacing teachers, firing principals, and using private education firms to aid curriculum development.[233] The District of Columbia Public Charter School Board monitors the 52 public charter schools in the city.[234] Due to the perceived problems with the traditional public school system, enrollment in public charter schools had by 2007 steadily increased.[235] As of 2010, D.C., charter schools had a total enrollment of about 32,000, a 9% increase from the prior year.[231] The district is also home to 92 private schools, which enrolled approximately 18,000 students in 2008.[236] The District of Columbia Public Library operates 25 neighborhood locations including the landmark Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library.[237] Higher education See also: List of colleges and universities in Washington, D.C. Georgetown Day at Georgetown University Private universities include American University (AU), the Catholic University of America (CUA), Gallaudet University, George Washington University (GW), Georgetown University (GU), Howard University (HU), the Johns Hopkins University Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), and Trinity Washington University. The Corcoran College of Art and Design, the oldest art school in the capital, was absorbed into the George Washington University in 2014, now serving as its college of arts. The University of the District of Columbia (UDC) is a public land-grant university providing undergraduate and graduate education. D.C. residents may also be eligible for a grant of up to $10,000 per year to offset the cost of tuition at any public university in the country.[238] The district is known for its medical research institutions such as Washington Hospital Center and the Children's National Medical Center, as well as the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. In addition, the city is home to three medical schools and associated teaching hospitals at George Washington, Georgetown, and Howard universities.[239] Infrastructure Transportation Main article: Transportation in Washington, D.C. A Blue Line train at Farragut West, an underground station on the Washington Metro There are 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of streets, parkways, and avenues in the district.[240] Due to the freeway revolts of the 1960s, much of the proposed interstate highway system through the middle of Washington was never built. Interstate 95 (I-95), the nation's major east coast highway, therefore bends around the district to form the eastern portion of the Capital Beltway. A portion of the proposed highway funding was directed to the region's public transportation infrastructure instead.[241] The interstate highways that continue into Washington, including I-66 and I-395, both terminate shortly after entering the city.[242] The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) operates the Washington Metro, the city's rapid transit system, as well as Metrobus. Both systems serve the district and its suburbs. Metro opened on March 27, 1976 and, as of 2014[update], consists of 91 stations and 117 miles (188 km) of track.[243] With an average of about one million trips each weekday, Metro is the second-busiest rapid transit system in the country. Metrobus serves more than 400,000 riders each weekday and is the nation's fifth-largest bus system.[244] The city also operates its own DC Circulator bus system, which connects commercial areas within central Washington.[245] Washington Union Station is one of the busiest rail stations in the United States. Union Station is the city's main train station and services approximately 70,000 people each day. It is Amtrak's second-busiest station with 4.6 million passengers annually and is the southern terminus for the Northeast Corridor and Acela Express routes. Maryland's MARC and Virginia's VRE commuter trains and the Metrorail Red Line also provide service into Union Station.[246] Following renovations in 2011, Union Station became Washington's primary intercity bus transit center.[247] Three major airports serve the district. The closest is Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which is about 5 miles from the city and is primarily reserved for domestic flights, but is the least busy in the region. The busiest by international flights is Washington Dulles International Airport located about 24 miles away from the city center,[248] and the busiest by total passenger boardings is Baltimore/Washington International Airport, about 30 miles from the city. Each of these three airports also serves as a hub for a major American airline: Reagan is a small hub for American Airlines, Dulles is a major hub for United Airlines and Star Alliance partners, and BWI is a major focus city for Southwest Airlines.

According to a 2010 study, Washington-area commuters spent 70 hours a year in traffic delays, which tied with Chicago for having the nation's worst road congestion.[249] However, 37% of Washington-area commuters take public transportation to work, the second-highest rate in the country.[250] An additional 12% of D.C. commuters walked to work, 6% carpooled, and 3% traveled by bicycle in 2010.[251] A 2011 study by Walk Score found that Washington was the seventh-most walkable city in the country with 80% of residents living in neighborhoods that are not car dependent.[252] In 2013, the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria metropolitan statistical area (MSA) had the eighth lowest percentage of workers who commuted by private automobile (75.7 percent), with 8 percent of area workers traveling via rail transit.[253] An expected 32% increase in transit usage within the district by 2030 has spurred the construction of a new DC Streetcar system to interconnect the city's neighborhoods.[254] An additional Metro line that will connect Washington to Dulles airport is expected to open by July 2021 at the earliest.[needs update][255][256] The district is part of the regional Capital Bikeshare program. Started in 2010, it is one of the largest bicycle sharing systems in the country with more than 4,351 bicycles and more than 395 stations,[257] all provided by PBSC Urban Solutions. By 2012, the city's network of marked bicycle lanes covered 56 miles (90 km) of streets.[258] Utilities The Capitol Power Plant, built to supply energy for the U.S. Capitol Complex, is under the jurisdiction of the Architect of the Capitol. The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (i.e., WASA or D.C. Water) is an independent authority of the D.C. government that provides drinking water and wastewater collection in Washington. WASA purchases water from the historic Washington Aqueduct, which is operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. The water, sourced from the Potomac River, is treated and stored in the city's Dalecarlia, Georgetown, and McMillan reservoirs. The aqueduct provides drinking water for a total of 1.1 million people in the district and Virginia, including Arlington, Falls Church, and a portion of Fairfax County.[259] The authority also provides sewage treatment services for an additional 1.6 million people in four surrounding Maryland and Virginia counties.[260] Pepco is the city's electric utility and services 793,000 customers in the district and suburban Maryland.[261] An 1889 law prohibits overhead wires within much of the historic City of Washington. As a result, all power lines and telecommunication cables are located underground in downtown Washington, and traffic signals are placed at the edge of the street.[262] A plan announced in 2013 would bury an additional 60 miles (97 km) of primary power lines throughout the district.[263] Washington Gas is the city's natural gas utility and serves more than a million customers in the district and its suburbs. Incorporated by Congress in 1848, the company installed the city's first gas lights in the Capitol, the White House, and along Pennsylvania Avenue.[264] See also United States portal Index of Washington, D.C.–related articles Outline of Washington, D.C. List of people from Washington, D.C. Notes ^ By 1790, the Southern states had largely repaid their overseas debts from the Revolutionary War. The Northern states had not, and wanted the federal government to take over their outstanding liabilities. Southern Congressmen agreed to the plan in return for establishing the new national capital at their preferred site on the Potomac River.[22] ^ The Residence Act allowed the President to select a location within Maryland as far east as the Anacostia River. However, Washington shifted the federal territory's borders to the southeast to include the city of Alexandria at the District's southern tip. In 1791, Congress amended the Residence Act to approve the new site, including territory ceded by Virginia.[23] ^ Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the expected highest and lowest temperature readings at any point during the year or given month) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020. ^ Official records for Washington, D.C. were kept at 24th and M Streets NW from January 1871 to June 1945, and at Reagan National Airport since July 1945.[89] ^ Apportionment totals are collected by combining Resident and Overseas population. (For D.C., this is 689545 residents and 1988 overseas population. ^ Until 1890, the Census Bureau counted the City of Washington, Georgetown, and unincorporated portions of Washington County as three separate areas. The data provided in this article from before 1890 are calculated as if the District of Columbia were a single municipality as it is today. Population data for each city prior to 1890 are available.[110] ^ The territories of the United States have the highest poverty rates in the United States.[134] ^ These figures count adherents, meaning all full members, their children, and others who regularly attend services. In all of the District, 55% of the population is adherent to any particular religion. References ^ Imhoff, Gary (October 1999). ""Our Official Songs"". DC Watch.

In response, governments around the world have committed at least $12 trillion in stimulus to COVID-19 recovery, much of it focused on immediate needs like health, food security and jobs. Yet countries must also focus on building their economies for tomorrow — economies that are resilient to global health crises, economic shocks and climate change. By prioritizing COVID-19 stimulus that tackles multiple challenges, countries can build back in a way that is more inclusive, sustainable and resilient. So far, too many countries are still focusing on the past — more stimulus funds are going to fossil fuels than to clean energy. But there are also promising examples of green recovery. Nigeria, the largest oil and gas producer in Africa, is one nation taking steps toward a sustainable economic recovery. By providing stimulus funding for clean energy, supporting women-owned businesses and reforming fossil fuel subsidies in a fair way, Nigeria has an opportunity to build a more inclusive, equitable and sustainable economy. The economic shock created by the pandemic is expected to trigger Nigeria’s worst recession in four decades. Nigeria’s economy shrank 6% in the second quarter of 2020, the first contraction since the first quarter of 2017 and the steepest since the first quarter of 2004. In addition to grappling with the pandemic, Nigeria is also on the front lines of climate change. Rising temperatures make the country more susceptible to disease, food and water shortages and extreme weather events, all of which could exacerbate public health crises such as COVID-19 in the future. Nigeria’s stimulus package can tackle both crises simultaneously, offering the world an example of what stimulus packages can do provided they are used smartly and strategically. Stimulus For Clean Energy and Small Businesses To address the economic challenges of the pandemic, Nigeria’s federal government approved the $5.9 billion (N23 trillion) Nigerian Economic Sustainability Plan in July 2020. The plan costs roughly 1% of GDP and is intended to stimulate and diversify the economy, retain and create jobs and extend more protections to the poor. The recovery plan includes investments in clean energy, agriculture and infrastructure. The most noteworthy piece of green spending is a $619 million commitment to the Solar Homes Systems Project, which will help install solar home systems for up to 5 million households, serving about 25 million individual Nigerians who are not currently connected to the national grid. It also provides monetary incentives for private solar installers and aims to create more domestic jobs in the solar industry. This is one of the largest renewable energy COVID-19 stimulus interventions from a middle- or low-income country to date and is intended to increase energy access and equity. The Economic Sustainability Plan also includes a National Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSMEs) Survival Fund to cushion the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and create an environment for small businesses to thrive. MSMEs are the engine of the Nigerian economy; there are over 37 million MSMEs in Nigeria that contribute nearly 48% of the nation's GDP. COVID-19 has severely constrained MSMEs in Nigeria, with many either laying off staff or going out of business. The MSME Survival Fund will support the private sector to help diversify the economy, with a particular focus on women. Sixty percent of the MSME Survival Fund has been reserved for women entrepreneurs, who make up at least 41% of micro-businesses in the country. These interventions will help to empower women and close the gender gap, promote gender equality and equal representation and build a fairer Nigeria. More Room For Sustainability However, there is more to be done to reduce emissions and dependency on fossil fuels, strengthen climate change adaptation and put Nigeria’s post-COVID-19 economy on a trajectory of green and resilient development. While investment in solar accounts for only 10% of the entire stimulus plan, there are opportunities to embed green recovery and resilience in the rest of the package. For example, the plan proposes an agricultural program to significantly increase the acreage under cultivation — which is expected to create jobs for thousands of young people — and implements measures that guarantee steady income for farmers. This program should incorporate climate-smart agriculture strategies such as drought-resistant crops and land and water management to achieve emissions reductions and adaptation commitments made in Nigeria’s climate pledge and its 2016-2020 Agriculture Promotion Policy. The plan also invests in public works such as roads and promotes natural gas, which Nigeria sees as a bridge from more polluting fossil fuels to clean energy. As it makes these investments, Nigeria needs to ensure that it doesn’t lock into an emissions-intensive pathway and forget to build in resilience to climate change. The Nigerian government pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 20% below business as usual by 2030 under its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and identified several climate adaptation priorities under its National Adaptation Strategy. Nigeria should aim to mainstream these targets and priorities into national budgets and its COVID-19 economic recovery package and look for opportunities to enhance its climate ambition as it invests in long-term growth and jobs. Reforming Fossil Fuel Subsidies and Economic Diversification Nigeria is also taking broader steps to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. It is one of only a few countries so far to remove fossil fuel subsidies during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of the reforms. Leaders made the decision due to the recent drop in oil prices and a need for funds to manage the pandemic and the economy at large. The subsidy removal is expected to save the government at least $2 billion a year. The removal of fossil fuel subsidies is promising, but will only work if substantial efforts are made to ensure that these reforms do not negatively impact the most vulnerable. In the past, removal of fossil fuel subsidies in Nigeria led to mass protests because it was done too quickly and may have widened the wealth gap in a steeply unequal country. Subsidy removals must be designed in a way so as not to damage trust between the government and the people. Provisions to support the poor should oil prices rise again must be carefully thought out and put in place before subsidies are removed, rather than added as an afterthought. The government should go beyond subsidy removal to implement reforms that do not widen inequality, such as expanding its cash transfer program to accommodate more poor families. Nigeria is Africa’s biggest crude producer: oil accounts for 80% of its exports and 50% of government revenue. The massive drop in oil prices is a further call for Nigeria to diversify its economy. Nigeria’s oil sector recorded negative growth in the second quarter of 2020 and had stockpiles of unsold crude in April and May 2020. Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Timipre Sylva said that current challenges in the oil and gas industry are “a wakeup call for Nigeria to increase efforts and reduce its dependence on oil."" Nigeria is already working to diversify the agricultural sector and incentivize in-country manufacturing of solar infrastructure. It will be important to avoid stranded assets by continuing to diversify the economy away from fossil fuels and carefully plan investment in renewables to line up with transmission capacity. Looking Forward The Economic Sustainability Plan and Nigeria’s Medium Term Expenditure Framework (2021-2023) both emphasize the need to diversify Nigeria’s economy and ensure growth in non-oil exports. Nigeria is showing what green recovery can mean for countries that are most impacted by the climate crisis. By investing in renewable capacity, energy access and equity, women’s empowerment, climate-smart agriculture and economic diversification, Nigeria can set itself on a path to build back fairer, stronger and cleaner. This is the time to reset Nigeria’s economy. The views expressed here do not represent the views of the African Development Bank.

The publication provides a comprehensive overview of steel industry activities, stretching from crude steel production to apparent steel use, from indications of global steel trade flows to iron ore production and trade. Edwin Basson, Director General, worldsteel, said, ‘We have said many times that the steel industry is at the heart of the global economy and equally so at the core of our sustainable modern society. Despite the influence of the pandemic, through its different regional impacts, the global steel industry was fortunate to end 2020 with only a minor contraction in steel demand. Steel use in China expanded while it contracted in the rest of the world. We look forward to normalisation in demand during 2021, owing to steady progress on vaccines and changed behaviour in the global society. We believe that the pandemic has accelerated some key trends, which will bring about shifts in steel demand. The steel industry will see exciting opportunities from rapid developments through digitisation and automation, infrastructure initiatives, reorganisation of urban centres and energy transformation.’ # Ends # Notes to Editors: The World Steel Association (worldsteel) is one of the largest and most dynamic industry associations in the world, with members in every major steel-producing country. worldsteel represents steel producers, national and regional steel industry associations, and steel research institutes. Members represent around 85% of global steel production.

"Small and medium-sized enterprises - Wikipedia Small and medium-sized enterprises From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are businesses whose personnel numbers fall below certain limits. The abbreviation ""SME"" is used by international organizations such as the World Bank, the European Union, the United Nations and the World Trade Organization (WTO). In any given national economy, SMEs sometimes outnumber large companies by a wide margin and also employ many more people.[1] For example, Australian SMEs make up 98% of all Australian businesses, produce one-third of the total GDP and employ 4.7 million people. In Chile, in the commercial year 2014, 98.5% of the firms were classified as SMEs.[2] In Tunisia, the self-employed workers alone account for about 28% of the total non-farm employment and firms with fewer than 100 employees account for about 62% of total employment.[3] The United States' SMEs generate half of all U.S. jobs, but only 40% of GDP.[4] In developing countries, smaller (micro) and informal firms, have a larger share[of what?] than in developed countries.[citation needed][5] SMEs are also said[by whom?] to be responsible for driving innovation and competition in many[which?] economic sectors. Although they create more new jobs than large firms, SMEs also suffer the majority of job destruction/contraction.[6] Contents 1 Overview 2 Legal boundary on SMEs around the world 2.1 Africa 2.1.1 Egypt 2.1.2 Kenya 2.1.3 Nigeria 2.1.4 Somalia 2.1.5 South Africa 2.2 Asia 2.2.1 India 2.2.2 Indonesia 2.2.3 Bangladesh 2.2.4 Singapore 2.3 Europe 2.3.1 European Union 2.3.2 Poland 2.3.3 United Kingdom 2.3.4 Switzerland 2.4 North America 2.4.1 Canada 2.4.2 Mexico 2.4.3 United States 2.5 Oceania 2.5.1 Australia 2.5.2 New Zealand 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Overview[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (January 2017) SMEs are important for economic and social reasons, given the sectors role in employment. Due to their sizes, SME are heavily influenced by their Chief Executive Officer, a.k.a. CEOs. The CEOs of SMEs often are the founders, owners, and manager of the SMEs. The duties of the CEO in SME are difficult, and mirror those of the CEO of a large company: the CEO needs to strategically allocate her/his time, energy, and assets to direct the SMEs. Typically, the CEO is the strategist, champion and leader for developing the SME or the prime reason for the business failing[citation needed]. This definition is provided in Section 7 of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 (MSMED Act) and was notified in September 2006. The Act provides for classification of enterprises based on their investment size and the nature of the activity undertaken by that enterprise. As per MSMED Act, enterprises are classified into two categories - manufacturing enterprises and service enterprises. For each of these categories, a definition is given to explain what constitutes a micro enterprise or a small enterprise or a medium enterprise. What is not coming under the above three categories would be considered as a large scale enterprise in India. At the employee level, Petrakis and Kostis (2012) explore the role of interpersonal trust and knowledge in the number of small and medium enterprises. They conclude that knowledge positively affects the number of SMEs, which in turn, positively affects interpersonal trust. Note that the empirical results indicate that interpersonal trust does not affect the number of SMEs. Therefore, although knowledge development can reinforce SMEs, trust becomes widespread in a society when the number of SMEs is greater.[7] Legal boundary on SMEs around the world[edit] Multilateral organizations have been criticized for using one measure for all.[8][9] The legal boundary of SMEs around the world vary, and below is a list of the upper limits of SMEs in some countries. Africa[edit] This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Egypt[edit] Most of Egypt's businesses are small-sized, with 97 percent employing fewer than 10 workers, according to census data released by state-run statistics body CAPMAS. Medium-sized enterprises with 10 to 50 employees account for around 2.7 percent of total businesses. However, big businesses with over 50 employees account for 0.4 percent of all enterprises nationwide. The data is part of Egypt's 2012/13 economic census on establishments ranging from small stalls to big enterprises. Economic activity outside the establishments – like street vendors and farmers, for example – were excluded from the census. The results show that Egypt is greatly lacking in medium-sized businesses. Seventy percent of the country's 24 million businesses have only one or two employees. But less than 0.1 percent – only 784 businesses – employ between 45 and 49 people. Kenya[edit] In Kenya, the term changed to MSME, which stands for ""micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises"". For micro-enterprises, the minimum number of employees is up to 10 employees. For small enterprises, it is from 10 to 50. For medium enterprises, it is from 50 to 100. no Nigeria[edit] The Central Bank of Nigeria defines small and medium enterprises in Nigeria according to asset base and number of staff employed. The criteria are an asset base that is between N5 million to N500 million, and a staff strength that is between 11 and 100 employees.[citation needed][10] Somalia[edit] In Somalia, the term is SME (for ""small, medium, and micro enterprises""); elsewhere in Africa, MSME stands for ""micro, small, and medium enterprises"". An SME is defined as a small business that has more than 30 employees but less than 250 employees. South Africa[edit] In the National Small Business Amendment Act 2004,[11] micro-businesses in the different sectors, varying from the manufacturing to the retail sectors, are defined as businesses with five or fewer employees and a turnover of up to R100,000 ZAR. Very small businesses employ between 6 and 20 employees, while small businesses employ between 21 and 50 employees. The upper limit for turnover in a small business varies from R1 million in the Agricultural sector to R13 million in the Catering, Accommodations and other Trade sectors as well as in the Manufacturing sector, with a maximum of R32 million in the Wholesale Trade sector. Medium-sized businesses usually employ up to 200 people (100 in the Agricultural sector), and the maximum turnover varies from R5 million in the Agricultural sector to R51 million in the Manufacturing sector and R64 million in the Wholesale Trade, Commercial Agents and Allied Services sector. A comprehensive definition of an SME in South Africa is, therefore, an enterprise with one or more of the following characteristics: Fewer than 200 employees, Annual turnover of less than R64 million, Capital assets of less than R10 million, Direct managerial involvement by owners[12] Asia[edit] India[edit] India defines Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises based on dual criteria of Investment and Turnover. In June 2020, India has updated the definition as follows:[13] Sr No Classification Criteria (in ₹) 1 Micro Enterprises Investment <= 1 cr and Turnover <= 5 cr 2 Small Enterprises Investment <= 10 cr and Turnover <= 50 cr 3 Medium Enterprises Investment <= 50 cr and Turnover <= 250 cr Businesses that are declared as MSMEs and within specific sectors and criteria can then apply for ""priority sector"" lending to help with business expenses; banks have annual targets set by the Prime Minister's Task Force on MSMEs for year-on-year increases of lending to various categories of MSMEs.[14] MSME is considered key contributor in India's growth and contribute 48% in India's total export.[15] Indonesia[edit] In Indonesia, the government defines micro, small, and medium enterprises (Indonesian: usaha mikro kecil menengah, UMKM) based on their assets and revenues according to Law No. 20/2008:[16] Type Maximum assets, Rp Maximum revenue, Rp Micro 50,000,000 300,000,000 Small 500,000,000 2,500,000,000 Medium 10,000,000,000 50,000,000,000 An annual revenue of Rp 50 billion is approximately equal to US$3.7 million as of November 2017. Bangladesh[edit] In Bangladesh, Bangladesh Bank defines Small and medium enterprises based on Fixed Asset, Employed Manpower and Yearly turn over and they are definitely not Public Limited Co. and requires these characteristics - Serial No Sector Fixed Asset other than Land and Building (Tk) SE (Small Enterprises) & ME (Medium Enterprises) Employed Manpower Yearly Turn Over (Tk) (N/A-Not Applicable) 01 Services For SE 1000,000 - 200,00,000 & For ME 200,00,000 - 30,00,00,000 SE - 16-50 & ME - 51-120 N/A 02 Business For SE 1000,000 - 200,00,000 SE - 16-50 SE 10,000,000-120,000,000 03 Industrial For SE 7,500,000 - 150,000,000 For Me 150,000,000 - 500,000,000 SE - 31-120 & ME - 121-300 N/A Singapore[edit] With effect from 1 April 2011, the definition of SMEs is businesses with annual sales turnover of not more than $100 million or employing no more than 200 staff.[17] Europe[edit] European Union[edit] Small companies are important to the European economy as they account for 99.8% of non-financial enterprises in the European Union, and employ two-thirds of the workforce in the EU. [18][19] The criteria for defining the size of a business differ from country to country, with many countries having programs of business rate reduction and financial subsidy for SMEs. According to the European Commission,[20] SMEs are enterprises which meet the following definition of staff headcount and either the turnover or balance sheet total definitions: Company category Staff headcount Turnover Balance sheet total Medium-sized < 250 ≤ €50 million ≤ €43 million Small < 50 ≤ €10 million ≤ €10 million Micro < 10 ≤ €2 million ≤ €2 million In July 2011, the European Commission said it would open a consultation on the definition of SMEs in 2012. A consultation document was issued on 6 February 2018 and the consultation period closed on 6 May 2018. As of November 2019[update] no conclusions or responses have yet emerged.[21] In Europe, there are three broad parameters which define SMEs: Micro-enterprises have up to 10 employees Small enterprises have up to 50 employees Medium-sized enterprises have up to 250 employees.[22] The European definition of SME follows: ""The category of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is made up of enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding 50 million euro, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding 43 million euro.""[23] In order to prepare for an evaluation and revision of some features of the small and medium-sized enterprises definition European Union established public consultation period from 6 February 2018 to 6 May 2018. Public consultation is available for all EU member country citizens and organizations. Especially, national and regional authorities, enterprises, business associations or organizations, venture capital providers, research and academic institutions, and individual citizens are expected as the main contributors.[24] EU member states have had individual definitions of what constitutes an SME. For example, the definition in Germany had a limit of 255 employees, while in Belgium it could have been 100. The result is that while a Belgian business of 249 employees would be taxed at full rate in Belgium, it would nevertheless be eligible for SME subsidy under a European-labelled programme. SMEs are a crucial element in the supplier network of large enterprises which are already on their way towards Industry 4.0.[25] According to German economist Hans-Heinrich Bass, ""empirical research on SME as well as policies to promote SME have a long tradition in [West] Germany, dating back into the 19th century. Until the mid-20th century most researchers considered SME as an impediment to further economic development and SME policies were thus designed in the framework of social policies. Only the Ordoliberalism school, the founding fathers of Germany's social market economy, discovered their strengths, considered SME as a solution to mid-20th century economic problems (mass unemployment, abuse of economic power), and laid the foundations for non-selective (functional) industrial policies to promote SMEs.""[26] Only around 20% of European SMEs are substantially digitalized, compared to almost 50% of major businesses.[27][28] Small and medium-sized companies make up 56.2% of the non-financial sector. Smaller companies account for more than 60% of the value contributed to the non-financial sector in Belgium, Italy, and Spain, three of the nations worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. [29][30] An estimated 50% of Europe's small firms may fail because they lack the substantial financial reserves required to weather the crisis.[31][32] Poland[edit] The SME sector in Poland generates almost 50% of the GDP, and out of that, for instance, in 2011, micro companies generated 29.6%, small companies 7.7%, and medium companies 10.4% (big companies 24.0%; other entities 16.5%, and revenues from customs duties and taxes generated 11.9%). In 2011, out of the total of 1,784,603 entities operating in Poland, merely 3,189 were classified as ""large"", so 1,781,414 were micro, small, or medium. SMEs employed 6.3 million people out of the total of 9.0 million of labour employed in the private sector. In Poland in 2011 was 36.2 SMEs per 1,000 of inhabitants.[33] United Kingdom[edit] In the UK, a company is defined as being an SME if it meets two out of three criteria: it has a turnover of less than £25m, it has fewer than 250 employees, it has gross assets of less than £12.5m.[34] Very small companies are called in the UK micro-entities, which have simpler financial reporting requirements. Such micro-enterprises must meet any two of the following criteria: balance sheet £316,000 or less; turnover £632,000 or less; employees 10 or less.[35] Many small and medium-sized businesses form part of the UK's currently growing Mittelstand, or Brittelstand as it is also sometimes named.[36] These are businesses in Britain that are not only small or medium but also have a much broader set of values and more elastic definition. The Department for Business Innovation and Skills estimated that at the start of 2014, 99.3% of UK private sector businesses were SMEs, with their £1.6 trillion annual turnover accounting for 47% of private sector turnover.[37][38] In order to support SMEs, the UK government set a target in 2010 ""that 25% of government’s spend, either directly or in supply chains, goes to SMEs by 2015""; it achieved this by 2013.[39] Switzerland[edit] In Switzerland, the Federal Statistical Office defines small and medium-sized enterprises as companies with less than 250 employees.[40] The categories are the following:[40] Microentreprises: 1 to 9 employees. Small enterprises: 10 to 49 employees. Medium-sized enterprises: 50 to 249 employees. Large enterprises: 250 employees or more. North America[edit] Canada[edit] Industry Canada defines a small business as one with fewer than 100 paid employees and a medium-sized business as one with at least 100 and fewer than 500 employees. As of December 2012, there were 1,107,540 employer businesses in Canada, of rally. Canadian Controlled private corporations receive a 17% reduction in the tax rate on taxable income from active businesses up to $500,000. This small business deduction is reduced for corporations whose taxable capital exceeding $10M, and is completely eliminated for corporations whose taxable capital exceeds $15M.[41] It has been estimated that almost $2 trillion of Canadian SMEs will be coming up for sale over the next decade which is twice as large as the assets of the top 1,000 Canadian pension plans and approximately the same size as Canadian annual GDP.[42] Mexico[edit] The small and medium-sized companies in Mexico are called PYMEs, which is a direct translation of SMEs. But there's another categorization in the country called MiPyMEs. The MiPyMEs are micro, small and medium-sized businesses, with an emphasis on micro which are one man companies or a type of freelance. United States[edit] In the United States, the Small Business Administration sets small business criteria based on industry, ownership structure, revenue and number of employees (which in some circumstances may be as high as 1500, although the cap is typically 500).[43] Both the US and the EU generally use the same threshold of fewer than 10 employees for small offices (SOHO).[citation needed] Also in the United States, small and medium-sized manufacturers are referred to as SMMs,[44] which the US Department of Energy classifies as having gross annual sales below $100 million, fewer than 500 employees at the plant site, and annual energy bills more than $100,000 but less than $2.5 million.[45] Oceania[edit] Australia[edit] This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In Australia, a SME has 200 or fewer employees. Micro Businesses have 1–4 employees, small businesses 5–19, medium businesses 20–199, and large businesses 200+.[46] Australian SMEs make up 98% of all Australian businesses, produced one third of total GDP, and employ 4.7 million people. SMEs represent 90 per cent of all goods exporters and over 60% of services exporters.[47] New Zealand[edit] In New Zealand, 99% of businesses employ 50 or less staff, and the official definition of a small business is one with 19 or fewer employees.[48][49] It is estimated that approximately 28% of New Zealand's gross domestic product is produced by companies with fewer than 20 employees.[50] See also[edit] Confédération Européenne des Associations de Petites et Moyennes Entreprises (CEA-PME), an international federation of SME associations Environmental regulation of small and medium enterprises Hidden champions Mittelstand Small and medium enterprises in Mexico Small business References[edit] ^ Compare: Fischer, Eileen; Reuber, Rebecca (2000).

OverviewSmall and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play a major role in most economies, particularly in developing countries. SMEs account for the majority of businesses worldwide and are important contributors to job creation and global economic development. They represent about 90% of businesses and more than 50% of employment worldwide. Formal SMEs contribute up to 40% of national income (GDP) in emerging economies. These numbers are significantly higher when informal SMEs are included.  According to our estimates, 600 million jobs will be needed by 2030 to absorb the growing global workforce, which makes SME development a high priority for many governments around the world. In emerging markets, most formal jobs are generated by SMEs, which create 7 out of 10 jobs. However, access to finance is a key constraint to SME growth, it is the second most cited obstacle facing SMEs to grow their businesses in emerging markets and developing countries. image SMEs are less likely to be able to obtain bank loans than large firms; instead, they rely on internal funds, or cash from friends and family, to launch and initially run their enterprises. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) estimates that 65 million firms, or 40% of formal micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in developing countries, have an unmet financing need of $5.2 trillion every year, which is equivalent to 1.4 times the current level of the global MSME lending. East Asia And Pacific accounts for the largest share (46%) of the total global finance gap and is followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (23%) and Europe and Central Asia (15%). The gap volume varies considerably region to region. Latin America and the Caribbean and the Middle East and North Africa regions, in particular, have the highest proportion of the finance gap compared to potential demand, measured at 87% and 88%, respectively. About half of formal SMEs don’t have access to formal credit. The financing gap is even larger when micro and informal enterprises are taken into account. Formal MSME Finance Gap in Developing Countries What We DoA key area of the World Bank Group’s work is to improve SMEs’ access to finance and find innovative solutions to unlock sources of capital.Our approach is holistic, combining advisory and lending services to clients to increase the contribution that SMEs can make to the economy including underserved segments such as women owned SMEs.Advisory and Policy Support for SME finance mainly includes diagnostics, implementation support, global advocacy and knowledge sharing of good practice. For example we provide;Financial sector assessments to determine areas of improvement in regulatory and policy aspects enabling increased responsible SME access to finance Implementation support of initiatives such as development of enabling environment, design and set up of credit guarantee schemesImproving credit infrastructure (credit reporting systems, secured transactions and collateral registries, and insolvency regimes) which can lead to greater SME access to finance.Introducing innovation in SME finance such as e-lending platforms, use of alternative data for credit decisioning, e-invoicing, e-factoring and supply chain financing.Policy work, analytical work, and other Advisory Services can also be provided in support of SME finance activities.Advocacy for SME finance at global level through participating and supporting G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion, Financial Stability Board, International Credit Committee for Credit Reporting on SME Finance related issues.Knowledge management tools and flagship publications on good practice, successful models and policy frameworksLending Operations:SME Lines of Credit provide dedicated bank financing – frequently for longer tenors than are generally available in the market – to support SMEs for investment, growth, export, and diversification.Partial Credit Guarantee Schemes (PCGs) – the design of PCGs is crucial to SMEs’ success, and support can be provided to design and capitalize such facilities.Early Stage Innovation Finance provides equity and debt/quasi-debt to start up or high growth firms which may otherwise not be able to access bank financing.Results of Our WorkEarly-Stage SME FinanceIn Lebanon, the Innovative Small and Medium Enterprises (iSME) project is a $30 million investment lending operation providing equity co-investments in innovative young firms in addition to a grant funding window for seed stage firms. As of August 2019, iSME’s co-investment fund has invested $10.23 million across 22 investments and has been able to leverage $25.47 million in co-financing, demonstrating its ability to crowd in private sector financing and expand the market for early stage equity finance in Lebanon. To date, 60 out of 174 grantees had leveraged the iSME funding to raise a total of $13.1 million from various funding sources, a leverage ratio of 5.3 times. Overall, stakeholders’ consultations suggest that the iSME project could play an even larger role in the future financing of the Venture Capital (VC) sector by supporting existing VCs and emerging players, including increasing attention on a fund of funds approach, which could also cover growth funds (later stage and private equity). In India, our MSME Growth, Innovation and Inclusive Finance Project improved access to finance for MSMEs in three vital but underserved segments: early stage/startups, services, and manufacturing. A credit line of $500 million, provided to the Small Industry Development Bank of India (SIDBI), was designed to provide an affordable longer-term source of funding for underserved MSMEs. Technical assistance of about $3.7 million complemented the lending component and focused on capacity building of SIDBI and the participating financial institutions (PFIs). In addition to directly financing MSMEs, disbursing a total of $265 million in loans, the project pushed the frontiers of MSME financing through the development of innovative lending methods that reduced turnaround time, reached more underserved MSMEs, and crowded in more private sector financing. It also reached new clients, women-owned MSMEs, and MSMEs in low-income states. The project supported SIDBI to scale-up of the Fund of Funds for Startups, which aims to indirectly disburse $1.5 billion to startups by 2025. SIDBI’s “contactless lending” platform, a digital MSME lending aggregator and matchmaking platform, has crowded in $1.9 billion of private sector financing for MSMEs, making it the largest online lender in India.Lines of CreditIn Jordan, two World Bank Group’s lines of credit aim to increase access to finance for MSMEs and ultimately contribute to job creation. The $70 million line of credit encouraged the growth and expansion of new and existing enterprises, increasing outreach to MSMEs, 58% of which were located outside of Amman and 73% were managed by women. The line of credit directed 22% of total funds to start-ups. The project financed 8,149 MSMEs, creating 7,682 jobs, of which 79% employed youth and 42% hired women. The additional financing of $50 Million is progressing well towards achieving its intended objective. $45.2 million has been on-lent to 3,345 MSMEs through nine participating banks. The project is especially benefiting women, who represent 77% of project beneficiaries, and youth (48% of project beneficiaries), and increasing geographical outreach, as 65% of MSMEs are in Governorates outside of Amman.In Nigeria, the Development Finance Project supports the establishment of the Development Bank of Nigeria (DBN), a wholesale development finance institution that will provide long-term financing and partial credit guarantees to eligible financial intermediaries for on-lending to MSMEs. The project also includes technical assistance to DBN and participating commercial banks in support of downscaling their operations to the underserved MSME segment. As of May 2019, the Development Bank of Nigeria credit line to PFIs for on-lending to MSMEs has disbursed US$243.7 million, reaching nearly 50,000 end-borrowers, of which 70% were women, through 7 banks and 10 microfinance banks.Partial Credit GuaranteesIn Morocco, the MSME Development project aimed to improve access to finance for MSMEs by supporting the provision of credit guarantees by enabling the provider of partial credit guarantees in the Moroccan financial system to scale up its existing MSME guarantee products and introduce a new guarantee product geared towards the very small enterprises (VSEs). As a result of the project, the number and volume of MSME loans are estimated to have increased by 88% and 18%, respectively, since the end of 2011. Cumulative volume of loans backed by the guarantees during the life of the project is estimated at $3.28 billion. With significantly increased lending supported by guarantees, PFIs were able to continue building their knowledge of MSME customers, refining their systems to serve them more effectively and efficiently. Owing to guarantees, many first-time borrowers were able to generate credit history, which made it easier for them to obtain loans in future.Supporting Women-Owned SMEsIn Ethiopia, the Women Entrepreneurship Development Project (WEDP) is an IDA operation providing loans and business training for growth-oriented women entrepreneurs in Ethiopia. After identifying a persistent ‘missing middle’ financing gap for women entrepreneurs in Ethiopia, WEDP launched as a microfinance institutions’ (MFIs) upscaling operation, helping Ethiopia’s leading MFIs introduce larger, individual-liability loan products tailored to women entrepreneurs. WEDP loans are complemented through provision of innovative, mindset-oriented business training to women entrepreneurs. As of October 2019, more than 14,000 women entrepreneurs took loans and over 20,000 participated in business training provided by WEDP.  66% of WEDP clients were first-time borrowers. As a result of the project, participating MFIs increased the average loan size by 870% to $11,500, reduced the collateral requirements from an average of 200% of the value of the loan to 125%, and started disbursing $30.2 million of their own funds as WEDP loans. The average WEDP loan has resulted in an increase of over 40% in annual profits and nearly 56% in net employment for Ethiopian women entrepreneurs. In Bangladesh, the Access to Finance for Women SMEs Project aims to create an enabling environment to expand access to finance to women SMEs (WSME) by supporting the establishment of credit guarantee scheme (CGS), issuance of SME Finance Policy, and strengthening capacity of the regulator and sector. The project supported the issuance of Bangladesh’s maiden SME Finance Policy: stepping stone for boosting SME financing. Bangladesh’s first comprehensive SME Finance Policy was launched in September 2019 through concerted efforts in high-level upstream work, enhancement of the regulator’s capacity, and formulation of key recommendations with a sharper gender lens. In Bangladesh, $2.8 billion financing gap prevails in the MSME sector, where 60% of women SME’s financing needs are unmet, and lack of access to collateral is one of the key hindrances. Bangladesh lacked a single policy with systemic plan to enhance SME finance. With nearly 10 million SMEs contributing to 23% of the GDP, 80% of jobs in the industries sector and 25% of the total labor force, the SME Finance Policy will play a pivotal role in enhance SME financing.LeasingIn Ethiopia and Guinea, the World Bank Group is supporting the local governments in creating an enabling framework which is conducive to launching and growing leasing operations, as well as attracting investors, to increase access to finance for SMEs. It is doing so by working at the macro, mezzo, and micro levels, supporting the governments with legal and regulatory reforms, and working with industry players to create technical partnerships and increase market awareness and capacity. In Ethiopia, the project generated a $200 million credit facility supporting 7 leasing intuitions and introducing 4 new leasing products into the market: hire purchase, finance lease, microleasing and agrileasing. As of June 2019, 7,186 MSMEs have accessed finance valued at over $147 million. The project in Guinea supported the adoption of the national leasing law and the accompanying prudential guidelines for leasing, which in turn, have helped 3 companies to launch leasing operations. To date, these institutions have supported 31 SMEs through the disbursement of leases valued at $25 million.Who We Work WithLeveraging our expert knowledge, we work globally with public stakeholders and private sector intermediaries in partnership with other multilateral and bilateral development organizations to support SME Finance development in emerging markets and developing countries.

"Small & medium-sized enterprises | National Action Plans on Business and Human Rights Skip to content Menu Explore by Country Issue Resources Tools & Guidance HRB Country Guides About Home > Issue > Small & medium-sized enterprises Small & medium-sized enterprises Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are defined as non-subsidiary, independent firms which employ less than a given number of employees. This number varies between countries, with the most frequent upper limit being 250 employees, as in the European Union. However, some countries set the limit at 200 employees, while the United States uses 500 employees. Small firms are generally those with fewer than 50 employees, while micro-enterprises have at most ten, or in some cases five workers. Financial assets can also used to define SMEs; in the European Union, SMEs must have an annual turnover of EUR 40 million or less and/or a balance-sheet valuation not exceeding EUR 27 million. The approximately 400 million SMEs are the backbone of economies around the world. They are the main source of job creation globally, accounting for over 95% of firms and 60%-70% of employment. SMEs generate a large share of new jobs in OECD economies, and even more in the EU, where they represent approximately 99% of all businesses, create around 85% of new jobs and provide two-thirds of the total private sector employment. Similarly, in the Global South, growth in overall employment is generally connected to the development of SMEs. [see, OECD Responsible Business Conduct in Georgia]. Considered key  to ensuring economic growth, innovation, job creation, and social integration, not least thanks to their close relations with employees, the local community, business partners, for example, they also make an integral part of global supply chains, both as buyers and suppliers [e.g., European Commission: SME portal]. The IFC estimates that globally there are roughly 9.34 formal million women-owned SMEs in over 140 assessed countries and also notes that the credit gap for formal women-owned SMEs across all regions is roughly $2872 billion, which is 30 percent of the total credit gap for SMEs. + Read more At the same time, SMEs have specific strengths and weaknesses that may require special policy responses. As new technologies and globalisation reduce the importance of economies of scale in many activities, the potential contribution of smaller firms is enhanced, with many of them being at the forefront of innovative solutions of relevance to human rights (e.g., The LifeStraw). However, many of the traditional problems facing SMEs – lack of financing, difficulties in exploiting technology, constrained managerial capabilities, low productivity, regulatory burdens – become more acute in a globalised, technology-driven environment. The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), Guiding Principle 14, states: “The responsibility of business enterprises to respect human rights applies to all enterprises regardless of their size, sector, operational context, ownership and structure. Nevertheless, the scale and complexity of the means through which enterprises meet that responsibility may vary according to these factors and with the severity of the enterprise’s adverse human rights impacts.” The Commentary to Guiding Principle 14 states that: “[T]he means through which a business enterprise meets its responsibility to respect human rights will be proportional to, among other factors, its size. Small and medium-sized enterprises may have less capacity as well as more informal processes and management structures than larger companies, so their respective policies and processes will take on different forms. But some small and medium-sized enterprises can have severe human rights impacts, which will require corresponding measures regardless of their size. Severity of impacts will be judged by their scale, scope and irremediable character. The means through which a business enterprise meets its responsibility to respect human rights may also vary depending on whether, and the extent to which, it conducts business through a corporate group or individually. However, the responsibility to respect human rights applies fully and equally to all business enterprises.” Despite clear references in the UNGPs and the role they play in the global economy, the importance of SMEs and their key role in creating a paradigm shift in how business is being done, has been largely neglected in the debate on business and human rights [e.g., ILO report.] Only more recently is attention being paid to the support needed by SMEs  to improve working conditions and develop more mature labour relations, such as inexpensive provision of working capital for investment in working conditions and other business practices, as well as training on occupational health and safety standards [e.g., recording of the 2015 UN Forum on Business and Human Rights session on “SMEs, informality and human rights: challenges and solutions”; WebTV]. At the same time, while for being part of the global supply chains, SMEs are often required to integrate and comply with their business partners’ Codes of Conducts, also contributing to behavioral change. While the majority of the guidance to business is better suited for large corporations, various actors undertook efforts to develop materials and guidance aimed particularly at the SMEs, with the purpose of raising awareness, building capacity and to understand the advantages of respecting human rights, for example, cost reduction or retaining and attracting the best staff or improving productivity and performance, or safeguarding the business’ reputation. The UK Equality and Human Rights Commission developed guides tailored to the specific needs of small and medium-sized businesses: “The Equality Act: Guidance for Small Businesses” and “Guide to Business and Human Rights”. In 2012, the European Commission published in all EU languages, “My Business and Human Rights: A Guide to Human Rights for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises”. Additionally, the United Nations Global Compact launched the Communication on Progress (COP) to help small and medium-sized enterprises with limited resources to regularly disclose progress on sustainability within their means. In May 2019, Switzerland published the Making Success Sustainable through Responsible Business Conduct: Human Rights Due Diligence of Swiss SMEs. It provides information for human rights risk assessments and an overview of the steps required to implement human rights due diligence. In order to support women’s empowerment, in 2008, the Dominican Republic adopted a law setting out a program of preferential purchasing to support SMEs and legislated that 20% of purchases through this program should be from businesses run by women. Under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, small & medium-sized enterprises are crucial for the achievement of a number of SDGs including SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth, SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and SDG 12 o(responsible consumption and production). They are also relevant for other SDGs aimed at ensuring poverty reduction and access to markets (e.g., SDG 2 (no hunger)), or decent work (SDG 8) among others.  Some countries have already launched support programmes for SMEs. These include financial support and guidelines such as Japan’s management plan, for SMEs that also help companies link their actions to SDG implementation; and Denmark’s SDG Acceleration for SMEs established in cooperation with UNDP. 8) Decent Work and Economic Growth9) Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure12) Responsible Consumption and Production References SMEs and the Corporate Responsibility to Respect Human Rights, Shift, 2019. What National Action Plans say on Small & medium-sized enterprises Belgium Action point 4 Promote existing qualitative initiatives on human rights and social responsibility Promouvoir les initiatives qualitatives existantes relatives aux droits de l’Homme et à la responsabilité sociétale The federal government explains that the Belgian National Contact Point will organize a seminar targeting the fight against corruption for SMEs with the provision of a practical toolbox prepared in partnership with the Belgian Confederation of Enterprises and the International Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Justice. The Flemish government plans a sustained and sectoral approach to social responsibility as companies operating in the same sector face similar challenges. Thus in consultation with the sectoral organizations, the Flemish authorities will support these organizations and their members in order to sustain their value chains and management of their businesses. In 2016, the Department of Labor and Social Economy will launch a call for the reduction of the difficulties of individual organizations (SMEs, social profit and other organizations) for the determination or for taking social responsibility. On the context of development of SMEs in South Africa, the NAP mentions that the strategy note aims at job creation through the development of SMEs. This priority is based on the recognition that the high unemployment rate in the labor force, especially among young people, is one of the most important underlying causes of inequality in South Africa. The collaboration between Flanders and South Africa therefore provides support services for SMEs in general and in the social economy sector in particular. The Flemish government is funding the project ‘Job creation through SME Development – A knowledge sharing project’. This project has a duration of three years (ends December 2017) and has the objective of creating a better business climate for SMEs by taking initiatives to facilitate the creation and development of SMEs through knowledge exchange, coordination and collaboration between interested parties. Action point 10 Belgium is committed to integrating human rights and corporate social responsibility (CSR) criteria into the local private sector development support strategy of Belgian cooperation La Belgique s’engage à intégrer des critères « droits de l’Homme » et de Responsabilité sociétale des entreprises (RSE) dans la stratégie d’appui au développement du secteur privé local de la coopération belge This point explains that strategy of the Belgian cooperation for development also aims at improving the access to financing for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and capacity building of MSME entrepreneurs. One of BIO’s purposes is to invest, directly or indirectly, in the development of MSMEs and social economy enterprises located in developing countries in the interest of economic progress and social security of these countries, while ensuring an adequate return. Action point 13 Strengthen and monitor the respect for human rights in public procurement Renforcer et contrôler le respect des droits de l’Homme dans les marchés publics The NAP states that the Flemish government intends to emphasize innovation, sustainability, professionalisation and access to SMEs within the Flemish public procurement plan for the period 2016-2020. Action point 14 Evaluate the Belgian label to promote socially responsible production Evaluer le label belge visant à promouvoir la production socialement responsible This point presents “the Belgian label” that was a product label created in 2002 and promulgated by law to promote socially responsible production. While the plan includes a reevaluation of the law, such an assessment will take into account the specificity of SMEs both in the analysis and proposals. Action point 19 Promote best practice of SMEs that adopt responsible supply chain management, especially through the  « CSR Compass » tool Promouvoir les bonnes pratiques des PME qui adoptent une gestion de la chaine d’approvisionnement responsable, notamment grâce à l’outil « CSR Compass » This point has a special focus on SMEs. Actions from the government of Wallonia will include the promoting vis-à-vis companies the ready-made instruments, also covering the CRS compass. Concretely, this will involve setting up workshops for exchanges between companies of the same sector and the creation of a practical guide for SMEs wishing to improve the ethics in their supply chain. Action point 31 Endorse best practice of businesses Mettre en avant les pratiques exemplaires des entreprises The government of Wallonia mentions an engagement that will consist of publishing the initiatives developed by companies and on the other hand Walloon initiatives supporting the adoption of practices respecting human rights by SMEs. Action point 32 Train companies in the field of respect for human rights Former les entreprises dans le domaine du respect des droits de l’Homme This point briefly mentions SMEs in the context of Wallonia’s engagement with educational and public policy initiatives. The NAP mentions that “public policy initiatives may target intermediaries to ensure that human rights issues are permanently and actively integrated into education and training activities. In this respect, a link could be set up with the “training voucher” system of the Walloon Region. The aim of this system is to promote the training of workers engaged in SMEs or self-employed persons in the Walloon Region. To this end, they are invited by the Walloon Region to participate in training courses during or outside normal working hours.” Read more about Belgium Chile Pillar 1: The State Duty to Protect Human Rights Strand 1: Training in the Field of Business and Human Rights Action Point 1.3 (pages 30-31) The Ministry of Labour will: Train businesses (guilds, confederations, associations and SMEs), unions and civil servants on business and human rights, emphasising labour rights.

In line with the above, the General Directorate will encourage the development of specific coordination activities in the committees and promote the development of technical capacities in human rights. Pillar 2: The Corporate Responsibility to Respect Human Rights Strand 2: Promotion of Corporate Due Diligence in the Field of Human Rights Action Point 2.1 (pages 54-55) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through the General Directorate of International Economic Relations, will: Promote human rights in the management of public funds to promote exports carried out by ProChile, through the progressive incorporation of analysis mechanisms helping to ensure that business enterprises having access to the tools offered by this entity respect human rights. Likewise, it will establish, if relevant, requirements about sustainability and respect for human rights, as criteria to choose the business enterprises participating in programmes to promote exports and corporate activities, including SMEs and micro SMEs. Disclose to business enterprises who are members of ProChile the United Nations Guiding Principles, thus helping, in this was and as far as possible, to incorporate them in their activities. It will do this through information available in the website, talks or sets of tools to strengthen their capabilities, and/or through the publication of handbooks containing the Guiding Principles or another suitable instrument, with special focus on information and training provided to SMEs. Action Point 2.2 (p.71) The Ministry of Economy, Development and Tourism will: … Hold a working group meeting at least once each semester with the Division of Social Economy and Associativity and the Division of Smaller Business Enterprises, with the purpose of identifying the impact of human rights in the management of businesses such as cooperatives and SMEs, and of incorporating the vision of human rights and business enterprises within this type of economic associations. Based on the activities of the working groups, sector guides will be developed to evaluate compliance with human rights issues, with special emphasis on the management of supply chains. … Subscribe in 2017 an agreement with a technical specialised body to develop a system to diagnose and measure the impact of small and medium size enterprises on human rights, through a digital tool of public access.

The state duty to protect human rights 2.3 Actions taken Danish Government’s expectations to companies [page 11] “… at Danish embassies in emerging markets, the Trade Council in co-operation with the Danish Business Authority holds workshops in responsible supply chain management, especially focusing on small and mediumsized companies and their local business partners (GP 3c). The courses are held on an annual basis. They include practical guidance on how to demonstrate due diligence in business operations in regard to adverse impacts on human rights. To further assist Danish companies in emerging markets, the embassies are also conducting CSR reviews of local business partners. The reviews include a due diligence component (UNGPs 3c).” Providing effective guidance on how to respect human rights [page 14] “The Danish Government is committed to continuously improving and promoting guidance provided to companies on how to work with CSR in general and human rights in particular. To ensure that companies have the right tools and the necessary guidance to handle the new due diligence requirements, the Government has updated the existing web tool, the CSR Compass and the Global Compact Self-Assessment Tool in accordance with the due diligence requirements of the UNGPs. The revised Compass includes a guide for small and medium-sized companies on how to exercise due diligence (GP 17) and also gives guidance on ways to solve company conflicts by actively engaging in a dialogue with the company’s stakeholders (GP 29).” 3. The corporate responsibility to respect human rights 3.3 Actions taken Award for best non-financial report [page 18] In the section: Award for best non-financial report, the NAP states [page 18]: “The Danish trade organisation of auditing, accounting, tax and corporate finance, “FSR – Danish Auditors” annually announces the company with the best CSR report both for large companies and SMEs.

Not only does this allow them to meet their obligations, it is also a key factor in their long-term viability and the image they project to investors and the public. To help companies, especially SMEs, manage this logistically and financially challenging process, a wide range of tools and support is available from actors in the public and private sectors. Most of these resources are free, publicly available and adaptable to business requirements. … 2.

Federal Government expectations regarding corporate due diligence in respecting human rights [page 8-13] Scope and practical structuring of due diligence in the field of human rights “The responsibility to exercise due diligence applies in principle to all enterprises, regardless of their size, the sector in which they operate, or their operational context within a supply or value chain with an international dimension. … Depending on the size of the enterprise, the nature of its products or services, the potential risk of particularly adverse impacts on human rights and the operating context, the measures to be taken are likely to vary in scope. It may be appropriate to conduct certain elements of the process in combination with other enterprises within an association or industry, subject to compliance with antitrust legislation. Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular should make use of the advisory and support services to be offered by the Federal Government and business associations under the National Action Plan.” Procedure for the identification of actual and potential adverse impacts on human rights “The size of an enterprise, the sector to which it belongs and the nature of its business activity directly influence the risk that its operations will have an impact on human rights. The required depth and breadth of the risk assessment depends on these factors.” Reporting “…At the same time, such reporting obligations should not impose disproportionate administrative burdens on the reporting companies or on the SMEs in their supply chains.” Measures “The Federal Government expects all enterprises to introduce the processes described above in a manner commensurate with their size, the sector in which they operate and their position in supply and value chains. Their compliance will be reviewed annually from 2018. In the absence of adequate compliance, the Federal Government will consider further action, which may culminate in legislative measures and in a widening of the circle of enterprises to be reviewed (see chapter VI below).” IV. Key areas for action [page 13] “It emerged from the process of dialogue and consultation on this Action Plan that the extent to which measures to be adopted to advance the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles would have to be binding would vary between these key areas. In addition to these measures, incentives and support services are to be created which would enable all participants, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to implement the Guiding Principles successfully.” 2.1 Ensuring the protection of human rights in supply and value chains The current situation [page 28-29] “the G7 are to: … in particular, assist small and medium-sized enterprises in developing a common understanding of due diligence and responsible supply-chain management.” 2.2 Transparency and communication regarding corporate impacts on human rights The current situation [page 31] “… Sponsored by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the Institute for Ecological Economy Research (IÖW) assesses the quality of sustainability reports from large enterprises and SMEs and draws up a league table for each of these categories. This ranking is intended to stimulate corporate competition in the realm of sustainability reporting and to highlight and propagate benchmarks for high-quality reporting.” 2.3 Business activity in conflict zones Measures [page 33] “The Federal Government is pursuing the aim of preventing the use of proceeds from the sale of tin, tantalum and tungsten, of their respective ores and of gold to fund armed struggles in conflict zones and other high-risk areas. It is committed to the establishment of binding due diligence rules, which should be proportionate and should not entail unnecessary red tape, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.” 3. Available means of practical implementation support [page 33-36] The Federal Government would like to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in particular in fulfilling the extensive corporate due-diligence requirements and expectations relating to human rights (see chapter III above). The current situation Numerous measures and services are already available for this purpose. A selection of existing and planned measures is described in some detail below: … The National CSR Forum, which was launched by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in 2009, consists of currently 41 members – high-ranking experts from business, trade unions, non-governmental organisations and research bodies as well as representatives of the participating federal ministries. Among the main tasks of the National CSR Forum are the provision of advice to the Federal Government on the continuing development of the national CSR strategy and the formulation of recommendations on specific issues. In 2010, the National CSR Forum, with the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in the lead role, discussed and developed a National CSR Action Plan. The measures and activities that have been carried out in the framework of the Action Plan have reached numerous enterprises. In a decision taken on 30 August 2012, the National CSR Forum expressed its support for “a smart mix of voluntary policy measures and, where necessary, complementary regulation” (2012, p. 11). Through the ESF promotion scheme for “social responsibility in SMEs”, more than 3,000 SMEs received advice and training in social responsibility, and regional CSR networks have been made permanent. Numerous specialised events have been staged in the framework of the CSR Forum to advise enterprises on the exercise of due diligence. … The Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development makes information and guidance available to enterprises of various sizes from various sectors, particularly by funding the work of the German Global Compact Network. Ever since 2004, the Ministry has been promoting the Network in close consultation with the Federal Foreign Office. The Network unites the German signatories of the UN Global Compact, whose core principles include respect for fundamental human rights and labour standards. As a business-driven multi-stakeholder forum, the Network has been providing training courses for management staff in the exercise of corporate responsibility for human rights ever since 2008. Measures III. Opportunities for training and dialogue In cooperation with business networks, ‘practice days’ for SMEs are offered nationwide. These sessions provide support, information and exchanges with other enterprises on responsible supply chain management and high-quality sustainability reporting.” Read more about Germany Ireland Section 1: International Context and Domestic Consultative Process The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights – Protect, Respect & Remedy [page 8] The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights “are intended to apply to all business enterprises, both transnational and local, regardless of size, sector, location and ownership or structure.” Section 3: Actions II.

Because SMEs include a wide range of companies in terms of size, sector, and business category, the Government will implement business and human rights efforts with input from the SMEs that reflects the diversity of these enterprises. The Government also recognizes the need to engage in awareness-raising activities to increase understanding and implementation by SMEs, while also being considerate of SMEs’ position in business transactions. (Future measures planned) (a) Provide information to SMEs through the portal site on business and human rights Set up a portal site with centralized information related to business and human rights to promote efforts regarding business and human rights made by SMEs.

Read more about South Korea Spain I. Commitment to implement the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights Many companies in our country have already incorporated this responsibility in the field of human rights into their business strategy. Others, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, will find in this Action Plan the adequate tools to address this responsibility to respect human rights in the development of their operations. Guiding Principle 2 The State expects from Spanish companies, in Spain and abroad, a behavior consistent with its responsibility to respect human rights, which implies that they must act with due diligence, depending on their size and circumstances, to avoid the violation of the rights of third parties and to deal with the adverse impacts of their activity. Measure 8 The Monitoring Commission will design and submit to the Government the adoption of an incentive system that includes both large companies and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that carry out policies in the field of human rights. These incentives may be economic, commercial, visibility and image, or other nature, to encourage companies to have policies and reliably certify that they have implemented adequate procedures at a global level according to their size and circumstances, namely: A public commitment to assume its responsibility to respect human rights in accordance with the provisions of the Principle no. 16; A process of due diligence aligned with the sectorial guides regarding the OECD (due diligence guidance), and based on the dialogue with stakeholders that allows identification, prevention, mitigation, and accountability of how they address the impact of their own activities and those that are directly related to their business relationships in accordance with the provisions of Principles no. 17 to no. 21; Some processes that allow to remedy all the negative consequences on human rights that have caused or contributed to provoke according to what is established in Principles no. 22, no.29, no. 30, no. 31. Guiding Principle 3 Measure 6 “In accordance with the recommendations of the EU, the Government will promote information and training of SMEs and social economy entities, through all available means in business associations, and will promote the creation of sectorial forums of learning in order to discuss good practices and to reach commitments of interest for each sector.” Guiding Principle 6 Measure 2 “The Government will ensure strict respect for human rights by companies in commercial transactions with other companies, establishing the necessary measures so as to: not discriminate against SMEs; respect the provisions of the Treaty of the EU on non-discrimination; equal treatment and transparency: and no administrative charges are to be added to contracting authorities or companies.” Read more about Spain Sweden 2 The corporate responsibility to respect human rights [page 13] “The conditions for companies’ efforts to respect human rights vary depending on their size … In keeping with the UN Guiding Principles, businesses’ human rights efforts are expected to include the following main points: … Procedure: … Establish an integrated and ongoing process in the company to identify, prevent and manage human rights risks and opportunities, as appropriate to the size, nature and context of the operations, i.e. due diligence” Annex: Measures planned [page 28-29] How can the State support the business sector? “Central government will enhance its collaboration with the regional CSR networks in Sweden and take particular steps to strengthen the dialogue with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).” Trade promotion “Business Sweden (the Swedish Trade & Invest Council) will be instructed to strengthen its implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and, in particular, to support small and medium-sized enterprises in this area.” Annex: Links [page 30] “The European Commission has produced a guide to human rights for small and mediumsized enterprises in Swedish, based on the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights.

These are available on the Commission website: www.ec.europa.eu” Read more about Sweden Switzerland 2 National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights 2020-23 2.2 Pillar 2: the corporate responsibility to respect human rights 2.2.1 Foundational principles Guiding Principles 11 to 15 SMEs [Small and medium enterprises] are particularly important in Switzerland because they are a major part of the country’s economic fabric. Given their limited human resources and expertise on human rights, the management of potential human rights risks can pose a significant challenge for SMEs. Despite their good practices, they generally lack systemic responses to human rights-related issues. The concepts developed by international bodies like the OECD and UN must be presented in a way that takes into account the limited resources available to SMEs and the business environment in which they operate. SMEs are therefore encouraged to use the support measures provided by the federal government and umbrella associations. Measure 24: Support for industry initiatives The federal government will step up cooperation with industry initiatives, associations and chambers of commerce which promote the UN Guiding Principles, and support action taken by businesses to uphold human rights.48 This will involve identifying initiatives and actors which have the potential to substantially further the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles by businesses. Priority will be given to initiatives that contribute to due diligence training for business enterprises or that are developing practical and effective human rights tools for SMEs. All tools developed as part of initiatives supported and recognised under the NAP will be made available to the businesses online. Measure 26: Promotion of best practices The federal government intends to hold a Swiss Business and Human Rights Forum as part of its efforts to encourage and promote human rights best practices among businesses. The forum will provide stakeholders with a platform to discuss trends and challenges in implementing the UN Guiding Principles and foster dialogue and cooperation, particularly on the operational challenges faced by certain sectors. The forum will also help identify best practices for SMEs. Measure 29: Public-private partnerships to promote respect for human rights in the value chain To promote the implementation of labour rights and human rights by business enterprises, the federal government, together with the ILO, supports the Better Work programme for the textile industry and the Sustaining Competitive and Responsible Enterprises (SCORE) programme to support SMEs in creating decent working conditions. These projects are jointly run by the ILO, governments, the private sector and unions, and are focused on compliance with fundamental labour standards, including measures to combat child and forced labour. The tools developed by these programmes are shared with the private sector Measure 30: Guides and tools to implement the UN Guiding Principles Federal government will explore the possibility of translating some of these into the national languages to enable them to be adapted and implemented in Switzerland. The complex nature of these guides means that some companies, especially SMEs, may find it difficult to put them into practice. Easy-to-use online interactive tools could provide a starting point for SMEs. The Swiss government will develop instruments that enable SMEs to carry out risk assessments and identify measures. They also could provide the basis for an assessment of the action needed to improve human rights due diligence. Read more about Switzerland Thailand 3.

Every third year the World Water Council organizes the World Water Forum in close collaboration with the authorities of the hosting country. The Forum is the largest international event in the field of water. The 6th World Water Forum took place in Marseille, France, in 2012 and the 7th World Water Forum in Daegu-Gyeongbuk, Republic of Korea, in April 2015. The 8th World Water Forum took place in Brasilia, Brazil, from 18 to 23 March 2018 under the overarching theme 'Sharing Water'. The 9th World Water Forum will be held in Dakar, Senegal, in March 2021. The World Water Council is financed primarily through membership fees, and additional support is provided by the host City of Marseille. Specific projects and programs are financed through donations and grants from governments, international organizations, and NGOs.

"Initiatives | World Water Council EnglishFrenchChineseSpanishRussian User account menu Log in Main navigation About us Initiatives World Water Forum Members Publications News Events Press Search Open Overlay Initiatives The World Water Council works on a number of areas that harness the expertise and experience of our members. We seek to increase the visibility, impact, and influence of these issues among key stakeholders to advance the course of the critical water-related challenges of our times. 2019 marked the start of a new triennial strategy and streamlined a new set of programs. The World Water Council’s Task Forces, and its wider membership, have gone into action  focusing on Water Security, Water Financing, Global Changes, and IWRM and Transversality. In addition to the World Water Council's main initiatives, members are also encouraged to propose work on new and emerging issues. Financing Water The financing world is no longer lacking in innovation for the water sector. In recent years, the challenge of financing water infrastructure has been met with new thinking around blended finance and hybridity. Link to Water Financing webpage Water Security The concept of water security captures a broad concept: the availability of an adequate quantity and quality of water to sustain socioeconomic development, livelihoods, health and ecosystems, everywhere. In other words, water security is fundamental to development. Given its central importance, it is also a priority in the Council’s strategy. Link to Water Security webpage Global Changes The Global Changes program is a response to  large-scale forces reshaping the world of water and affecting water resources globally. Link to Global Changes webpage Water and climate change With key partners in the sector, the Council focuses on elevating the role of water in adapting to climate change and increasing resilience at all levels. Link to Water and climate change webpage IWRM and Transversality Governance is perhaps the most important factor for a world seeking to overcome a host of interconnected water threats and changes. In recognition of this, the Council is refining concepts around integrated water resource management (IWRM) and water governance as a resource connecting every domain of sustainable development. Link to IWRM and Transversality webpage Involving key political actors To strengthen and deepen political engagement, the Council works with governments, parliamentarians and partners to increase the visibility of water on the agenda of key multilateral political forums. Link to Involving key political actors webpage Cities at the heart of growth The Council works to enhance water security in cities by helping local and regional authorities to prioritize the role of water for sustainable urban development and planning.

Marseille (/mɑːrˈseɪ/ mar-SAY, also spelled in English as Marseilles; French: [maʁsɛj] (listen), locally [maχˈsɛjə] (listen); Occitan: Marselha [maʀˈsejɔ, -ˈsijɔ]) is the prefecture of the Bouches-du-Rhône department and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in France. Situated in the Provence historical province, it is located on the coast of the Gulf of Lion, part of the Mediterranean Sea, near the mouth of the Rhône. Marseille is the second-largest city in France, covering an area of 241 km2 (93 sq mi); it had a population of 870,018 in 2016.[4] Its metropolitan area, which extends over 3,174 km2 (1,225 sq mi), is the third-largest in France after those of Paris and Lyon, with a population of 1,760,653 as of 2017,[3] or 3,100,329 (2019) by the broader Eurostat definition of metropolitan region.[5] Its inhabitants are called Marseillais. Founded around 600 BC by Greek settlers from Phocaea, Marseille is the oldest city of France, as well as one of Europe's oldest continuously inhabited settlements.[6][7] It was known to the ancient Greeks as Massalia (Greek: Μασσαλία, romanized: Massalía) and to Romans as Massilia.[6][8] Marseille has been a trading port since ancient times. In particular, it experienced a considerable commercial boom during the colonial period and especially during the 19th century, becoming a prosperous industrial and trading city. Nowadays the Old Port still lies at the heart of the city where the manufacturing of soap, its famous savon de Marseille, began some 6 centuries ago. Overlooking the port is the Basilica of Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde or ""Bonne-mère"" for the people of Marseille, a Romano-Byzantine church and the symbol of the city. Inherited from this past, the Grand Port Maritime de Marseille (GPMM) and the maritime economy are major poles of regional and national activity and Marseille remains the first French port, the second Mediterranean port and the fifth European port.[9] Since its origins, Marseille's openness to the Mediterranean Sea has made it a cosmopolitan city marked by cultural and economic exchanges with Southern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and Asia. In Europe, the city has the third largest Jewish community after London and Paris.[10] In the 1990s, the Euroméditerranée project for economic development and urban renewal was launched. New infrastructures and renovations were carried out in the 2000s and 2010s: the tramway, the renovation of the Hôtel-Dieu into a luxury hotel, the expansion of the Velodrome Stadium, the CMA CGM Tower, as well as other quayside museums such as the Museum of Civilisations of Europe and the Mediterranean (MuCEM). As a result, Marseille now has the most museums in France after Paris. The city was named European Capital of Culture in 2013 and European Capital of Sport in 2017. Additionally, Marseille hosted matches at the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2016. It is also home to several higher education institutions in the region, including the University of Aix-Marseille.

To the east, starting in the small fishing village of Callelongue on the outskirts of Marseille and stretching as far as Cassis, are the Calanques, a rugged coastal area interspersed with small fjord-like inlets. Farther east still are the Sainte-Baume (a 1,147 m (3,763 ft) mountain ridge rising from a forest of deciduous trees), the city of Toulon and the French Riviera. To the north of Marseille, beyond the low Garlaban and Etoile mountain ranges, is the 1,011 m (3,317 ft) Mont Sainte Victoire. To the west of Marseille is the former artists' colony of l'Estaque; farther west are the Côte Bleue, the Gulf of Lion and the Camargue region in the Rhône delta. The airport lies to the north west of the city at Marignane on the Étang de Berre.[11] The city's main thoroughfare (the wide boulevard called the Canebière) stretches eastward from the Old Port to the Réformés quarter. Two large forts flank the entrance to the Old Port—Fort Saint-Nicolas[a][12] on the south side and Fort Saint-Jean on the north. Farther out in the Bay of Marseille is the Frioul archipelago which comprises four islands, one of which, If, is the location of Château d'If, made famous by the Dumas novel The Count of Monte Cristo. The main commercial centre of the city intersects with the Canebière at Rue St Ferréol and the Centre Bourse (one of the city's main shopping malls). The centre of Marseille has several pedestrianised zones, most notably Rue St Ferréol, Cours Julien near the Music Conservatory, the Cours Honoré-d'Estienne-d'Orves off the Old Port and the area around the Hôtel de Ville. To the south east of central Marseille in the 6th arrondissement are the Prefecture and the monumental fountain of Place Castellane, an important bus and metro interchange. To the south west are the hills of the 7th and 8th arrondissements, dominated by the basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde. Marseille's main railway station—Gare de Marseille Saint-Charles—is north of the Centre Bourse in the 1st arrondissement; it is linked by the Boulevard d'Athènes to the Canebière.[11] History[edit] Main articles: History of Marseille and Timeline of Marseille Marseille and Calanques National Park from the ISS, February 2017 Notre-Dame de la Garde from above, July 2020 A silver drachma inscribed with MASSA[LIA] (ΜΑΣΣΑ[ΛΙΑ]), dated 375–200 BC, during the Hellenistic period of Marseille, bearing the head of the Greek goddess Artemis on the obverse and a lion on the reverse Marseille was founded as the Greek colony of Massalia circa 600 BC, and was populated by Greek settlers from Phocaea (modern Foça, Turkey). It became the preeminent Greek polis in the Hellenized region of southern Gaul.[13] The city-state sided with the Roman Republic against Carthage during the Second Punic War (218–201 BC), retaining its independence and commercial empire throughout the western Mediterranean even as Rome expanded into Western Europe and North Africa. However, the city lost its independence following the Roman Siege of Massilia in 49 BC, during Caesar's Civil War, in which Massalia sided with the exiled faction at war with Julius Caesar. Afterward the Gallo-Roman culture was initiated. Marseille continued to prosper as a Gallo-Roman city, becoming an early center of Christianity during the Western Roman Empire.[citation needed] The city maintained its position as a premier maritime trading hub even after its capture by the Visigoths in the 5th century AD, although the city went into decline following the sack of 739 AD by the forces of Charles Martel. It became part of the County of Provence during the 10th century, although its renewed prosperity was curtailed by the Black Death of the 14th century and a sack of the city by the Crown of Aragon in 1423. The city's fortunes rebounded with the ambitious building projects of René of Anjou, Count of Provence, who strengthened the city's fortifications during the mid-15th century. During the 16th century the city hosted a naval fleet with the combined forces of the Franco-Ottoman alliance, which threatened the ports and navies of the Genoese Republic.[14] Marseille lost a significant portion of its population during the Great Plague of Marseille in 1720, but the population had recovered by mid-century. In 1792, the city became a focal point of the French Revolution and though France's national anthem was born in Strasbourg, it was first sung in Paris by volunteers from Marseille, hence the name the crowd gave it: La Marseillaise. The Industrial Revolution and establishment of the French Empire during the 19th century allowed for further expansion of the city, although it was occupied by the German Wehrmacht in November 1942 and subsequently heavily damaged during World War II. The city has since become a major center for immigrant communities from former French colonies, such as French Algeria. Economy[edit] Marseille is a major French centre for trade and industry, with excellent transportation infrastructure (roads, sea port and airport). Marseille Provence Airport is the fourth largest in France. In May 2005, the French financial magazine L'Expansion named Marseille the most dynamic of France's large cities, citing figures showing that 7,200 companies had been created in the city since 2000.[15] Marseille is also France's second largest research centre with 3,000 research scientists within Aix Marseille University.[citation needed] As of 2014[update], the Marseille metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $60.3 billion, or $36,127 per capita (purchasing power parity).[16] Port[edit] Main articles: Marseille-Fos Port, Old Port of Marseille, and Docks (Marseille) The entrance to the Old Port, flanked by Fort Saint-Jean and Fort Saint-Nicolas Historically, the economy of Marseille was dominated by its role as a port of the French Empire, linking the North African colonies of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia with Metropolitan France. The Old Port was replaced as the main port for trade by the Port de la Joliette (now part of Marseille-Fos Port) during the Second Empire and now contains restaurants, offices, bars and hotels and functions mostly as a private marina. The majority of the port and docks, which experienced decline in the 1970s after the oil crisis, have been recently redeveloped with funds from the European Union. Fishing remains important in Marseille and the food economy of Marseille is fed by the local catch; a daily fish market is still held on the Quai des Belges of the Old Port. The economy of Marseille and its region is still linked to its commercial port, the first French port and the fifth European port by cargo tonnage, which lies north of the Old Port and eastern in Fos-sur-Mer. Some 45,000 jobs are linked to the port activities and it represents 4 billion euros added value to the regional economy.[17] 100 million tons of freight pass annually through the port, 60% of which is petroleum, making it number one in France and the Mediterranean and number three in Europe. However, in the early 2000s, the growth in container traffic was being stifled by the constant strikes and social upheaval.[18] The port is among the 20th firsts in Europe for container traffic with 1,062,408 TEU and new infrastructures have already raised the capacity to 2M TEU.[19] Petroleum refining and shipbuilding are the principal industries, but chemicals, soap, glass, sugar, building materials, plastics, textiles, olive oil, and processed foods are also important products.[citation needed] Marseille is connected with the Rhône via a canal and thus has access to the extensive waterway network of France. Petroleum is shipped northward to the Paris basin by pipeline. The city also serves as France's leading centre of oil refining. Companies, services and high technologies[edit] From left to right: La Joliette neighbourhood (old docks), ferry ship docks, new port, Euroméditerranée business district (CMA CGM Tower) and surrounding areas In recent years, the city has also experienced a large growth in service sector employment and a switch from light manufacturing to a cultural, high-tech economy.[citation needed] The Marseille region is home to thousands of companies, 90% of which are small and medium enterprises with less than 500 employees.[20][full citation needed] Among the most famous ones are CMA CGM, container-shipping giant; Compagnie maritime d'expertises (Comex), world leader in sub-sea engineering and hydraulic systems; Airbus Helicopters, an Airbus division; Azur Promotel, an active real estate development company; La Provence, the local daily newspaper; RTM, Marseille's public transport company; and Société Nationale Maritime Corse Méditerranée (SNCM), a major operator in passenger, vehicle and freight transportation in the Western Mediterranean. The urban operation Euroméditerranée has developed a large offer of offices and thus Marseille hosts one of the main business district in France. Marseille is the home of three main technopoles: Château-Gombert (technological innovations), Luminy (biotechnology) and La Belle de Mai (17,000 sq.m. of offices dedicated to multimedia activities).[21][22] Tourism and attractions[edit] Pointe Rouge Beach Palais du Pharo The port is also an important arrival base for millions of people each year, with 2.4 million including 890,100 from cruise ships.[17] With its beaches, history, architecture and culture (24 museums and 42 theatres), Marseille is one of the most visited cities in France, with 4.1 million visitors in 2012.[23] Marseille is ranked 86th in the world for business tourism and events, advancing from the 150th spot one year before.[citation needed] The number of congress days hosted on its territory increased from 109,000 in 1996 to almost 300,000 in 2011.[citation needed] They take place in three main sites, the Palais du Pharo, Palais des Congrès et des Expositions (Parc Chanot) and World Trade Center.[24] In 2012 Marseille hosted the World Water Forum. Several urban projects have been developed to make Marseille attractive. Thus new parks, museums, public spaces and real estate projects aim to improve the city's quality of life (Parc du 26e Centenaire, Old Port of Marseille,[25] numerous places in Euroméditerranée) to attract firms and people. Marseille municipality acts to develop Marseille as a regional nexus for entertainment in the south of France with high concentration of museums, cinemas, theatres, clubs, bars, restaurants, fashion shops, hotels, and art galleries. Employment[edit] Unemployment in the economy fell from 20% in 1995 to 14% in 2004.[26] However, Marseille unemployment rate remains higher than the national average. In some parts of Marseille, youth unemployment is reported to be as high as 40%.[27] Administration[edit] Main articles: Arrondissements of Marseille and Cantons of Marseille The sectors and arrondissements of Marseille Political majority in each sector since 2014 The city of Marseille is divided into 16 municipal arrondissements, which are themselves informally divided into 111 neighbourhoods (French: quartiers). The arrondissements are regrouped in pairs, into 8 sectors, each with a mayor and council (like the arrondissements in Paris and Lyon).[28] Municipal elections are held every six years and are carried out by sector. There are 303 councilmembers in total, two-thirds sitting in the sector councils and one third in the city council. The 9th arrondissement of Marseille is the largest in terms of area because it comprises parts of Calanques National Park. With a population of 89,316 (2007), the 13th arrondissement of Marseille is the most populous one. From 1950 to the mid-1990s, Marseille was a Socialist (PS) and Communist (PCF) stronghold. Gaston Defferre (PS) was consecutively reelected six times as Mayor of Marseille from 1953 until his death in 1986. He was succeeded by Robert Vigouroux of the European Democratic and Social Rally (RDSE). Jean-Claude Gaudin of the conservative UMP was elected Mayor of Marseille in 1995. Gaudin was reelected in 2001, 2008 and 2014. In recent years, the Communist Party has lost most of its strength in the northern boroughs of the city, whereas the National Front has received significant support. At the last municipal election in 2014, Marseille was divided between the northern arrondissements dominated by the left (PS) and far-right (FN) and the southern part of town dominated by the conservative (UMP). Marseille is also divided in twelve cantons, each of them sending two members to the Departmental Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône department. Mayors of Marseille since the beginning of the 20th century[edit] Gaston Defferre served as Mayor of Marseille from 1953 to 1986. Jean-Claude Gaudin served as Mayor of Marseille from 1995 to 2020.

Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (June 2017) Because of its pre-eminence as a Mediterranean port, Marseille has always been one of the main gateways into France. This has attracted many immigrants and made Marseille a cosmopolitan melting pot. By the end of the 18th century about half the population originated from elsewhere in Provence mostly and also from southern France.[31][32][page needed] Economic conditions and political unrest in Europe and the rest of the world brought several other waves of immigrants during the 20th century: Greeks and Italians started arriving at the end of the 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century, up to 40% of the city's population was of Italian origin;[33] Russians in 1917; Armenians in 1915 and 1923; Vietnamese in the 1920s, 1954 and after 1975;[34] Corsicans during the 1920s and 1930s; Spanish after 1936; Maghrebis (both Arab and Berber) in the inter-war period; Sub-Saharan Africans after 1945; Maghrebi Jews in the 1950s and 1960s; the Pieds-Noirs from the former French Algeria in 1962; and then from Comoros. In 2006, it was reported that 70,000 city residents were considered to be of Maghrebi origin, mostly from Algeria. The second largest group in Marseille in terms of single nationalities were from the Comoros, amounting to some 45,000 people.[33] Currently, over one third of the population of Marseille can trace their roots back to Italy.[35] Marseille also has the second-largest Corsican and Armenian populations of France. Other significant communities include Maghrebis, Turks, Comorians, Chinese, and Vietnamese.[36] In 1999, in several arrondissements, about 40% of the young people under 18 were of Maghrebi origin (at least one immigrant parent).[37] Since 2013 a significant number of Central- and Eastern European immigrants have settled in Marseille, attracted by better job opportunities and the good climate of this Mediterranean city. The main nationalities of the immigrants are Romanians and Poles.[38] Largest groups of foreign residents Nationality Population (2014)[39] Algeria 41,987 Tunisia 10,918 Morocco 8,411 Comoros 7,889 Italy 4,927 Turkey 4,497 Spain 2,717 Portugal 2,382 Romania 2,308 Senegal 2,150 Madagascar 1,869 Vietnam 1,606 Russia 1,359 China[b] 1,200 Lebanon 1,155 Place of birth of residents of the city proper of Marseille in 1999 Born in Metropolitan France Born outside Metropolitan France 78.9% 21.1% Born inOverseas France Born in foreign countries with French citizenship at birth1 EU-15 immigrants2 Non-EU-15 immigrants 0.9% 8.8% 2.1% 9.3% Place of birth of residents of the metropolitan area of Marseille in 1999 Born in metropolitan France Born outside metropolitan France 81.2% 18.8% Born inoverseas France Born in foreign countries with French citizenship at birth1 EU-15 immigrants2 Non-EU-15 immigrants 0.7% N/A% N/A% N/A% 1 This group is made up largely of former French settlers, such as Pieds-Noirs in Northwest Africa, followed by former colonial citizens who had French citizenship at birth (such as was often the case for the native elite in French colonies), as well as to a lesser extent foreign-born children of French expatriates. Note that a foreign country is understood as a country not part of France in 1999, so a person born for example in 1950 in Algeria, when Algeria was an integral part of France, is nonetheless listed as a person born in a foreign country in French statistics. 2 An immigrant is a person born in a foreign country not having French citizenship at birth. Note that an immigrant may have acquired French citizenship since moving to France, but is still considered an immigrant in French statistics. On the other hand, persons born in France with foreign citizenship (the children of immigrants) are not listed as immigrants. Religion[edit] According to data from 2010, major religious communities in Marseille include: Roman Catholic (415,000 or 38.5%)[40] Muslim (264,000 or 25%) Non-religious (156.000 or 14.5%) Armenian Apostolic (80,000 or 7.5%) Protestant (mostly Pentecostal) (75,000 or 7.1%) Jewish (52,000 or 4.9%) Eastern Orthodox (15,000 or 1.4%) Hindu (4,000 or 0.4%) Buddhist (3,000 or 0.3%).[41] Culture[edit] Paul Cézanne's The Bay of Marseille, Seen from L'Estaque Bastille Day military parade in Marseille, 2012 Marseille is a city that has its own unique culture and is proud of its differences from the rest of France.[42] Today it is a regional centre for culture and entertainment with an important opera house, historical and maritime museums, five art galleries and numerous cinemas, clubs, bars and restaurants. Marseille has a large number of theatres, including La Criée, Le Gymnase and the Théâtre Toursky. There is also an extensive arts centre in La Friche, a former match factory behind the Saint-Charles station. The Alcazar, until the 1960s a well known music hall and variety theatre, has recently been completely remodelled behind its original façade and now houses the central municipal library.[43] Other music venues in Marseille include Le Silo (also a theatre) and GRIM. Marseille has also been important in the arts. It has been the birthplace and home of many French writers and poets, including Victor Gélu [fr], Valère Bernard, Pierre Bertas,[44] Edmond Rostand and André Roussin. The small port of l'Estaque on the far end of the Bay of Marseille became a favourite haunt for artists, including Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne (who frequently visited from his home in Aix), Georges Braque and Raoul Dufy. Multi-cultural influences[edit] Rich and poor neighborhoods exist side by side. Although the city is not without crime, Marseille has a larger degree of multicultural tolerance. Urban geographers[45] say the city's geography, being surrounded by mountains, helps explain why Marseille does not have the same problems as Paris. In Paris, ethnic areas are segregated and concentrated in the periphery of the city. Residents of Marseille are of diverse origins, yet appear to share a similar particular identity.[46][47] An example is how Marseille responded in 2005, when ethnic populations living in other French cities' suburbs rioted, but Marseille remained relatively calm.[48] Marseille served as the European Capital of Culture for 2013 along with Košice.[49] It was chosen to give a 'human face' to the European Union to celebrate cultural diversity and to increase understanding between Europeans.[50] One of the intentions of highlighting culture is to help reposition Marseille internationally, stimulate the economy, and help to build better interconnection between groups.[51] Marseille-Provence 2013 (MP2013) featured more than 900 cultural events held throughout Marseille and the surrounding communities. These cultural events generated more than 11 million visits.[52] The European Capital of Culture was also the occasion to unveil more than 600 million euros in new cultural infrastructure in Marseille and its environs, including the MuCEM designed by Rudy Ricciotti. Early on, immigrants came to Marseille locally from the surrounding Provence region. By the 1890s immigrants came from other regions of France as well as Italy.[53] Marseille became one of Europe's busiest port by 1900.[47] Marseille has served as a major port where immigrants from around the Mediterranean arrive.[53] Marseille continued to be multicultural. Armenians from the Ottoman Empire began arriving in 1913. In the 1930s, Italians settled in Marseille. After World War II, a wave of Jewish immigrants from North Africa arrived. In 1962, a number of French colonies gained their independence, and the French citizens from Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia arrived in Marseille.[54] The city had an economic downturn and lost many jobs. Those who could afford to move left and the poorest remained. For a while, the mafia appeared to run the city, and for a period of time the communist party was prominent.[54] Multi-cultural Marseille can be observed by a visitor at the market at Noailles, also called Marché des Capucins, in old town near the Old Port. There, Lebanese bakeries, an African spice market, Chinese and Vietnamese groceries, fresh vegetables and fruit, shops selling couscous, shops selling Caribbean food are side by side with stalls selling shoes and clothing from around the Mediterranean. Nearby, people sell fresh fish and men from Tunisia drink tea.[54] Although most Armenians arrived after the Armenian Genocide, Armenians had a long presence even before the 20th and late 19th centuries. Armenians, having an extensive trade network worldwide, massively traded with Marseille and its port. Most notably, during the 16th century, and after the Armenians gained a monopoly over Iranian silk, which was granted to them by Shah Abbas of Iran, the trade flow of Armenians of Marseille increased tremendously.[55] Merchants of Armenian origin received trade privileges in France by Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu (1585–1642) and later on Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619–1683) Marseille a free port in 1669. One notable Armenian-Iranian merchant gained a patent from Louis XIV (1638–1715) over Iranian silk.[56] Armenians also became successful money-lenders and bankers in the city. Due to these policies and the multiculturalism of the city of Marseille, Armenians became very wealthy, and the legacy of the Armenians in the city still lives on. Tarot de Marseille[edit] Marseille tarot card The most commonly used tarot deck takes its name from the city; it has been called the Tarot de Marseille since the 1930s—a name coined for commercial use by the French cardmaker and cartomancer Paul Marteau, owner of B–P Grimaud. Previously this deck was called Tarot italien (Italian Tarot) and even earlier it was simply called Tarot. Before being de Marseille, it was used to play the local variant of tarocchi before it became used in cartomancy at the end of the 18th century, following the trend set by Antoine Court de Gébelin. The name Tarot de Marseille (Marteau used the name ancien Tarot de Marseille) was used by contrast to other types of Tarots such as Tarot de Besançon; those names were simply associated with cities where there were many cardmakers in the 18th century (previously several cities in France were involved in cardmaking).[57] Another local tradition is the making of santons, small hand-crafted figurines for the traditional Provençal Christmas creche. Since 1803, starting on the last Sunday of November, there has been a Santon Fair in Marseille; it is currently held in the Cours d'Estienne d'Orves, a large square off the Vieux-Port. Opera[edit] The Opéra de Marseille Marseille's main cultural attraction was, since its creation at the end of the 18th century and until the late 1970s, the Opéra. Located near the Old Port and the Canebière, at the very heart of the city, its architectural style was comparable to the classical trend found in other opera houses built at the same time in Lyon and Bordeaux. In 1919, a fire almost completely destroyed the house, leaving only the stone colonnade and peristyle from the original façade.[58][59] The classical façade was restored and the opera house reconstructed in a predominantly Art Deco style, as the result of a major competition. Currently the Opéra de Marseille stages six or seven operas each year.[60] Since 1972, the Ballet national de Marseille has performed at the opera house; its director from its foundation to 1998 was Roland Petit. Popular events and festivals[edit] There are several popular festivals in different neighborhoods, with concerts, animations, and outdoor bars, like the Fête du Panier in June. On 21 June, there are dozens of free concerts in the city as part of France's Fête de la Musique, featuring music from all over the world. Being free events, many Marseille residents attend. Marseille hosts a Gay Pride event in early July. In 2013, Marseille hosted Europride, an international LGBT event, 10 July–20.[61] At the beginning of July, there is the International Documentary Festival.[62] At the end of September, the electronic music festival Marsatac takes place. In October, the Fiesta des Suds offers many concerts of world music.[63] Hip hop music[edit] Marseille is also well known in France for its hip hop music.[64] Bands like IAM originated from Marseille. Other known groups include Fonky Family, Psy 4 de la Rime (including rappers Soprano and Alonzo), and Keny Arkana. In a slightly different way, ragga music is represented by Massilia Sound System. Food[edit] Traditional Marseille bouillabaisse Swordfish in olive oil with ratatouille and saffron rice Pieds paquets Bouillabaisse is the most famous seafood dish of Marseille. It is a fish stew containing at least three varieties of very fresh local fish: typically red rascasse (Scorpaena scrofa); sea robin (fr: grondin); and European conger (fr: congre).[65] It can include gilt-head bream (fr: dorade); turbot; monkfish (fr: lotte or baudroie); mullet; or silver hake (fr: merlan), and it usually includes shellfish and other seafood such as sea urchins (fr: oursins), mussels (fr: moules); velvet crabs (fr: étrilles); spider crab (fr: araignées de mer), plus potatoes and vegetables. In the traditional version, the fish is served on a platter separate from the broth.[66] The broth is served with rouille, a mayonnaise made with egg yolk, olive oil, red bell pepper, saffron, and garlic, spread on pieces of toasted bread, or croûtons.[67][68] In Marseille, bouillabaisse is rarely made for fewer than ten people; the more people who share the meal, and the more different fish that are included, the better the bouillabaisse.[69] Aïoli is a sauce made from raw garlic, lemon juice, eggs and olive oil, served with boiled fish, hard boiled eggs and cooked vegetables.[67] Anchoïade [fr] is a paste made from anchovies, garlic, and olive oil, spread on bread or served with raw vegetables.[67] Bourride is a soup made with white fish (monkfish, European sea bass, whiting, etc.) and aïoli.[70] Fougasse is a flat Provençal bread, similar to the Italian focaccia. It is traditionally baked in a wood oven and sometimes filled with olives, cheese or anchovies.[citation needed] Navette de Marseille [fr] are, in the words of food writer M. F. K. Fisher, ""little boat-shaped cookies, tough dough tasting vaguely of orange peel, smelling better than they are.""[71] Farinata#French variations is chickpea flour boiled into a thick mush, allowed to firm up, then cut into blocks and fried.[72] Pastis is an alcoholic beverage made with aniseed and spice. It is extremely popular in the region.[73] Pieds paquets is a dish prepared from sheep's feet and offal.[70] Pistou is a combination of crushed fresh basil and garlic with olive oil, similar to the Italian pesto. The ""soupe au pistou"" combines pistou in a broth with pasta and vegetables.[67] Tapenade is a paste made from chopped olives, capers, and olive oil (sometimes anchovies may be added).[74] Films set in Marseille[edit] Main article: List of films set in Marseille Marseille has been the setting for many films. Main sights[edit] Marseille is listed as a major centre of art and history. The city has many museums and galleries and there are many ancient buildings and churches of historical interest.

Marseille is also home to the headquarters of the IRD, which promotes research into questions affecting developing countries.[citation needed] Transport[edit] Motorways around Marseille International and regional transport[edit] Marseille Provence Airport, the fifth busiest in France. The city is served by an international airport, Marseille Provence Airport, located in Marignane. The airport is the fifth busiest French airport, and known the 4th most important European traffic growth in 2012.[93] An extensive network of motorways connects Marseille to the north and west (A7), Aix-en-Provence in the north (A51), Toulon (A50) and the French Riviera (A8) to the east. Gare de Marseille Saint-Charles is Marseille's main railway station. It operates direct regional services to Aix-en-Provence, Briançon, Toulon, Avignon, Nice, Montpellier, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Nantes, etc. Gare Saint-Charles is also one of the main terminal stations for the TGV in the south of France making Marseille reachable in three hours from Paris (a distance of over 750 km) and just over one and a half hours from Lyon. There are also direct TGV lines to Lille, Brussels, Nantes, Geneva, Strasbourg and Frankfurt as well as Eurostar services to London (just in the summer) and Thello services to Milan (just one a day), via Nice and Genoa. There is a new long-distance bus station adjacent to new modern extension to the Gare Saint-Charles with destinations mostly to other Bouches-du-Rhône towns, including buses to Aix-en-Provence, Cassis, La Ciotat and Aubagne. The city is also served with 11 other regional trains stations in the east and the north of the city. Marseille has a large ferry terminal, the Gare Maritime, with services to Corsica, Sardinia, Algeria and Tunisia. Public transport[edit] See also: Transportation in Marseille Metro and tramway network Marseille is connected by the Marseille Métro train system operated by the Régie des transports de Marseille (RTM). It consists of two lines: Line 1 (blue) between Castellane and La Rose opened in 1977 and Line 2 (red) between Sainte-Marguerite-Dromel and Bougainville opened between 1984 and 1987. An extension of the Line 1 from Castellane to La Timone was completed in 1992, another extension from La Timone to La Fourragère (2.5 km (1.6 mi) and 4 new stations) was opened in May 2010. The Métro system operates on a turnstile system, with tickets purchased at the nearby adjacent automated booths. Both lines of the Métro intersect at Gare Saint-Charles and Castellane. Three bus rapid transit lines are under construction to better connect the Métro to farther places (Castellane -> Luminy; Capitaine Gèze – La Cabucelle -> Vallon des Tuves; La Rose -> Château Gombert – Saint Jérome). The new tramway An extensive bus network serves the city and suburbs of Marseille, with 104 lines and 633 buses. The three lines of the tramway,[94] opened in 2007, go from the CMA CGM Tower towards Les Caillols. As in many other French cities, a bike-sharing service nicknamed ""Le vélo"", free for trips of less than half an hour, was introduced by the city council in 2007.[95] A free ferry service operates between the two opposite quays of the Old Port. From 2011 ferry shuttle services operate between the Old Port and Pointe Rouge; in spring 2013 it will also run to l'Estaque.[96] There are also ferry services and boat trips available from the Old Port to Frioul, the Calanques and Cassis.

Match Race France 2008 Sailing is a major sport in Marseille. The wind conditions allow regattas in the warm waters of the Mediterranean.[citation needed] Throughout most seasons of the year it can be windy while the sea remains smooth enough to allow sailing. Marseille has been the host of 8 (2010) Match Race France events which are part of the World Match Racing Tour. The event draws the world's best sailing teams to Marseille. The identical supplied boats (J Boats J-80 racing yachts) are raced two at a time in an on the water dogfight which tests the sailors and skippers to the limits of their physical abilities. Points accrued count towards the World Match Racing Tour and a place in the final event, with the overall winner taking the title ISAF World Match Racing Tour Champion. Match racing is an ideal sport for spectators in Marseille, as racing in close proximity to the shore provides excellent views. The city was also considered as a possible venue for 2007 America's Cup.[98] Marseille is also a place for other water sports such as windsurfing and powerboating. Marseille has three golf courses. The city has dozens of gyms and several public swimming pools. Running is also popular in many of Marseille's parks such as Le Pharo and Le Jardin Pierre Puget. An annual footrace is held between the city and neighbouring Cassis: the Marseille-Cassis Classique Internationale.[citation needed] Climate[edit] The city has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa) with cool-mild winters with moderate rainfall, because of the wet westerly winds, and hot, mostly dry summers, due to the dry winds blowing from the Sahara desert at that period.[99] December, January, and February are the coldest months, averaging temperatures of around 12 °C (54 °F) during the day and 4 °C (39 °F) at night. July and August are the hottest months, averaging temperatures of around 28–30 °C (82–86 °F) during the day and 19 °C (66 °F) at night in the Marignane airport (35 km (22 mi) from Marseille) but in the city near the sea the average high temperature is 27 °C (81 °F) in July.[100] Marseille is officially the sunniest major city in France with over 2,800 hours of sunshine while the average sunshine in the country is around 1,950 hours. It is also the driest major city with only 512 mm (20 in) of precipitation annually, especially thanks to the Mistral, a cold, dry wind originating in the Rhône Valley that occurs mostly in winter and spring and which generally brings clear skies and sunny weather to the region. Less frequent is the Sirocco, a hot, sand-bearing wind, coming from the Sahara Desert. Snowfalls are infrequent; over 50% of years do not experience a single snowfall.[citation needed] The hottest temperature was 40.6 °C (105.1 °F) on 26 July 1983 during a great heat wave, the lowest temperature was −16.8 °C (1.8 °F) on 13 February 1929 during a strong cold wave.[101] Climate data for Marseille-Marignane (Marseille Provence Airport), elevation: 36 m, 1981–2010 normals, extremes

"World Water Council .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform Welcome to the United Nations DESA Home SDGs HLPF States SIDS UN System Stakeholders Topics Partnerships Resources About Documents Input from World Water Council World Water Council The past two decades have witnessed unprecedented economic and social progress. Real incomes in low- and middle-income countries have doubled and poverty rates have halved. Two billion people have gained access to improved drinking water. Maternal mortality has dropped by nearly half, and the share of those who are malnourished has fallen by a third. Yet at the same time the number of people living in poverty has increased. This has been one of the greatest and most rapid transformations in human history; and water resources management has helped initiate much of this change. But these achievements have been accompanied by mounting pressure on our natural resources, especially water. Considering that water is key to all aspects of sustainable development--food security, health, poverty reduction, women’s empowerment, environmental protection, as well as sustaining economic growth in agriculture, industry, and energy generation, just to name a few--the World Water Council reached out to the 7th World Water Forum Implementation Roadmap Champions in order to provide strong inputs to the 2017 HLPF on behalf of the water community. The Roadmaps embody the strong determination of the global water community to implement collective actions on specific themes that move the global water agenda forward and continuously monitor progress. Together, they benefit from a strategic and comprehensive vision relative to various water related issues. The following contribution includes inputs provided by the following organizations: Programme Solidarité Eau (pS-Eau); AquaFed; International Water Association (IWA); Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); K-water; International Water Resources Association (IWRA); OECD Water Governance Initiative (WGI); International Network of Basin Organizations (INBO); United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); Women for Water Partnership (WfWP); International Network of Water Training Centers (INWTC).

Official logo of the French Republic France (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ), officially the French Republic (French: République française),[1] is a transcontinental country spanning Western Europe and several overseas regions and territories.[XIII] Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea; overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. France borders Belgium, Luxembourg, and Germany to the northeast, Switzerland, Monaco and Italy to the east, Andorra and Spain to the south, as well as the Netherlands, Suriname, and Brazil in the Americas. Its eighteen integral regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi) and over 67 million people (as of May 2021[update]).[12] France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban areas include Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Lille, and Nice. Including its overseas territories, France has twelve time zones, the most of any country. Inhabited since the Palaeolithic era, France was settled by Celtic tribes known as Gauls during the Iron Age. Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture that laid the foundation of the French language. The Germanic Franks arrived in 476 and formed the Kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia becoming the Kingdom of France in 987. In the High Middle Ages, France was a highly decentralized feudal kingdom, but among the most powerful states in Europe. A distinct French identity began to emerge in the 14th and 15th centuries during the Hundred Years' War. The French Renaissance saw a flowering of art and culture, disputes with rivals Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, and the establishment of global colonial empire, which by the 20th century would become the second largest in the world.[13] Severely weakened by the Thirty Years' War and religious civil wars of the 17th century, under Louis XIV France reemerged as the dominant cultural, political, and military power by the early 18th century.[14] The costly Seven Years' War and involvement in the American Revolution precipitated the French Revolution of 1789, which overthrew the absolute monarchy, replaced the Ancien Régime with one of the first modern republics, and saw the drafting of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating much of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars shaped the course of European and world history. The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured a tumultuous succession of governments until the founding of the French Third Republic in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War. Subsequent decades saw a period of optimism, cultural and scientific flourishing, and economic prosperity known as the Belle Époque. France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious, and among the Allied powers in World War II, but came under occupation by the Axis in 1940. Following liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War. The Fifth Republic, led by Charles de Gaulle, was formed in 1958 and remains to this day. Algeria and nearly all other French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with most retaining close economic and military connections with France. France retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science, and philosophy. It hosts the world's fifth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the leading tourist destination, receiving over 89 million foreign visitors in 2018.[15] France is a developed country with the world's seventh-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the ninth-largest by PPP; in terms of aggregate household wealth, it ranks fourth in the world.[16] France performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, and human development.[17][18] It remains a great power in global affairs,[19] being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state. France is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the Eurozone,[20] additionally a member of the Group of 7, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and La Francophonie.

The name of the Franks is related to the English word frank (""free""): the latter stems from the Old French franc (""free, noble, sincere""), ultimately from Medieval Latin francus (""free, exempt from service; freeman, Frank""), a generalization of the tribal name that emerged as a Late Latin borrowing of the reconstructed Frankish endonym *Frank.[22][23] It has been suggested that the meaning ""free"" was adopted because, after the conquest of Gaul, only Franks were free of taxation,[24] or more generally because they had the status of freemen in contrast to servants or slaves.[23] The etymology of *Frank is uncertain. It is traditionally derived from the Proto-Germanic word *frankōn, which translates as ""javelin"" or ""lance"" (the throwing axe of the Franks was known as the francisca),[25] although these weapons may have been named because of their use by the Franks, not the other way around.[23] In English, 'France' is pronounced /fræns/ FRANSS in American English and /frɑːns/ FRAHNSS or /fræns/ FRANSS in British English. The pronunciation with /ɑː/ is mostly confined to accents with the trap-bath split such as Received Pronunciation, though it can be also heard in some other dialects such as Cardiff English, in which /frɑːns/ is in free variation with /fræns/.[26][27] History Main article: History of France Prehistory (before the 6th century BC) Main article: Prehistory of France One of the Lascaux paintings: a horse – approximately 17,000 BC. Lascaux is famous for its ""exceptionally detailed depictions of humans and animals"".[28] The oldest traces of human life in what is now France date from approximately 1.8 million years ago.[29] Over the ensuing millennia, humans were confronted by a harsh and variable climate, marked by several glacial periods. Early hominids led a nomadic hunter-gatherer life.[29] France has a large number of decorated caves from the upper Palaeolithic era, including one of the most famous and best preserved, Lascaux[29] (approximately 18,000 BC). At the end of the last glacial period (10,000 BC), the climate became milder;[29] from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of Western Europe entered the Neolithic era and its inhabitants became sedentary. After strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia, metallurgy appeared at the end of the 3rd millennium, initially working gold, copper and bronze, as well as later iron.[30] France has numerous megalithic sites from the Neolithic period, including the exceptionally dense Carnac stones site (approximately 3,300 BC). Antiquity (6th century BC–5th century AD) Main articles: Gaul, Celts, and Roman Gaul Vercingetorix surrenders to Caesar during the Battle of Alesia. The Gallic defeat in the Gallic Wars secured the Roman conquest of the country. In 600 BC, Ionian Greeks from Phocaea founded the colony of Massalia (present-day Marseille), on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. This makes it France's oldest city.[31][32] At the same time, some Gallic Celtic tribes penetrated parts of Eastern and Northern France, gradually spreading through the rest of the country between the 5th and 3rd century BC.[33] The concept of Gaul emerged during this period, corresponding to the territories of Celtic settlement ranging between the Rhine, the Atlantic Ocean, the Pyrenees and the Mediterranean. The borders of modern France roughly correspond to ancient Gaul, which was inhabited by Celtic Gauls. Gaul was then a prosperous country, of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to Greek and Roman cultural and economic influences. The Maison Carrée was a temple of the Gallo-Roman city of Nemausus (present-day Nîmes) and is one of the best-preserved vestiges of the Roman Empire. Around 390 BC, the Gallic chieftain Brennus and his troops made their way to Italy through the Alps, defeated the Romans in the Battle of the Allia, and besieged and ransomed Rome.[34] The Gallic invasion left Rome weakened, and the Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC when they entered into a formal peace treaty with Rome.[35] But the Romans and the Gauls would remain adversaries for the next centuries, and the Gauls would continue to be a threat in Italy.[36] Around 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region Provincia Nostra (""Our Province""), which over time evolved into the name Provence in French.[37] Julius Caesar conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix in 52 BC.[38] According to Plutarch and the writings of scholar Brendan Woods, the Gallic Wars resulted in 800 conquered cities, 300 subdued tribes, one million men sold into slavery, and another three million dead in battle.[citation needed] Gaul was divided by Augustus into Roman provinces.[39] Many cities were founded during the Gallo-Roman period, including Lugdunum (present-day Lyon), which is considered the capital of the Gauls.[39] These cities were built in traditional Roman style, with a forum, a theatre, a circus, an amphitheatre and thermal baths. The Gauls mixed with Roman settlers and eventually adopted Roman culture and Roman speech (Latin, from which the French language evolved). The Roman polytheism merged with the Gallic paganism into the same syncretism. From the 250s to the 280s AD, Roman Gaul suffered a serious crisis with its fortified borders being attacked on several occasions by barbarians.[40] Nevertheless, the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, which was a period of revival and prosperity for Roman Gaul.[41] In 312, Emperor Constantine I converted to Christianity. Subsequently, Christians, who had been persecuted until then, increased rapidly across the entire Roman Empire.[42] But, from the beginning of the 5th century, the Barbarian Invasions resumed.[43] Teutonic tribes invaded the region from present-day Germany, the Visigoths settling in the southwest, the Burgundians along the Rhine River Valley, and the Franks (from whom the French take their name) in the north.[44] Early Middle Ages (5th–10th century) Main articles: Francia, Merovingian dynasty, and Carolingian dynasty See also: List of French monarchs and France in the Middle Ages Frankish expansion from 481 to 870 At the end of the Antiquity period, ancient Gaul was divided into several Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory, known as the Kingdom of Syagrius. Simultaneously, Celtic Britons, fleeing the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, settled the western part of Armorica. As a result, the Armorican peninsula was renamed Brittany, Celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region. The first leader to make himself king of all the Franks was Clovis I, who began his reign in 481, routing the last forces of the Roman governors of the province in 486. Clovis claimed that he would be baptized a Christian in the event of his victory against the Visigoths, which was said to have guaranteed the battle. Clovis regained the southwest from the Visigoths, was baptized in 508, and made himself master of what is now western Germany. Clovis I was the first Germanic conqueror after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity, rather than Arianism; thus France was given the title ""Eldest daughter of the Church"" (French: La fille aînée de l'Église) by the papacy,[45] and French kings would be called ""the Most Christian Kings of France"" (Rex Christianissimus). With Clovis's conversion to Catholicism in 498, the Frankish monarchy, elective and secular until then, became hereditary and of divine right. The Franks embraced the Christian Gallo-Roman culture and ancient Gaul was eventually renamed Francia (""Land of the Franks""). The Germanic Franks adopted Romanic languages, except in northern Gaul where Roman settlements were less dense and where Germanic languages emerged. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian dynasty, but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from Clovis's: Paris, Orléans, Soissons, and Rheims. The last Merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace (head of household). One mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated an Islamic invasion of Gaul at the Battle of Tours (732) and earned respect and power within the Frankish kingdoms. His son, Pepin the Short, seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the Carolingian dynasty. Pepin's son, Charlemagne, reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across Western and Central Europe. Proclaimed Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III and thus establishing in earnest the French Government's longtime historical association with the Catholic Church,[46] Charlemagne tried to revive the Western Roman Empire and its cultural grandeur. Charlemagne's son, Louis I (Emperor 814–840), kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive his death. In 843, under the Treaty of Verdun, the empire was divided between Louis' three sons, with East Francia going to Louis the German, Middle Francia to Lothair I, and West Francia to Charles the Bald. West Francia approximated the area occupied by, and was the precursor to, modern France.[47] During the 9th and 10th centuries, continually threatened by Viking invasions, France became a very decentralized state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen. Thus was established feudalism in France. Over time, some of the king's vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king. For example, after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror added ""King of England"" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of Normandy) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France, creating recurring tensions. High and Late Middle Ages (10th–15th century) Main articles: Kingdom of France, Capetian dynasty, Valois dynasty, and Bourbon dynasty See also: List of French monarchs and France in the Middle Ages Joan of Arc led the French army to several important victories during the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453), which paved the way for the final victory. Metropolitan France territorial evolution from 985 to 1947 The Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when Hugh Capet, Duke of France and Count of Paris, was crowned King of the Franks.[48] His descendants—the Capetians, the House of Valois and the House of Bourbon—progressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance into the Kingdom of France, which was fully declared in 1190 by Philip II of France (Philippe Auguste). Later kings would expand their directly possessed domaine royal to cover over half of modern continental France by the 15th century, including most of the north, centre and west of France. During this process, the royal authority became more and more assertive, centered on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility, clergy, and commoners. The French nobility played a prominent role in most Crusades to restore Christian access to the Holy Land. French knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the two-hundred-year span of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as Franj caring little whether they really came from France.[49] The French Crusaders also imported the French language into the Levant, making French the base of the lingua franca (litt. ""Frankish language"") of the Crusader states.[49] French knights also made up the majority in both the Hospital and the Temple orders. The latter, in particular, held numerous properties throughout France and by the 13th century were the principal bankers for the French crown, until Philip IV annihilated the order in 1307. The Albigensian Crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical Cathars in the southwestern area of modern-day France. In the end, the Cathars were exterminated and the autonomous County of Toulouse was annexed into the crown lands of France.[50] From the 11th century, the House of Plantagenet, the rulers of the County of Anjou, succeeded in establishing its dominion over the surrounding provinces of Maine and Touraine, then progressively built an ""empire"" that spanned from England to the Pyrenees and covering half of modern France. Tensions between the kingdom of France and the Plantagenet empire would last a hundred years, until Philip II of France conquered, between 1202 and 1214 most of the continental possessions of the empire, leaving England and Aquitaine to the Plantagenets. Following the Battle of Bouvines. Charles IV the Fair died without an heir in 1328.[51] Under the rules of the Salic law the crown of France could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line.[51] Accordingly, the crown passed to Philip of Valois, rather than through the female line to Edward of Plantagenet, who would soon become Edward III of England. During the reign of Philip of Valois, the French monarchy reached the height of its medieval power.[51] However Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward III of England in 1337, and England and France entered the off-and-on Hundred Years' War.[52] The exact boundaries changed greatly with time, but landholdings inside France by the English Kings remained extensive for decades. With charismatic leaders, such as Joan of Arc and La Hire, strong French counterattacks won back most English continental territories. Like the rest of Europe, France was struck by the Black Death; half of the 17 million population of France died.[53][54] Early modern period (15th century–1789) Main articles: French Renaissance, Early modern France, and Ancien Régime The Château de Chenonceau, nowadays part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was built in the early 16th century. The French Renaissance saw a spectacular cultural development and the first standardisation of the French language, which would become the official language of France and the language of Europe's aristocracy. It also saw a long set of wars, known as the Italian Wars, between France and the House of Habsburg. French explorers, such as Jacques Cartier or Samuel de Champlain, claimed lands in the Americas for France, paving the way for the expansion of the First French colonial empire. The rise of Protestantism in Europe led France to a civil war known as the French Wars of Religion, where, in the most notorious incident, thousands of Huguenots were murdered in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572.[55] The Wars of Religion were ended by Henry IV's Edict of Nantes, which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots. Spanish troops, the terror of Western Europe,[56] assisted the Catholic side during the Wars of Religion in 1589–1594, and invaded northern France in 1597; after some skirmishing in the 1620s and 1630s, Spain and France returned to all-out war between 1635 and 1659. The war cost France 300,000 casualties.[57] Under Louis XIII, the energetic Cardinal Richelieu promoted the centralisation of the state and reinforced the royal power by disarming domestic power holders in the 1620s. He systematically destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private violence (dueling, carrying weapons and maintaining private armies). By the end of the 1620s, Richelieu established ""the royal monopoly of force"" as the doctrine.[58] During Louis XIV's minority and the regency of Queen Anne and Cardinal Mazarin, a period of trouble known as the Fronde occurred in France. This rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal absolute power in France. Louis XIV, the ""sun king"" was the absolute monarch of France and made France the leading European power. The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV (1643–1715). By turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the Palace of Versailles, Louis XIV's personal power became unchallenged. Remembered for his numerous wars, he made France the leading European power. France became the most populous country in Europe and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the 20th century.[59] France obtained many overseas possessions in the Americas, Africa and Asia. Louis XIV also revoked the Edict of Nantes, forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile. Under the wars of Louis XV (r. 1715–1774), France lost New France and most of its Indian possessions after its defeat in the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). Its European territory kept growing, however, with notable acquisitions such as Lorraine (1766) and Corsica (1770). An unpopular king, Louis XV's weak rule, his ill-advised financial, political and military decisions – as well as the debauchery of his court– discredited the monarchy, which arguably paved the way for the French Revolution 15 years after his death.[60][61] Louis XVI (r. 1774–1793), actively supported the Americans with money, fleets and armies, helping them win independence from Great Britain. France gained revenge but spent so heavily that the government verged on bankruptcy--a factor that contributed to the French Revolution. Much of the Enlightenment occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the discovery of oxygen (1778) and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers (1783), were achieved by French scientists. French explorers, such as Bougainville and Lapérouse, took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe. The Enlightenment philosophy, in which reason is advocated as the primary source for legitimacy, undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and also was a factor in the French Revolution. Revolutionary France (1789–1799) Main articles: History of France § Revolutionary France (1789–1799), and French Revolution Ouverture des États généraux à Versailles, 5 mai 1789 by Auguste Couder The Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 was the most emblematic event of the French Revolution. Facing financial troubles, King Louis XVI summoned the Estates-General (gathering the three Estates of the realm) in May 1789 to propose solutions to his government. As it came to an impasse, the representatives of the Third Estate formed into a National Assembly, signalling the outbreak of the French Revolution. Fearing that the king would suppress the newly created National Assembly, insurgents stormed the Bastille on 14 July 1789, a date which would become France's National Day. In early August 1789, the National Constituent Assembly abolished the privileges of the nobility such as personal serfdom and exclusive hunting rights. Through the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (27 August 1789) France established fundamental rights for men. The Declaration affirms ""the natural and imprescriptible rights of man"" to ""liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression"". Freedom of speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests outlawed. It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men, as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth. In November 1789, the Assembly decided to nationalise and sell all property of the Catholic Church which had been the largest landowner in the country. In July 1790, a Civil Constitution of the Clergy reorganized the French Catholic Church, cancelling the authority of the Church to levy taxes, et cetera. This fueled much discontent in parts of France, which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some years later. While King Louis XVI still enjoyed popularity among the population, his disastrous flight to Varennes (June 1791) seemed to justify rumors he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion. His credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility. In August 1791, the Emperor of Austria and the King of Prussia in the Declaration of Pillnitz threatened revolutionary France to intervene by force of arms to restore the French absolute monarchy. In September 1791, the National Constituent Assembly forced King Louis XVI to accept the French Constitution of 1791, thus turning the French absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy. In the newly established Legislative Assembly (October 1791), enmity developed and deepened between a group, later called the 'Girondins', who favored war with Austria and Prussia, and a group later called 'Montagnards' or 'Jacobins', who opposed such a war. A majority in the Assembly in 1792 however saw a war with Austria and Prussia as a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government, and thought that France would win a war against those gathered monarchies. On 20 April 1792, therefore, they declared war on Austria. Le Serment du Jeu de paume by Jacques-Louis David, 1791 On 10 August 1792, an angry crowd threatened the palace of King Louis XVI, who took refuge in the Legislative Assembly.[62][63] A Prussian Army invaded France later in August 1792. In early September, Parisians, infuriated by the Prussian Army capturing Verdun and counter-revolutionary uprisings in the west of France, murdered between 1,000 and 1,500 prisoners by raiding the Parisian prisons. The Assembly and the Paris City Council seemed unable to stop that bloodshed.[62][64] The National Convention, chosen in the first elections under male universal suffrage,[62] on 20 September 1792 succeeded the Legislative Assembly and on 21 September abolished the monarchy by proclaiming the French First Republic. Ex-King Louis XVI was convicted of treason and guillotined in January 1793. France had declared war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic in November 1792 and did the same on Spain in March 1793; in the spring of 1793, Austria and Prussia invaded France; in March, France created a ""sister republic"" in the ""Republic of Mainz"", and kept it under control. Also in March 1793, the civil war of the Vendée against Paris started, evoked by both the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 1790 and the nationwide army conscription early 1793; elsewhere in France rebellion was brewing too. A factionalist feud in the National Convention, smoldering ever since October 1791, came to a climax with the group of the 'Girondins' on 2 June 1793 being forced to resign and leave the convention. The counter-revolution, begun in March 1793 in the Vendée, by July had spread to Brittany, Normandy, Bordeaux, Marseilles, Toulon, and Lyon. Paris' Convention government between October and December 1793 with brutal measures managed to subdue most internal uprisings, at the cost of tens of thousands of lives. Some historians consider the civil war to have lasted until 1796 with a toll of possibly 450,000 lives.[65][66] By the end of 1793 the allies had been driven from France. France in February 1794 abolished slavery in its American colonies, but would reintroduce it later. Political disagreements and enmity in the National Convention between October 1793 and July 1794 reached unprecedented levels, leading to dozens of Convention members being sentenced to death and guillotined. Meanwhile, France's external wars in 1794 were going prosperous, for example in Belgium. In 1795, the government seemed to return to indifference towards the desires and needs of the lower classes concerning freedom of (Catholic) religion and fair distribution of food. Until 1799, politicians, apart from inventing a new parliamentary system (the 'Directory'), busied themselves with dissuading the people from Catholicism and from royalism. Napoleon and 19th century (1799–1914) Main articles: History of France § Napoleonic France (1799–1815); History of France § Long 19th century, 1815–1914; First French Empire; Second French Empire; and French colonial empire See also: France in the 19th century and France in the 20th century Napoleon, Emperor of the French, built a vast empire across Europe. His conquests spread the ideals of the French Revolution across much of the continent, such as popular sovereignty, equality before the law, republicanism and administrative reorganisation while his legal reforms had a major impact worldwide. Nationalism, especially in Germany, emerged in reaction against him.[67] Napoleon Bonaparte seized control of the Republic in 1799 becoming First Consul and later Emperor of the French Empire (1804–1814; 1815). As a continuation of the wars sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic, changing sets of European Coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's Empire. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the battles of Jena-Auerstadt or Austerlitz. Members of the Bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.[68] These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the metric system, the Napoleonic Code and the Declaration of the Rights of Man. In June 1812, Napoleon attacked Russia, reaching Moscow. Thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease, Russian attacks, and finally winter. After the catastrophic Russian campaign, and the ensuing uprising of European monarchies against his rule, Napoleon was defeated and the Bourbon monarchy restored. About a million Frenchmen died during the Napoleonic Wars.[68] After his brief return from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, the monarchy was re-established (1815–1830), with new constitutional limitations. The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the July Revolution of 1830, which established the constitutional July Monarchy. In that year, French troops conquered Algeria, establishing the first colonial presence in Africa since Napoleon's abortive invasion of Egypt in 1798. In 1848, general unrest led to the February Revolution and the end of the July Monarchy. The abolition of slavery and introduction of male universal suffrage, which were briefly enacted during the French Revolution, were re-enacted in 1848. In 1852, the president of the French Republic, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the Second Empire, as Napoleon III. He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially in Crimea, in Mexico and Italy which resulted in the annexation of the Duchy of Savoy and the County of Nice, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and his regime was replaced by the Third Republic. By 1875, the French conquest of Algeria was complete and approximately 825,000 Algerians were killed as a result.[69] Animated map of the growth and decline of the French colonial empire France had colonial possessions, in various forms, since the beginning of the 17th century, but in the 19th and 20th centuries, its global overseas colonial empire extended greatly and became the second largest in the world behind the British Empire. Including metropolitan France, the total area of land under French sovereignty almost reached 13 million square kilometers in the 1920s and 1930s, 8.6% of the world's land. Known as the Belle Époque, the turn of the century was a period characterised by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. In 1905, state secularism was officially established. Contemporary period (1914–present) Main article: History of France (1900 to present) French Poilus posing with their war-torn flag in 1917, during World War I France was invaded by Germany and defended by Great Britain to start World War I in August 1914. A rich industrial area in the northeast was occupied. France and the Allies emerged victorious against the Central Powers at a tremendous human and material cost. World War I left 1.4 million French soldiers dead, 4% of its population.[70] Between 27 and 30% of soldiers conscripted from 1912 to 1915 were killed.[71] The interbellum years were marked by intense international tensions and a variety of social reforms introduced by the Popular Front government (annual leave, eight-hour workdays, women in government). In 1940, France was invaded and quickly defeated by Nazi Germany. France was divided into a German occupation zone in the north, an Italian occupation zone in the southeast and an unoccupied territory, the rest of France, which consisted of the southern French metropolitan territory (two-fifths of pre-war metropolitan France) and the French empire, which included the two protectorates of French Tunisia and French Morocco, and French Algeria; the Vichy government, a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with Germany, ruled the unoccupied territory. Free France, the government-in-exile led by Charles de Gaulle, was set up in London.[72][full citation needed] From 1942 to 1944, about 160,000 French citizens, including around 75,000 Jews,[72][73][74] were deported to death camps and concentration camps in Germany and occupied Poland.[75] In September 1943, Corsica was the first French metropolitan territory to liberate itself from the Axis. On 6 June 1944, the Allies invaded Normandy and in August they invaded Provence. Over the following year the Allies and the French Resistance emerged victorious over the Axis powers and French sovereignty was restored with the establishment of the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF). This interim government, established by de Gaulle, aimed to continue to wage war against Germany and to purge collaborators from office. It also made several important reforms (suffrage extended to women, creation of a social security system). Charles de Gaulle took an active part in many major events of the 20th century: a hero of World War I, leader of the Free French during World War II, he then became President, where he facilitated decolonisation, maintained France as a major power and overcame the revolt of May 1968. The GPRF laid the groundwork for a new constitutional order that resulted in the Fourth Republic, which saw spectacular economic growth (les Trente Glorieuses). France was one of the founding members of NATO (1949). France attempted to regain control of French Indochina but was defeated by the Viet Minh in 1954 at the climactic Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Only months later, France faced another anti-colonialist conflict in Algeria. The systematic torture and repression, as well as the extrajudicial killings that were perpetrated to keep control of Algeria, then treated as an integral part of France and home to over one million European settlers,[76][77] wracked the country and nearly led to a coup and civil war.[78] In 1958, the weak and unstable Fourth Republic gave way to the Fifth Republic, which included a strengthened Presidency.[79] In the latter role, Charles de Gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the Algerian War. The war was concluded with the Évian Accords in 1962 that led to Algerian independence. The Algerian independence came at a high price: namely, the large toll on the Algerian population. It resulted in half million to a million deaths and over 2 million internally displaced Algerians.[80][81][82] A vestige of the colonial empire are the French overseas departments and territories. The May 68 protests, a massive social movement, would ultimately led to many social changes, such as the right to abortion, women empowerment as well as the decriminalisation of homosexuality.[83][84] In the context of the Cold War, De Gaulle pursued a policy of ""national independence"" towards the Western and Eastern blocs. To this end, he withdrew from NATO's military integrated command (while remaining in the NATO alliance itself), launched a nuclear development programme and made France the fourth nuclear power. He restored cordial Franco-German relations to create a European counterweight between the American and Soviet spheres of influence. However, he opposed any development of a supranational Europe, favouring a Europe of sovereign nations. In the wake of the series of worldwide protests of 1968, the revolt of May 1968 had an enormous social impact. In France, it was the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal (secularism, individualism, sexual revolution). Although the revolt was a political failure (as the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before) it announced a split between the French people and de Gaulle who resigned shortly after.[85] In the post-Gaullist era, France remained one of the most developed economies in the world, but faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries France has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational European Union, notably by signing the Maastricht Treaty (which created the European Union) in 1992, establishing the Eurozone in 1999 and signing the Lisbon Treaty in 2007.[86] France has also gradually but fully reintegrated into NATO and has since participated in most NATO sponsored wars.[87] Republican marches were organised across France after the January 2015 attacks perpetrated by Islamist terrorists; they became the largest public rallies in French history. Since the 19th century France has received many immigrants. These have been mostly male foreign workers from European Catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed.[88] During the 1970s France faced economic crisis and allowed new immigrants (mostly from the Maghreb)[88] to permanently settle in France with their families and to acquire French citizenship. It resulted in hundreds of thousands of Muslims (especially in the larger cities) living in subsidised public housing and suffering from very high unemployment rates.[89] Simultaneously France renounced the assimilation of immigrants, where they were expected to adhere to French traditional values and cultural norms. They were encouraged to retain their distinctive cultures and traditions and required merely to integrate.[90] Since the 1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings, France has been sporadically targeted by Islamist organisations, notably the Charlie Hebdo attack in January 2015 which provoked the largest public rallies in French history, gathering 4.4 million people,[91][92] the November 2015 Paris attacks which resulted in 130 deaths, the deadliest attack on French soil since World War II[93][94] and the deadliest in the European Union since the Madrid train bombings in 2004,[95] as well as the 2016 Nice truck attack, which caused 87 deaths during Bastille Day celebrations. Opération Chammal, France's military efforts to contain ISIS, killed over 1,000 ISIS troops between 2014 and 2015.[96][97] Geography Main article: Geography of France Location and borders A relief map of Metropolitan France, showing cities with over 100,000 inhabitants Mont Blanc, the highest summit in Western Europe, marks the border with Italy. The vast majority of France's territory and population is situated in Western Europe and is called Metropolitan France, to distinguish it from the country's various overseas polities. It is bordered by the North Sea in the north, the English Channel in the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean sea in the southeast. Its land borders consist of Belgium and Luxembourg in the northeast, Germany and Switzerland in the east, Italy and Monaco in the southeast, and Andorra and Spain in the south and southwest. With the exception of the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south and southeast, the Pyrenees and the Alps and the Jura, respectively, and to the east, the Rhine river. Due to its shape, France is often referred to as l'Hexagone (""The Hexagon""). Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is Corsica. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes 41° and 51° N, and longitudes 6° W and 10° E, on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern temperate zone. Its continental part covers about 1000 km from north to south and from east to west. France has several overseas regions across the world, which are organized as follows: In South America: French Guiana. In the Atlantic Ocean: Saint Pierre and Miquelon and, in the Antilles: Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy. In the Pacific Ocean: French Polynesia, the special collectivity of New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna and Clipperton Island. In the Indian Ocean: Réunion island, Mayotte, Kerguelen Islands, Crozet Islands, St. Paul and Amsterdam islands, and the Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean In the Antarctic: Adélie Land. France has land borders with Brazil and Suriname via French Guiana and with the Kingdom of the Netherlands through the French portion of Saint Martin. Metropolitan France covers 551,500 square kilometres (212,935 sq mi),[98] the largest among European Union members.[20] France's total land area, with its overseas departments and territories (excluding Adélie Land), is 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi), 0.45% of the total land area on Earth. France possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the Alps in the southeast, the Massif Central in the south central and Pyrenees in the southwest. Due to its numerous overseas departments and territories scattered across the planet, France possesses the second-largest Exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the world, covering 11,035,000 km2 (4,260,000 mi2), just behind the EEZ of the United States, which covers 11,351,000 km2 (4,383,000 mi2), but ahead of the EEZ of Australia, which covers 8,148,250 km2 (4,111,312 mi2). Its EEZ covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world. Geology, topography and hydrography Geological formations near Roussillon, Vaucluse Metropolitan France has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes. Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, during which the Armorican Massif, the Massif Central, the Morvan, the Vosges and Ardennes ranges and the island of Corsica were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north, the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of Beauce and Brie. Various routes of natural passage, such as the Rhône Valley, allow easy communications. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. At 4,810.45 metres (15,782 ft)[99] above sea level, Mont Blanc, located in the Alps on the French and Italian border, is the highest point in Western Europe. Although 60% of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks, these risks remain moderate. Reed bed on the Gironde estuary, the largest estuary in Western Europe The coastlines offer contrasting landscapes: mountain ranges along the French Riviera, coastal cliffs such as the Côte d'Albâtre, and wide sandy plains in the Languedoc. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast. France has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, the Rhône and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory. The Rhône divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Camargue. The Garonne meets the Dordogne just after Bordeaux, forming the Gironde estuary, the largest estuary in Western Europe which after approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) empties into the Atlantic Ocean.[100] Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the north-eastern borders. France has 11 million square kilometres (4.2×10^6 sq mi) of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97% are overseas.

Climate change in France includes above average heating.[101] Environment See also: List of national parks of France and Regional natural parks of France Marine (blue), regional (green) and national (red) parks in France (2019) France was one of the first countries to create an environment ministry, in 1971.[102] Although it is one of the most industrialised countries in the world, France is ranked only 19th by carbon dioxide emissions, behind less populous nations such as Canada or Australia. This is due to the country's heavy investment in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis,[103] which now accounts for 75 percent of its electricity production[104] and results in less pollution.[105][106] According to the 2018 Environmental Performance Index conducted by Yale and Columbia, France was the second-most environmentally-conscious country in the world (after Switzerland), compared to tenth place in 2016 and 27th in 2014.[107][108] The forest of Rambouillet in Yvelines illustrates France's flora diversity. Like all European Union state members, France agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20% of 1990 levels by the year 2020,[109] compared to the United States plan to reduce emissions by 4% of 1990 levels.[110] As of 2009[update], French carbon dioxide emissions per capita were lower than that of China's.[111] The country was set to impose a carbon tax in 2009 at 17 euros per tonne of carbon emitted,[112] which would have raised 4 billion euros of revenue annually.[113] However, the plan was abandoned due to fears of burdening French businesses.[114] Calanques National Park in Bouches-du-Rhône is one of the best known protected areas of France. Forests account for 31 percent of France's land area—the fourth-highest proportion in Europe—representing an increase of 7 percent since 1990.[115][116][117] French forests are some of the most diverse in Europe, comprising more than 140 species of trees.[118] France had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.52/10, ranking it 123rd globally out of 172 countries.[119] There are nine national parks[120] and 46 natural parks in France,[121] with the government planning to convert 20% of its Exclusive economic zone into a Marine protected area by 2020.[122] A regional nature park[123] (French: parc naturel régional or PNR) is a public establishment in France between local authorities and the national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty, to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development in the area.[124] A PNR sets goals and guidelines for managed human habitation, sustainable economic development and protection of the natural environment based on each park's unique landscape and heritage. The parks foster ecological research programs and public education in the natural sciences.[125] As of 2019[update] there are 54 PNRs in France.[126] Administrative divisions Main article: Administrative divisions of France The French Republic is divided into 18 regions (located in Europe and overseas), five overseas collectivities, one overseas territory, one special collectivity – New Caledonia and one uninhabited island directly under the authority of the Minister of Overseas France – Clipperton. Regions Hauts-de-France Normandy Île-de-France Grand Est Bourgogne-Franche-Comté Centre-Val de Loire Pays de la Loire Brittany Nouvelle-Aquitaine Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Occitanie Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur Corsica French Guiana Guadeloupe Martinique Mayotte RéunionBelgium Luxembourg Germany Switzerland Italy United Kingdom Andorra Brazil Suriname SpainChannel Bay ofBiscay LigurianSea MediterraneanSea Since 2016, France is mainly divided into 18 administrative regions: 13 regions in metropolitan France (including the territorial collectivity of Corsica),[127] and five located overseas.[98] The regions are further subdivided into 101 departments,[128] which are numbered mainly alphabetically. This number is used in postal codes and was formerly used on vehicle number plates. Among the 101 departments of France, five (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Réunion) are in overseas regions (ROMs) that are also simultaneously overseas departments (DOMs), enjoy exactly the same status as metropolitan departments and are an integral part of the European Union. The 101 departments are subdivided into 335 arrondissements, which are, in turn, subdivided into 2,054 cantons.[129] These cantons are then divided into 36,658 communes, which are municipalities with an elected municipal council.[129] Three communes—Paris, Lyon and Marseille—are subdivided into 45 municipal arrondissements. The regions, departments and communes are all known as territorial collectivities, meaning they possess local assemblies as well as an executive. Arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions. However, this was not always the case. Until 1940, the arrondissements were territorial collectivities with an elected assembly, but these were suspended by the Vichy regime and definitely abolished by the Fourth Republic in 1946. Overseas territories and collectivities In addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments, the French Republic has five overseas collectivities (French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna), one sui generis collectivity (New Caledonia), one overseas territory (French Southern and Antarctic Lands), and one island possession in the Pacific Ocean (Clipperton Island). Overseas collectivities and territories form part of the French Republic, but do not form part of the European Union or its fiscal area (with the exception of St. Bartelemy, which seceded from Guadeloupe in 2007). The Pacific Collectivities (COMs) of French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia continue to use the CFP franc[130] whose value is strictly linked to that of the euro. In contrast, the five overseas regions used the French franc and now use the euro.[131] The lands making up the French Republic, shown at the same geographic scale Name Constitutional status Capital Clipperton Island State private property under the direct authority of the French government Uninhabited French Polynesia Designated as an overseas land (pays d'outre-mer or POM), the status is the same as an overseas collectivity.

Mata-Utu Politics Main article: Politics of France Government Emmanuel MacronPresident Jean CastexPrime minister The French Republic is a unitary semi-presidential representative democratic republic with strong democratic traditions.[132] The Constitution of the Fifth Republic was approved by referendum on 28 September 1958.[133] It greatly strengthened the authority of the executive in relation to Parliament. The executive branch itself has two leaders. The president of the Republic, currently Emmanuel Macron, is the head of state, elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a 5-year term (formerly 7 years).[134] The prime minister, currently Jean Castex, is the head of government, appointed by the president of the Republic to lead the Government of France. The National Assembly is the lower house of the French Parliament. The French Parliament is a bicameral legislature comprising a National Assembly (Assemblée nationale) and a Senate.[135] The National Assembly deputies represent local constituencies and are directly elected for 5-year terms.[136] The Assembly has the power to dismiss the government; thus the majority in the Assembly determines the choice of government. Senators are chosen by an electoral college for 6-year terms (originally 9-year terms); one half of the seats are submitted to election every 3 years.[137] The Senate's legislative powers are limited; in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say.[138] The Government has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of Parliament. Until World War II, Radicals were a strong political force in France, embodied by the Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party which was the most important party of the Third Republic. Since World War II, they were marginalized while French politics became characterized by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, centred on the French Section of the Workers' International and its successor the Socialist Party (since 1969); and the other right-wing, centred on the Gaullist Party, whose name changed over time to the Rally of the French People (1947), the Union of Democrats for the Republic (1958), the Rally for the Republic (1976), the Union for a Popular Movement (2007) and The Republicans (since 2015). In the 2017 presidential and legislative elections, radical centrist party En Marche! became the dominant force, overtaking both Socialists and Republicans. As of 2017, voter turnout was 75 percent during recent elections, higher than the OECD average of 68 percent.[139] Law Main article: Law of France France uses a civil legal system, wherein law arises primarily from written statutes;[98] judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law in a common law system). Basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the Napoleonic Code (which was, in turn, largely based on the royal law codified under Louis XIV). In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As Guy Canivet, first president of the Court of Cassation, wrote about the management of prisons: ""Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality."" That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy. The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. French law is divided into two principal areas: private law and public law. Private law includes, in particular, civil law and criminal law. Public law includes, in particular, administrative law and constitutional law. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law, and administrative law. Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminal ex post facto laws are prohibited).[140] While administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries, it is completely separated in France and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court: ordinary courts (which handle criminal and civil litigation) are headed by the Court of Cassation and administrative courts are headed by the Council of State. To be applicable, every law must be officially published in the Journal officiel de la République française. France does not recognise religious law as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions; it has long abolished blasphemy laws and sodomy laws (the latter in 1791). However, ""offences against public decency"" (contraires aux bonnes mœurs) or disturbing public order (trouble à l'ordre public) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution. Since 1999, civil unions for homosexual couples are permitted, and since 2013, same-sex marriage and LGBT adoption are legal.[141] Laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881. Some consider hate speech laws in France to be too broad or severe, undermining freedom of speech.[142] France has laws against racism and antisemitism,[143] while the 1990 Gayssot Act prohibits Holocaust denial. Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State is the basis for laïcité (state secularism): the state does not formally recognize any religion, except in Alsace-Moselle. Nonetheless, it does recognize religious associations. The Parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995, and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004. In 2010, it banned the wearing of face-covering Islamic veils in public; human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch described the law as discriminatory towards Muslims.[144][145] However, it is supported by most of the population.[146] Foreign relations Main article: Foreign relations of France 88 states and governments are part of La Francophonie,[147] which promotes values of democracy, multilingualism and cultural diversity.[148] France has been a key member of this global organization since its inception in 1970. France is a founding member of the United Nations and serves as one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council with veto rights.[149] In 2015, France was described as being ""the best networked state in the world"", because it is a country that ""is member of more multi-lateral organisations than any other country"".[150] France is a member of the G8, World Trade Organization (WTO),[151] the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC)[152] and the Indian Ocean Commission (COI).[153] It is an associate member of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS)[154] and a leading member of the International Francophone Organisation (OIF) of 84 fully or partly French-speaking countries.[155] As a significant hub for international relations, France hosts the second largest assembly of diplomatic missions in the world and the headquarters of international organisations including the OECD, UNESCO, Interpol, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and la Francophonie.[156] Postwar French foreign policy has been largely shaped by membership of the European Union, of which it was a founding member. Since the 1960s, France has developed close ties with reunified Germany to become the most influential driving force of the EU.[157] In the 1960s, France sought to exclude the British from the European unification process,[158] seeking to build its own standing in continental Europe. However, since 1904, France has maintained an ""Entente cordiale"" with the United Kingdom, and there has been a strengthening of links between the countries, especially militarily. The European Parliament in Strasbourg, near the border with (Germany). France is a founding member of all EU institutions. France is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), but under President de Gaulle, it excluded itself from the joint military command to protest the Special Relationship between the United States and Britain and to preserve the independence of French foreign and security policies. However, as a result of Nicolas Sarkozy's pro-American politics (much criticised in France by the leftists and by a part of the right), France re-joined the NATO joint military command on 4 April 2009.[159][160][161] In the early 1990s, the country drew considerable criticism from other nations for its underground nuclear tests in French Polynesia.[162] France vigorously opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq,[163][164] straining bilateral relations with the United States[165][166] and the United Kingdom. France retains strong political and economic influence in its former African colonies (Françafrique)[167] and has supplied economic aid and troops for peacekeeping missions in Ivory Coast and Chad.[168] Recently, after the unilateral declaration of independence of Northern Mali by the Tuareg MNLA and the subsequent regional Northern Mali conflict with several Islamist groups including Ansar Dine and MOJWA, France and other African states intervened to help the Malian Army to retake control. In 2017, France was the fourth-largest donor (in absolute terms) of development aid in the world, behind the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.[169] This represents 0.43% of its GNP, the 12th highest among the OECD.[170] The organisation managing the French help is the French Development Agency, which finances primarily humanitarian projects in sub-Saharan Africa.[171] The main goals of this support are ""developing infrastructure, access to health care and education, the implementation of appropriate economic policies and the consolidation of the rule of law and democracy"".[171] Military Main article: French Armed Forces Examples of France's military. Clockwise from top left: nuclear aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle; a Dassault Rafale fighter aircraft; French Chasseurs Alpins patrolling the valleys of Kapisa province in Afghanistan; a Leclerc tank The French Armed Forces (Forces armées françaises) are the military and paramilitary forces of France, under the President of the Republic as supreme commander. They consist of the French Army (Armée de Terre), French Navy (Marine Nationale, formerly called Armée de Mer), the French Air and Space Force (Armée de l'Air et de l’Espace), and the Military Police called National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie nationale), which also fulfils civil police duties in the rural areas of France. Together they are among the largest armed forces in the world and the largest in the EU. According to a 2018 study by Crédit Suisse, the French Armed Forces are ranked as the world's sixth-most powerful military, and the most powerful in Europe, only behind Russia.[172] While the Gendarmerie is an integral part of the French armed forces (gendarmes are career soldiers), and therefore under the purview of the Ministry of the Armed Forces, it is operationally attached to the Ministry of the Interior as far as its civil police duties are concerned. When acting as general purpose police force, the Gendarmerie encompasses the counter terrorist units of the Parachute Intervention Squadron of the National Gendarmerie (Escadron Parachutiste d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale), the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group (Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale), the Search Sections of the National Gendarmerie (Sections de Recherche de la Gendarmerie Nationale), responsible for criminal enquiries, and the Mobile Brigades of the National Gendarmerie (Brigades mobiles de la Gendarmerie Nationale, or in short Gendarmerie mobile) which have the task to maintain public order. The following special units are also part of the Gendarmerie: the Republican Guard (Garde républicaine) which protects public buildings hosting major French institutions, the Maritime Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie maritime) serving as Coast Guard, the Provost Service (Prévôté), acting as the Military Police branch of the Gendarmerie. Bastille Day in ParisNational GendarmerieCombined Arms SchoolNational Active Non-Commissioned Officers School As far as the French intelligence units are concerned, the Directorate-General for External Security (Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure) is considered to be a component of the Armed Forces under the authority of the Ministry of Defense. The other, the Central Directorate for Interior Intelligence (Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur) is a division of the National Police Force (Direction générale de la Police Nationale), and therefore reports directly to the Ministry of the Interior. There has been no national conscription since 1997.[173] France has a special military corps, the French Foreign Legion, founded in 1830, which consists of foreign nationals from over 140 countries who are willing to serve in the French Armed Forces and become French citizens after the end of their service period. The only other countries having similar units are Spain (the Spanish Foreign Legion, called Tercio, was founded in 1920) and Luxembourg (foreigners can serve in the National Army provided they speak Luxembourgish). France is a permanent member of the Security Council of the UN, and a recognised nuclear state since 1960. France has signed and ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)[174] and acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. France's annual military expenditure in 2018 was US$63.8 billion, or 2.3% of its GDP, making it the fifth biggest military spender in the world after the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, and India.[175] French nuclear deterrence, (formerly known as ""Force de Frappe""), relies on complete independence. The current French nuclear force consists of four Triomphant class submarines equipped with submarine-launched ballistic missiles. In addition to the submarine fleet, it is estimated that France has about 60 ASMP medium-range air-to-ground missiles with nuclear warheads,[176] of which around 50 are deployed by the Air and Space Force using the Mirage 2000N long-range nuclear strike aircraft, while around 10 are deployed by the French Navy's Super Étendard Modernisé (SEM) attack aircraft, which operate from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. The new Rafale F3 aircraft will gradually replace all Mirage 2000N and SEM in the nuclear strike role with the improved ASMP-A missile with a nuclear warhead. France has major military industries with one of the largest aerospace industries in the world.[177][178] Its industries have produced such equipment as the Rafale fighter, the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, the Exocet missile and the Leclerc tank among others. Despite withdrawing from the Eurofighter project, France is actively investing in European joint projects such as the Eurocopter Tiger, multipurpose frigates, the UCAV demonstrator nEUROn and the Airbus A400M. France is a major arms seller,[179][180] with most of its arsenal's designs available for the export market with the notable exception of nuclear-powered devices. France has consistently developed its cybersecurity capabilities, which are regularly ranked as some of the most robust of any nation of the world.[181][182] The Bastille Day military parade held in Paris each 14 July for France's national day, called Bastille Day in English-speaking countries (referred to in France as Fête nationale), is the oldest and largest regular military parade in Europe. Other smaller parades are organised across the country. Government finance See also: Taxation in France The Government of France has run a budget deficit each year since the early 1970s. As of 2016[update], French government debt levels reached 2.2 trillion euros, the equivalent of 96.4% of French GDP.[183] In late 2012, credit rating agencies warned that growing French Government debt levels risked France's AAA credit rating, raising the possibility of a future downgrade and subsequent higher borrowing costs for the French authorities.[184] However, in July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the French government issued 10-years bonds which had negative interest rates, for the first time in its history.[185] France also possesses in 2020 the fourth-largest gold reserves in the world.[186] Economy Main article: Economy of France La Défense (as seen from the Eiffel Tower) was in 2017 ranked by Ernst & Young as the leading Central business district in continental Europe, and the fourth in the world.[187] A member of the Group of Seven (formerly Group of Eight) leading industrialized countries, as of 2020[update], it is ranked as the world's tenth largest and the EU's second largest economy by purchasing power parity.[188] France joined 11 other EU members to launch the euro in 1999, with euro coins and banknotes completely replacing the French franc (₣) in 2002.[189] France has a diversified economy,[190] that is dominated by the service sector (which represented in 2017 78.8% of its GDP), whilst the industrial sector accounted for 19.5% of its GDP and the primary sector accounted for the remaining 1.7%.[191] The fifth largest trading nation in the world (and second in Europe after Germany). It is the third largest manufacturing country in Europe behind Germany and Italy. France is also the most visited destination in the world,[192][193] as well the European Union's leading agricultural power.[194] France was in 2019 the largest Foreign Direct Investment recipient in Europe,[195] Europe's second largest spender in Research and development,[196] ranked among the 10 most innovative countries in the world by the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index,[197] as well as the 15th most competitive nation globally, according to the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report (up 2 notches compared to 2018).[198] According to the IMF, in 2020, France was the world's 20th country by GDP per capita with $39,257 per inhabitant. In 2019, France was listed on the United Nations's Human Development Index with a value of 0.901 (indicating very high human development) and 23rd on the Corruption Perceptions Index in 2019.[199][200] Composition of the French economy (GDP) in 2016 by expenditure type In 2018, France was the 5th largest trading nation in the world, as well as the second-largest trading nation in Europe (after Germany).[201] France is part of a monetary union, the Eurozone (dark blue), and of the European Single Market (lighter blue). Financial services, banking and the insurance sector are an important part of the economy. Three largest financial institutions cooperatively owned by their customers are located in France.[202] The Paris stock exchange (French: La Bourse de Paris) is an old institution, created by Louis XV in 1724.[203] In 2000, the stock exchanges of Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels merged into Euronext.[204] In 2007, Euronext merged with the New York stock exchange to form NYSE Euronext, the world's largest stock exchange.[204] Euronext Paris, the French branch of the NYSE Euronext group is Europe's 2nd largest stock exchange market, behind the London Stock Exchange. French companies have maintained key positions in the insurance and banking industries: AXA was in 2019 the world's third largest insurance company by total non banking assets.[205] The leading French banks are BNP Paribas and the Crédit Agricole, both ranking among the top 10 largest banks by assets according to a 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence report.[206] According to the same source, Société Générale and Groupe BPCE were in 2020 the world's 17th and 19th largest banks, respectively.[206] France is a member of the Eurozone (around 330 million consumers) which is part of the European Single Market (more than 500 million consumers). Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union (EU) members and by EU legislation. France introduced the common European currency, the Euro in 2002.[207][208] Agriculture Champagne is from the Champagne region in Northeast France. France has historically been a large producer of agricultural products.[209] Extensive tracts of fertile land, the application of modern technology, and EU subsidies have combined to make France the leading agricultural producer and exporter in Europe[210] (representing 20% of the EU's agricultural production)[211] and the world's third biggest exporter of agricultural products.[212] Wheat, poultry, dairy, beef, and pork, as well as internationally recognized processed foods are the primary French agricultural exports. Rosé wines are primarily consumed within the country, but Champagne and Bordeaux wines are major exports, being known worldwide. EU agriculture subsidies to France have decreased in recent years but still amounted to $8 billion in 2007.[213] That same year, France sold 33.4 billion euros of transformed agricultural products.[214] France produces rum via sugar cane-based distilleries almost all of which are located in overseas territories such as Martinique, Guadeloupe and La Réunion. Agriculture is an important sector of France's economy: 3.8% of the active population is employed in agriculture, whereas the total agri-food industry made up 4.2% of French GDP in 2005.[211] Tourism Main article: Tourism in France The Eiffel Tower is the world's most visited paid monument, an icon of both Paris and France. The Château de Marqueyssac, featuring a French formal garden, is one of the Remarkable Gardens of France. With 89 million international tourist arrivals in 2018,[215] France is ranked as the first tourist destination in the world, ahead of Spain (83 million) and the United States (80 million). It is third in income from tourism due to shorter duration of visits.[216] The most popular tourist sites include (annual visitors): Eiffel Tower (6.2 million), Château de Versailles (2.8 million), Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle (2 million), Pont du Gard (1.5 million), Arc de Triomphe (1.2 million), Mont Saint-Michel (1 million), Sainte-Chapelle (683,000), Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg (549,000), Puy de Dôme (500,000), Musée Picasso (441,000), and Carcassonne (362,000).[217] Paris region France, especially Paris, has some of the world's largest and most renowned museums, including the Louvre, which is the most visited art museum in the world (5.7 million), the Musée d'Orsay (2.1 million), mostly devoted to Impressionism, the Musée de l'Orangerie (1.02 million), which is home to eight large Water Lily murals by Claude Monet, as well as the Centre Georges Pompidou (1.2 million), dedicated to contemporary art. Disneyland Paris is Europe's most popular theme park, with 15 million combined visitors to the resort's Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park in 2009.[218] French Riviera With more than 10 millions tourists a year, the French Riviera (French: Côte d'Azur), in Southeast France, is the second leading tourist destination in the country, after the Paris region.[219] It benefits from 300 days of sunshine per year, 115 kilometres (71 mi) of coastline and beaches, 18 golf courses, 14 ski resorts and 3,000 restaurants.[220]:31 Each year the Côte d'Azur hosts 50% of the world's superyacht fleet.[220]:66 Châteaux With 6 millions tourists a year, the castles of the Loire Valley (French: châteaux) and the Loire Valley itself are the third leading tourist destination in France;[221][222] this World Heritage site is noteworthy for its architectural heritage, in its historic towns but in particular its castles, such as the Châteaux d'Amboise, de Chambord, d'Ussé, de Villandry, Chenonceau and Montsoreau. The Château de Chantilly, Versailles and Vaux-le-Vicomte, all three located near Paris, are also visitor attractions. Other protected areas France has 37 sites inscribed in UNESCO's World Heritage List and features cities of high cultural interest, beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, as well as rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity (green tourism). Small and picturesque French villages are promoted through the association Les Plus Beaux Villages de France (literally ""The Most Beautiful Villages of France""). The ""Remarkable Gardens"" label is a list of the over 200 gardens classified by the Ministry of Culture. This label is intended to protect and promote remarkable gardens and parks. France attracts many religious pilgrims on their way to St. James, or to Lourdes, a town in the Hautes-Pyrénées that hosts several million visitors a year. Energy Further information: Energy in France France derives most of its electricity from nuclear power, the highest percentage in the world. Photograph of the Belleville Nuclear Power Plant Électricité de France (EDF), the main electricity generation and distribution company in France, is also one of the world's largest producers of electricity. In 2018, it produced around 20% of the European Union's electricity,[223] primarily from nuclear power. France is the smallest emitter of carbon dioxide among the G8, due to its heavy investment in nuclear power.[224] As of 2016[update], 72% of the electricity produced by France is generated by 58 nuclear power plants.[225][226] In this context, renewable energies are having difficulty taking off. France also uses hydroelectric dams to produce electricity, such as the Eguzon dam, Étang de Soulcem and Lac de Vouglans. Transport Main article: Transport in France A TGV Duplex crossing the Cize–Bolozon viaduct. The train can reach a maximum speed of 360 kilometres per hour (220 mph). The railway network of France, which as of 2008[update] stretches 29,473 kilometres (18,314 mi)[227] is the second most extensive in Western Europe after that of Germany.[228] It is operated by the SNCF, and high-speed trains include the Thalys, the Eurostar and TGV, which travels at 320 km/h (199 mph) in commercial use.[229] The Eurostar, along with the Eurotunnel Shuttle, connects with the United Kingdom through the Channel Tunnel. Rail connections exist to all other neighboring countries in Europe, except Andorra. Intra-urban connections are also well developed with both underground services (Paris, Lyon, Lille, Marseille, Toulouse, Rennes) and tramway services (Nantes, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Grenoble, Montpellier...) complementing bus services. There are approximately 1,027,183 kilometres (638,262 mi) of serviceable roadway in France, ranking it the most extensive network of the European continent.[230] The Paris region is enveloped with the most dense network of roads and highways that connect it with virtually all parts of the country. French roads also handle substantial international traffic, connecting with cities in neighboring Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Andorra and Monaco. There is no annual registration fee or road tax; however, usage of the mostly privately owned motorways is through tolls except in the vicinity of large communes. The new car market is dominated by domestic brands such as Renault, Peugeot and Citroën.[231] France possesses the Millau Viaduct, the world's tallest bridge,[232] and has built many important bridges such as the Pont de Normandie. Diesel and gasoline fuelled cars and lorries cause a large part of the country's air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.[233][234] Air France is one of the biggest airlines in the world. There are 464 airports in France.[98] Charles de Gaulle Airport, located in the vicinity of Paris, is the largest and busiest airport in the country, handling the vast majority of popular and commercial traffic and connecting Paris with virtually all major cities across the world. Air France is the national carrier airline, although numerous private airline companies provide domestic and international travel services. There are ten major ports in France, the largest of which is in Marseille,[235] which also is the largest bordering the Mediterranean Sea.[236][237] 12,261 kilometres (7,619 mi) of waterways traverse France including the Canal du Midi, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean through the Garonne river.[98] Science and technology Main articles: Science and technology in France and List of French inventions and discoveries France is in 2020 the biggest national financial contributor to the European Space Agency,[238] which conceived the Ariane rocket family, launched from French Guiana (Ariane 5 pictured). Since the Middle Ages, France has been a major contributor to scientific and technological achievement. Around the beginning of the 11th century, Pope Sylvester II, born Gerbert d'Aurillac, reintroduced the abacus and armillary sphere, and introduced Arabic numerals and clocks to Northern and Western Europe.[239] The University of Paris, founded in the mid-12th century, is still one of the most important universities in the Western world.[240] In the 17th century, mathematician René Descartes defined a method for the acquisition of scientific knowledge, while Blaise Pascal became famous for his work on probability and fluid mechanics. They were both key figures of the Scientific Revolution, which blossomed in Europe during this period. The Academy of Sciences was founded by Louis XIV to encourage and protect the spirit of French scientific research. It was at the forefront of scientific developments in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. It is one of the earliest academies of sciences. The Age of Enlightenment was marked by the work of biologist Buffon and chemist Lavoisier, who discovered the role of oxygen in combustion, while Diderot and D'Alembert published the Encyclopédie, which aimed to give access to ""useful knowledge"" to the people, a knowledge that they can apply to their everyday life.[241] With the Industrial Revolution, the 19th century saw spectacular scientific developments in France with scientists such as Augustin Fresnel, founder of modern optics, Sadi Carnot who laid the foundations of thermodynamics, and Louis Pasteur, a pioneer of microbiology. Other eminent French scientists of the 19th century have their names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. Famous French scientists of the 20th century include the mathematician and physicist Henri Poincaré, physicists Henri Becquerel, Pierre and Marie Curie, who remained famous for their work on radioactivity, the physicist Paul Langevin and virologist Luc Montagnier, co-discoverer of HIV AIDS. Hand transplantation was developed on 23 September 1998 in Lyon by a team assembled from different countries around the world including Jean-Michel Dubernard who, shortly thereafter, performed the first successful double hand transplant.[242] Telesurgery was developed by Jacques Marescaux and his team on 7 September 2001 across the Atlantic Ocean (New-York-Strasbourg, Lindbergh Operation).[243] A face transplant was first done on 27 November 2005[244][245] by Dr. Bernard Devauchelle. The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble France was the fourth country to achieve nuclear capability[246] and has the third largest nuclear weapons arsenal in the world.[247] It is also a leader in civilian nuclear technology.[248][249][250] France was the third nation, after the former USSR and the United States, to launch its own space satellite and remains the biggest contributor to the European Space Agency (ESA).[251][252][253] The European Airbus, formed from the French group Aérospatiale along with DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG (DASA) and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA), designs and develops civil and military aircraft as well as communications systems, missiles, space rockets, helicopters, satellites, and related systems. France also hosts major international research instruments such as the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility or the Institut Laue–Langevin and remains a major member of CERN. It also owns Minatec, Europe's leading nanotechnology research center. The SNCF, the French national railroad company, has developed the TGV, a high speed train which holds a series of world speed records. The TGV has been the fastest wheeled train in commercial use since reaching a speed of 574.8 km/h (357.2 mph) on 3 April 2007.[254] Western Europe is now serviced by a network of TGV lines. The Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) has been ranked by the Nature Index 2020 as the fourth institution with highest share of articles published in scientific journals in the world.[255] France itself was the 6th nation globally with the highest share of articles published in scientific journals according to the Nature Index 2020, which is valid for the calendar year 2019.[256] As of 2018[update], 69 French people have been awarded a Nobel Prize[257] and 12 have received the Fields Medal.[258] Demographics Main articles: Demographics of France and French people Population density in France by arrondissement. The main urban areas are visible, notably the Paris (center-north), Lille (north), Marseille (southeast) and Lyon (center-southeast) urban areas. With an estimated May 2021 population of 67.413 million people,[259] France is the 20th most populous country in the world, the third-most populous in Europe (after Russia and Germany), and the second most populous in the European Union (after Germany). France is an outlier among developed countries, particularly in Europe, for its relatively high rate of natural population growth: By birth rates alone, it was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the European Union in 2006.[260] Between 2006 and 2016, France saw the second highest overall increase in population in the EU, and was one of only four EU countries where natural births accounted for most population growth.[261] This was the highest rate since the end of the baby boom in 1973, and coincides with the rise of the total fertility rate from a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010. As of January 2021[update], the fertility rate declined slightly to 1.84 children per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1, and considerably below the high of 4.41 in 1800.[262][263][264][265] France's fertility rate and crude birth rate nonetheless remain among the highest in the EU. However, like many developed nations, the French population is aging; the average age is 41.7 years, while about a fifth of French people are 65 or over.[266] Average life expectancy at birth is 82.7 years, the 12th highest in the world. From 2006 to 2011, population growth averaged 0.6 percent per year;[267] since 2011, annual growth has been between 0.4 and 0.5 percent annually.[268] Immigrants are major contributors to this trend; in 2010, 27 percent of newborns in metropolitan France had at least one foreign-born parent and another 24 percent had at least one parent born outside Europe (excluding French overseas territories).[269] Ethnic groups Most French people are of Celtic-Gallic origin, with a significant admixture of Italic (Romans) and Germanic (Franks) groups reflecting centuries of respective migration and settlement.[270] Through the course of the Middle Ages, France incorporated various neighboring ethnic and linguistic groups, as evidenced by Breton elements in the west, Aquitanian in the southwest, Scandinavian in the northwest, Alemannic in the northeast, and Ligurian in the southeast. Large-scale immigration over the last century and a half has led to a more multicultural society; beginning with the French Revolution, and further codified in the French Constitution of 1958, the government is prohibited from collecting data on ethnicity and ancestry; most demographic information is drawn from private sector organisations or academic institutions. In 2004, the Institut Montaigne estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were White (85% of the population), 6 million were Northwest African (10%), 2 million were Black (3.3%), and 1 million were Asian (1.7%).[271][272] A 2008 poll conducted jointly by INED and the French National Institute of Statistics[273][274] estimated that the largest ancestry groups were Italian (5 million), followed by Northwest African (3-6 million),[275][276][277] Sub-Saharan African (2.5 million), Armenian (500,000), and Turkish (200,000).[278] There are also sizable minorities of other European ethnic groups, namely Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, and Greek.[275][279][280] France has a significant Gitan (Romani) population, numbering between 20,000 and 400,000;[281] many foreign Roma are expelled back to Bulgaria and Romania frequently.[282] Immigration It is currently estimated that 40% of the French population is descended at least partially from the different waves of immigration since the early 20th century;[283] between 1921 and 1935 alone, about 1.1 million net immigrants came to France.[284] The next largest wave came in the 1960s, when around 1.6 million pieds noirs returned to France following the independence of its Northwest African possessions, Algeria and Morocco.[285][286] They were joined by numerous former colonial subjects from North and West Africa, as well as numerous European immigrants from Spain and Portugal. France remains a major destination for immigrants, accepting about 200,000 legal immigrants annually.[287] In 2005, it was Western Europe's leading recipient of asylum seekers, with an estimated 50,000 applications (albeit 15% decrease from 2004).[288] In 2010, France received about 48,100 asylum applications—placing it among the top five asylum recipients in the world[289] and in subsequent years it saw the number of applications increase, ultimately doubling to 100,412 in 2017.[290] The European Union allows free movement between the member states, although France established controls to curb Eastern European migration,[citation needed] and immigration remains a contentious political issue. In 2008, the INSEE (National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) estimated that the total number of foreign-born immigrants was around 5 million (8% of the population), while their French-born descendants numbered 6.5 million, or 11% of the population. Thus, nearly a fifth of the country's population were either first or second-generation immigrants, of which more than 5 million were of European origin and 4 million of Maghrebi ancestry.[291][292][293] In 2008, France granted citizenship to 137,000 persons, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and Turkey.[294] In 2014, an INSEE reported doubling of the number of Spanish immigrants, Portuguese and Italians in France between 2009 and 2012. According to the French Institute, this increase resulting from the financial crisis that hit several European countries in that period, has pushed up the number of Europeans installed in France.[295] Statistics on Spanish immigrants in France show a growth of 107 percent between 2009 and 2012, i.e. in this period went from 5,300 to 11,000 people.[295] Of the total of 229,000 foreigners who were in France in 2012, nearly 8% were Portuguese, 5% British, 5% Spanish, 4% Italians, 4% Germans, 3% Romanians, and 3% Belgians.[295] Major cities See also: Urban area (France) and Urban unit France is a highly urbanized country, with its largest cities (in terms of metropolitan area population in 2016[296]) being Paris (12,568,755 inh.), Lyon (2,310,850), Marseille (1,756,296), Toulouse (1,345,343), Bordeaux (1,232,550), Lille (1,187,824), Nice (1,006,402), Nantes (961,521), Strasbourg (785,839) and Rennes (727,357). (Note: There are significant differences between the metropolitan population figures just cited and those in the following table, which indicates the population of the communes).

Since 1635, the Académie française has been France's official authority on the French language, although its recommendations carry no legal weight. There are also regional languages spoken in France, such as Occitan, Breton, Catalan, Flemish (Dutch dialect), Alsatian (German dialect), Basque, and Corsican. Italian was the official language of Corsica until 9 May 1859.[298] The Government of France does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications. In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the European Union and globally through institutions such as the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. The perceived threat from anglicisation has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France. Besides French, there exist 77 vernacular minority languages of France, eight spoken in French metropolitan territory and 69 in the French overseas territories. From the 17th to the mid-20th century, French served as the pre-eminent international language of diplomacy and international affairs as well as a lingua franca among the educated classes of Europe.[299] The dominant position of French language in international affairs was overtaken by English, since the emergence of the United States as a major power.[59][300][301] For most of the time in which French served as an international lingua franca, it was not the native language of most Frenchmen: a report in 1794 conducted by Henri Grégoire found that of the country's 25 million people, only three million spoke French natively; the rest spoke one of the country's many regional languages, such as Alsatian, Breton or Occitan.[302] Through the expansion of public education, in which French was the sole language of instruction, as well as other factors such as increased urbanisation and the rise of mass communication, French gradually came to be adopted by virtually the entire population, a process not completed until the 20th century. As a result of France's extensive colonial ambitions between the 17th and 20th centuries, French was introduced to the Americas, Africa, Polynesia, South-East Asia, as well as the Caribbean. French is the second most studied foreign language in the world after English,[303] and is a lingua franca in some regions, notably in Africa. The legacy of French as a living language outside Europe is mixed: it is nearly extinct in some former French colonies (The Levant, South and Southeast Asia), while creoles and pidgins based on French have emerged in the French departments in the West Indies and the South Pacific (French Polynesia). On the other hand, many former French colonies have adopted French as an official language, and the total number of French speakers is increasing, especially in Africa. It is estimated that between 300 million[304] and 500 million[305] people worldwide can speak French, either as a mother tongue or a second language. According to the 2007 Adult Education survey, part of a project by the European Union and carried in France by the INSEE and based on a sample of 15,350 persons, French was the native language of 87.2% of the total population, or roughly 55.81 million people, followed by Arabic (3.6%, 2.3 million), Portuguese (1.5%, 960,000), Spanish (1.2%, 770,000) and Italian (1.0%, 640,000). Native speakers of other languages made up the remaining 5.2% of the population.[306] Religion Main article: Religion in France Notre-Dame de Reims is the Roman Catholic cathedral where the Kings of France were crowned until 1825.[XIV] France is a secular country in which freedom of religion is a constitutional right. French religious policy is based on the concept of laïcité, a strict separation of church and state under which public life is kept completely secular. According to a survey held in 2016 by Institut Montaigne and Institut français d'opinion publique (IFOP), 51.1% of the total population of France was Christian, 39.6% had no religion (atheism or agnosticism), 5.6% were Muslims, 2.5% were followers of other faiths, and the remaining 0.4% were undecided about their faith.[307] Estimates of the number of Muslims in France vary widely. In 2003, the French Ministry of the Interior estimated the total number of people of Muslim background to be between 5 and 6 million (8–10%).[308][309] The current Jewish community in France is the largest in Europe and the third-largest in the world after Israel and the United States, ranging between 480,000 and 600,000, about 0.8% of the population as of 2016.[307] Catholicism has been the predominant religion in France for more than a millennium, though it is not as actively practised today as it was. Among the 47,000 religious buildings in France, 94% are Roman Catholic.[310] During the French Revolution, activists conducted a brutal campaign of de-Christianisation, ending the Catholic Church as the state religion. In some cases clergy and churches were attacked, with iconoclasm stripping the churches of statues and ornaments. After alternating between royal and secular republican governments during the 19th century, in 1905 France passed the 1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, which established the principle of laïcité.[311] To this day, the government is prohibited from recognizing any specific right to a religious community (except for legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the local law in Alsace-Moselle). It recognizes religious organisations according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine. Conversely, religious organisations are expected to refrain from intervening in policy-making.[312] Certain groups, such as Scientology, Children of God, the Unification Church, and the Order of the Solar Temple are considered cults (""sectes"" in French), and therefore do not have the same status as recognized religions in France.[313] Secte is considered a pejorative term in France.[314] Health Main article: Health in France The Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, a teaching hospital in Paris, is one of Europe's largest hospitals.[315] The French health care system is one of universal health care largely financed by government national health insurance. In its 2000 assessment of world health care systems, the World Health Organization found that France provided the ""close to best overall health care"" in the world.[316] The French healthcare system was ranked first worldwide by the World Health Organization in 1997.[317][318] In 2011, France spent 11.6% of GDP on health care, or US$4,086 per capita,[319] a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in Europe but less than in the United States. Approximately 77% of health expenditures are covered by government funded agencies.[320] Care is generally free for people affected by chronic diseases (affections de longues durées) such as cancer, AIDS or cystic fibrosis. Average life expectancy at birth is 78 years for men and 85 years for women, one of the highest of the European Union and the World.[321][322] There are 3.22 physicians for every 1000 inhabitants in France,[323] and average health care spending per capita was US$4,719 in 2008.[324] As of 2007[update], approximately 140,000 inhabitants (0.4%) of France are living with HIV/AIDS.[98] Even if the French have the reputation of being one of the thinnest people in developed countries,[325][326][327][328][329] France—like other rich countries—faces an increasing and recent epidemic of obesity, due mostly to the replacement in French eating habits of traditional healthy French cuisine by junk food.[330][325][326][331] The French obesity rate is still far below that of the United States—currently equal to American rate in the 1970s—and is still the lowest of Europe.[326][328][331] Authorities now regard obesity as one of the main public health issues and fight it fiercely.[332] Rates of childhood obesity are slowing in France, while continuing to grow in other countries.[333] Education Main article: Education in France The École normale supérieure (ENS) in Paris, established in the end of the 18th century, produces more Nobel Prize laureates per capita than any other institution in the world.[334] In 1802, Napoleon created the lycée, the second and final stage of secondary education that prepares students for higher education studies or a profession.[335] Nevertheless, Jules Ferry is considered the father of the French modern school, leading reforms in the late 19th century that established free, secular, and compulsory education (currently mandatory until the age of 16).[336][337] French education is centralized and divided into three stages: Primary, secondary, and higher education. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranked France's education as below OECD average in 2018.[338] Primary and secondary education are predominantly public, run by the Ministry of National Education. While training and remuneration of teachers and the curriculum are the responsibility of the state centrally, the management of primary and secondary schools is overseen by local authorities. Primary education comprises two phases, nursery school (école maternelle) and elementary school (école élémentaire). Nursery school aims to stimulate the minds of very young children and promote their socialization and development of a basic grasp of language and number. Around the age of six, children transfer to elementary school, whose primary objectives are learning about writing, arithmetic and citizenship. Secondary education also consists of two phases. The first is delivered through colleges (collège) and leads to the national certificate (Diplôme national du brevet). The second is offered in high schools (lycée) and finishes in national exams leading to a baccalaureate (baccalauréat, available in professional, technical or general flavors) or certificate of professional competence (certificat d'aptitude professionelle). Higher education is divided between public universities and the prestigious and selective Grandes écoles, such as Sciences Po Paris for Political studies, HEC Paris for Economics, Polytechnique, the École des hautes études en sciences sociales for Social studies and the École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris that produce high-profile engineers, or the École nationale d'administration for careers in the Grands Corps of the state. The Grandes écoles have been criticized for alleged elitism, producing many if not most of France's high-ranking civil servants, CEOs, and politicians.[339] Culture Main article: Culture of France Eugène Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People (1830) portrays the July Revolution using the stylistic views of Romanticism. Since Liberty is part of the motto ""Liberté, égalité, fraternité"", as the French put it, this painting has become the primary symbol of the French Republic. France has been a centre of Western cultural development for centuries. Many French artists have been among the most renowned of their time; France is still recognised in the world for its rich cultural tradition.[340] The successive political regimes have always promoted artistic creation. The creation of the Ministry of Culture in 1959 helped preserve the cultural heritage of the country and make it available to the public. The Ministry of Culture has been very active since its creation, granting subsidies to artists, promoting French culture in the world, supporting festivals and cultural events, protecting historical monuments. The French government also succeeded in maintaining a cultural exception to defend audiovisual products made in the country.[341] France receives the highest number of tourists per year, largely thanks to the numerous cultural establishments and historical buildings implanted all over the territory. It counts 1,200 museums welcoming more than 50 million people annually.[342] The most important cultural sites are run by the government, for instance through the public agency Centre des monuments nationaux, which is responsible for approximately 85 national historical monuments. The 43,180 buildings protected as historical monuments include mainly residences (many castles) and religious buildings (cathedrals, basilicas, churches), but also statues, memorials and gardens. The UNESCO inscribed 45 sites in France on the World Heritage List.[343] Art Main article: French art The Louvre Museum, widely recognized as one of the finest art museums in the world, was in 2019 both the largest and the most-visited museum in the world.[344] The origins of French art were very much influenced by Flemish art and by Italian art at the time of the Renaissance. Jean Fouquet, the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance at first hand. The Renaissance painting School of Fontainebleau was directly inspired by Italian painters such as Primaticcio and Rosso Fiorentino, who both worked in France. Two of the most famous French artists of the time of Baroque era, Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain, lived in Italy. Claude Monet, founder of the Impressionist movement The 17th century was the period when French painting became prominent and individualised itself through classicism. Prime Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert founded in 1648 the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture under Louis XIV to protect these artists; in 1666 he also created the still-active French Academy in Rome to have direct relations with Italian artists. French artists developed the rococo style in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style, the works of the court-endorsed artists Antoine Watteau, François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as Napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as Jacques-Louis David and the highly influential Académie des Beaux-Arts defined the style known as Academism. At this time France had become a centre of artistic creation, the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements, at first Romanticism with Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix, then Realism with Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet, a style that eventually evolved into Naturalism. In the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting became even more important, with the development of new styles of painting such as Impressionism and Symbolism. The most famous impressionist painters of the period were Camille Pissarro, Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir.[345] The second generation of impressionist-style painters, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Georges Seurat, were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions,[346] as well as the fauvist artists Henri Matisse, André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck.[347][348] At the beginning of the 20th century, Cubism was developed by Georges Braque and the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, living in Paris. Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, such as Vincent van Gogh, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and Wassily Kandinsky. Le Penseur by Auguste Rodin (1902), Musée Rodin, Paris Many museums in France are entirely or partly devoted to sculptures and painting works. A huge collection of old masterpieces created before or during the 18th century are displayed in the state-owned Musée du Louvre, such as the Mona Lisa, also known as ""La Joconde"". While the Louvre Palace has been for a long time a museum, the Musée d'Orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station Gare d'Orsay, in a major reorganisation of national art collections, to gather French paintings from the second part of the 19th century (mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements).[349][350] The musée d'Orsay was voted in 2018 the best museum in the world.[351] Modern works are presented in the Musée National d'Art Moderne, which moved in 1976 to the Centre Georges Pompidou. These three state-owned museums welcome close to 17 million people a year.[352] Other national museums hosting paintings include the Grand Palais (1.3 million visitors in 2008), but there are also many museums owned by cities, the most visited being the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (0.8 million entries in 2008), which hosts contemporary works.[352] Outside Paris, all the large cities have a Museum of Fine Arts with a section dedicated to European and French painting. Some of the finest collections are in Lyon, Lille, Rouen, Dijon, Rennes and Grenoble. Architecture Main article: French architecture Saint Louis's Sainte-Chapelle represents the French impact on religious architecture. During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers. Some French castles that survived are Chinon, Château d'Angers, the massive Château de Vincennes and the so-called Cathar castles. During this era, France had been using Romanesque architecture like most of Western Europe. Some of the greatest examples of Romanesque churches in France are the Saint Sernin Basilica in Toulouse, the largest romanesque church in Europe,[353] and the remains of the Cluniac Abbey. The Gothic architecture, originally named Opus Francigenum meaning ""French work"",[354] was born in Île-de-France and was the first French style of architecture to be copied in all Europe.[355] Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic cathedrals and basilicas, the first of these being the Saint Denis Basilica (used as the royal necropolis); other important French Gothic cathedrals are Notre-Dame de Chartres and Notre-Dame d'Amiens. The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church: Notre-Dame de Reims.[356] Aside from churches, Gothic Architecture had been used for many religious palaces, the most important one being the Palais des Papes in Avignon. The final victory in the Hundred Years' War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture. It was the time of the French Renaissance and several artists from Italy were invited to the French court; many residential palaces were built in the Loire Valley, from 1450 with as a first reference the Château de Montsoreau.[357] Such residential castles were the Château de Chambord, the Château de Chenonceau, or the Château d'Amboise. Following the renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages, Baroque architecture replaced the traditional Gothic style. However, in France, baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one.[358] In the secular domain, the Palace of Versailles has many baroque features. Jules Hardouin Mansart, who designed the extensions to Versailles, was one of the most influential French architect of the baroque era; he is famous for his dome at Les Invalides.[359] Some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as the Place Stanislas in Nancy. On the military architectural side, Vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over Europe, the Americas, Russia and Turkey.[360][361] Place de la Bourse in Bordeaux, an example of French baroque architecture After the Revolution, the Republicans favoured Neoclassicism although it was introduced in France prior to the revolution with such buildings as the Parisian Pantheon or the Capitole de Toulouse. Built during the first French Empire, the Arc de Triomphe and Sainte Marie-Madeleine represent the best example of Empire style architecture.[362] Under Napoleon III, a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth; extravagant buildings such as the neo-baroque Palais Garnier were built. The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; for example, Haussmann's renovation of Paris. The architecture associated to this era is named Second Empire in English, the term being taken from the Second French Empire. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. In the late 19th century, Gustave Eiffel designed many bridges, such as Garabit viaduct, and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the iconic Eiffel Tower. The Capitole de Toulouse hosts Toulouse City Hall. In the 20th century, French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier designed several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The Louvre Pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 metres (121 ft).[363] France's largest financial district is La Defense, where a significant number of skyscrapers are located.[364] Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the Millau Viaduct. Some famous modern French architects include Jean Nouvel, Dominique Perrault, Christian de Portzamparc or Paul Andreu. Literature Main article: French literature The earliest French literature dates from the Middle Ages, when what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language. There were several languages and dialects, and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of French medieval texts are unknown, such as Tristan and Iseult and Lancelot-Grail. Other authors are known, for example Chrétien de Troyes and Duke William IX of Aquitaine, who wrote in Occitan. Much medieval French poetry and literature were inspired by the legends of the Matter of France, such as The Song of Roland and the various chansons de geste. The Roman de Renart, written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the medieval character Reynard ('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing. An important 16th-century writer was François Rabelais, whose novel Gargantua and Pantagruel has remained famous and appreciated until now. Michel de Montaigne was the other major figure of the French literature during that century. His most famous work, Essais, created the literary genre of the essay.[365] French poetry during that century was embodied by Pierre de Ronsard and Joachim du Bellay. Both writers founded the La Pléiade literary movement. During the 17th century, Madame de La Fayette published anonymously La Princesse de Clèves, a novel that is considered to be one of the first psychological novels of all time.[366] Jean de La Fontaine is one of the most famous fabulists of that time, as he wrote hundreds of fables, some being far more famous than others, such as The Ant and the Grasshopper. Generations of French pupils had to learn his fables, that were seen as helping teaching wisdom and common sense to the young people. Some of his verses have entered the popular language to become proverbs, such as ""À l'œuvre, on connaît l'artisan.""[A workman is known by his chips].[367] French literary figures. Clockwise from top left: Molière is the most played author in the Comédie-Française;[368] Victor Hugo is one of the most important French novelists and poets; 19th-century poet, writer and translator Charles Baudelaire; 20th-century philosopher and novelist Jean-Paul Sartre Jean Racine, whose incredible mastery of the alexandrine and of the French language has been praised for centuries, created plays such as Phèdre or Britannicus. He is, along with Pierre Corneille (Le Cid) and Molière, considered as one of the three great dramatists of France's golden age. Molière, who is deemed to be one of the greatest masters of comedy of the Western literature,[369] wrote dozens of plays, including Le Misanthrope, L'Avare, Le Malade imaginaire, as well as Le Bourgeois gentilhomme. His plays have been so popular around the world that French language is sometimes dubbed as ""the language of Molière"" (la langue de Molière),[370] just like English is considered as ""the language of Shakespeare"". French literature and poetry flourished even more in the 18th and 19th centuries. Denis Diderot's best-known works are Jacques the Fatalist and Rameau's Nephew. He is however best known for being the main redactor of the Encyclopédie, whose aim was to sum up all the knowledge of his century (in fields such as arts, sciences, languages, and philosophy) and to present them to the people, to fight ignorance and obscurantism. During that same century, Charles Perrault was a prolific writer of famous children's fairy tales including Puss in Boots, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Bluebeard. At the start of the 19th century, symbolist poetry was an important movement in French literature, with poets such as Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé.[371] The 19th century saw the writings of many renowned French authors. Victor Hugo is sometimes seen as ""the greatest French writer of all time""[372] for excelling in all literary genres. The preface of his play Cromwell is considered to be the manifesto of the Romantic movement. Les Contemplations and La Légende des siècles are considered as ""poetic masterpieces"",[373] Hugo's verse having been compared to that of Shakespeare, Dante and Homer.[373] His novel Les Misérables is widely seen as one of the greatest novel ever written[374] and The Hunchback of Notre Dame has remained immensely popular. Other major authors of that century include Alexandre Dumas (The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte-Cristo), Jules Verne (Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea), Émile Zola (Les Rougon-Macquart), Honoré de Balzac (La Comédie humaine), Guy de Maupassant, Théophile Gautier and Stendhal (The Red and the Black, The Charterhouse of Parma), whose works are among the most well known in France and the world. The Prix Goncourt is a French literary prize first awarded in 1903.[375] Important writers of the 20th century include Marcel Proust, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Antoine de Saint Exupéry wrote Little Prince, which has remained popular for decades with children and adults around the world.[376] As of 2014[update], French authors had more Literature Nobel Prizes than those of any other nation.[377] The first Nobel Prize in Literature was a French author, while France's latest Nobel prize in literature is Patrick Modiano, who was awarded the prize in 2014.[377] Jean-Paul Sartre was also the first nominee in the committee's history to refuse the prize in 1964.[377] Philosophy Main article: French philosophy Medieval philosophy was dominated by Scholasticism until the emergence of Humanism in the Renaissance. Modern philosophy began in France in the 17th century with the philosophy of René Descartes, Blaise Pascal and Nicolas Malebranche. Descartes was the first Western philosopher since ancient times to attempt to build a philosophical system from the ground up rather than building on the work of predecessors.""[378][379] His Meditations on First Philosophy changed the primary object of philosophical thought and raised some of the most fundamental problems for foreigners such as Spinoza, Leibniz, Hume, Berkeley, and Kant. René Descartes, founder of modern Western philosophy[380] French philosophers produced some of the most important political works of the Age of Enlightenment. In The Spirit of the Laws, Baron de Montesquieu theorised the principle of separation of powers, which has been implemented in all liberal democracies since it was first applied in the United States. Voltaire came to embody the Enlightenment with his defence of civil liberties, such as the right to a free trial and freedom of religion. 19th-century French thought was targeted at responding to the social malaise following the French Revolution. Rationalist philosophers such as Victor Cousin and Auguste Comte, who called for a new social doctrine, were opposed by reactionary thinkers such as Joseph de Maistre, Louis de Bonald and Félicité Robert de Lamennais, who blamed the rationalist rejection of traditional order. De Maistre, together with the Englishman Edmund Burke, was one of the founders of European conservatism. Comte was the founder of positivism, which Émile Durkheim reformulated as a basis for social research. In the 20th century, partly as a reaction to the perceived excesses of positivism, French spiritualism thrived with thinkers such as Henri Bergson and it influenced American pragmatism and Whitehead's version of process philosophy. Meanwhile, French epistemology became a prominent school of thought with Jules Henri Poincaré, Gaston Bachelard, Jean Cavaillès and Jules Vuillemin. Influenced by German phenomenology and existentialism, the philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre gained a strong influence after World War II, and late-20th-century-France became the cradle of postmodern philosophy with Jean-François Lyotard, Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault. Music Main article: Music of France Claude Debussy France has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed a number of talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include Marc-Antoine Charpentier, François Couperin, Michel-Richard Delalande, Jean-Baptiste Lully and Marin Marais, all of them composers at the court. After the death of the ""Roi Soleil"", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer of French opera and the leading French composer for the harpsichord.[381][full citation needed] French composers played an important role during the music of the 19th and early 20th century, which is considered to be the Romantic music era. Romantic music emphasised a surrender to nature, a fascination with the past and the supernatural, the exploration of unusual, strange and surprising sounds, and a focus on national identity. This period was also a golden age for operas. French composers from the Romantic era included: Hector Berlioz (best known for his Symphonie fantastique), Georges Bizet (best known for Carmen, which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas), Gabriel Fauré (best known for his Pavane, Requiem, and nocturnes), Charles Gounod (best known for his Ave Maria and his opera Faust), Jacques Offenbach (best known for his 100 operettas of the 1850s–1870s and his uncompleted opera The Tales of Hoffmann), Édouard Lalo (best known for his Symphonie espagnole for violin and orchestra and his Cello Concerto in D minor), Jules Massenet (best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty, the most frequently staged are Manon (1884) and Werther (1892)) and Camille Saint-Saëns (he has many frequently-performed works, including The Carnival of the Animals, Danse macabre, Samson and Delilah (Opera), Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and his Symphony No. 3). Later came precursors of modern classical music. Érik Satie was a key member of the early-20th-century Parisian avant-garde, best known for his Gymnopédies. Francis Poulenc's best known works are his piano suite Trois mouvements perpétuels (1919), the ballet Les biches (1923), the Concert champêtre (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera Dialogues des Carmélites (1957) and the Gloria (1959) for soprano, choir and orchestra. Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy are the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed.[382] Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of atonality. The two composers invented new musical forms[383][384][385][386] and new sounds. Ravel's piano compositions, such as Jeux d'eau, Miroirs, Le tombeau de Couperin and Gaspard de la nuit, demand considerable virtuosity. His mastery of orchestration is evident in the Rapsodie espagnole, Daphnis et Chloé, his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and his orchestral work Boléro (1928). More recently, the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Ohana, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Boulez contributed to the evolutions of contemporary classical music.[387] Serge Gainsbourg, one of the world's most influential popular musicians French music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music at the middle of the 20th century. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, French pop music, known as chanson française, has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are Édith Piaf, Georges Brassens, Léo Ferré, Charles Aznavour and Serge Gainsbourg.[388] Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries,[389] bands such as Noir Désir, Mano Negra, Niagara, Les Rita Mitsouko and more recently Superbus, Phoenix and Gojira,[390] or Shaka Ponk, have reached worldwide popularity. Daft Punk, pioneers of the French house movement Other French artists with international careers have been popular in several countries, most notably female singers Dalida, Mireille Mathieu, Mylène Farmer,[390] Alizée and Nolwenn Leroy,[391] electronic music pioneers Jean-Michel Jarre, Laurent Garnier and Bob Sinclar, later Martin Solveig and David Guetta. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), electronic duos Daft Punk, Justice and Air also reached worldwide popularity and contributed to the reputation of modern electronic music in the world.[390][392][393] Among current musical events and institutions in France, many are dedicated to classical music and operas. The most prestigious institutions are the state-owned Paris National Opera (with its two sites Palais Garnier and Opéra Bastille), the Opéra National de Lyon, the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, the Théâtre du Capitole in Toulouse and the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux. As for music festivals, there are several events organised, the most popular being Eurockéennes (a word play which sounds in French as ""European""), Solidays and Rock en Seine. The Fête de la Musique, imitated by many foreign cities, was first launched by the French Government in 1982.[394][395] Major music halls and venues in France include Le Zénith sites present in many cities and other places in Paris (Paris Olympia, Théâtre Mogador, Élysée Montmartre). Cinema Main article: Cinema of France A Palme d'Or from the Cannes Film Festival, one of the ""Big Three"" film festivals alongside the Venice Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival[396][397][398] Louis de Funès, often called ""France's favourite actor"", has played over 130 roles in film and over 100 on stage.[399] France has historical and strong links with cinema, with two Frenchmen, Auguste and Louis Lumière (known as the Lumière Brothers) credited with creating cinema in 1895.[400] The world's first female filmmaker, Alice Guy-Blaché, was also from France.[401] Several important cinematic movements, including the late 1950s and 1960s Nouvelle Vague, began in the country. It is noted for having a strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by the Government of France. France remains a leader in filmmaking, as of 2015[update] producing more films than any other European country.[402][403] The nation also hosts the Cannes Festival, one of the most important and famous film festivals in the world.[404][405] Apart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as Poland (Roman Polanski, Krzysztof Kieślowski, Andrzej Żuławski), Argentina (Gaspar Noé, Edgardo Cozarinsky), Russia (Alexandre Alexeieff, Anatole Litvak), Austria (Michael Haneke) and Georgia (Géla Babluani, Otar Iosseliani) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as Luc Besson, Jacques Tourneur or Francis Veber in the United States. Although the French film market is dominated by Hollywood, France is the only nation in the world where American films make up the smallest share of total film revenues, at 50%, compared with 77% in Germany and 69% in Japan.[406] French films account for 35% of the total film revenues of France, which is the highest percentage of national film revenues in the developed world outside the United States, compared to 14% in Spain and 8% in the UK.[406] France is in 2013 the 2nd exporter of films in the world after the United States.[407] France historically was the cultural center of the world,[299] although its dominant position has been surpassed by the United States. Today, France takes steps in protecting and promoting its culture, becoming a leading advocate of the cultural exception.[408] The nation succeeded in convincing all EU members to refuse to include culture and audiovisuals in the list of liberalised sectors of the WTO in 1993.[409] Moreover, this decision was confirmed in a voting in the UNESCO in 2005: the principle of ""cultural exception"" won an overwhelming victory with 198 countries voting for it and only 2 countries, the United States and Israel, voting against.[410] Fashion Main article: French fashion Chanel's headquarters on the Place Vendôme, Paris Fashion has been an important industry and cultural export of France since the 17th century, and modern ""haute couture"" originated in Paris in the 1860s. Today, Paris, along with London, Milan, and New York City, is considered one of the world's fashion capitals, and the city is home or headquarters to many of the premier fashion houses. The expression Haute couture is, in France, a legally protected name, guaranteeing certain quality standards. The association of France with fashion and style (French: la mode) dates largely to the reign of Louis XIV[411] when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. But France renewed its dominance of the high fashion (French: couture or haute couture) industry in the years 1860–1960 through the establishing of the great couturier houses such as Chanel, Dior, and Givenchy. The French perfume industry is world leader in its sector and is centered on the town of Grasse.[412] In the 1960s, the elitist ""Haute couture"" came under criticism from France's youth culture. In 1966, the designer Yves Saint Laurent broke with established Haute Couture norms by launching a prêt-à-porter (""ready to wear"") line and expanding French fashion into mass manufacturing. With a greater focus on marketing and manufacturing, new trends were established by Sonia Rykiel, Thierry Mugler, Claude Montana, Jean-Paul Gaultier and Christian Lacroix in the 1970s and 1980s. The 1990s saw a conglomeration of many French couture houses under luxury giants and multinationals such as LVMH. According to 2017 data compiled by Deloitte, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LVMH), a French brand, is the largest luxury company in the world by sales, selling more than twice the amount of its nearest competitor.[413] Moreover, France also possesses 3 of the top 10 luxury goods companies by sales (LVMH, Kering SA, L'Oréal), more than any other country in the world.[413] Media Main article: Telecommunications in France The Parisian headquarters of Agence France-Presse, one of the world's oldest and leading news agencies[414] Best-selling daily national newspapers in France are Le Parisien Aujourd'hui en France (with 460,000 sold daily), Le Monde and Le Figaro, with around 300,000 copies sold daily, but also L'Équipe, dedicated to sports coverage.[415] In the past years, free dailies made a breakthrough, with Metro, 20 Minutes and Direct Plus distributed at more than 650,000 copies respectively.[416] However, the widest circulations are reached by regional daily Ouest France with more than 750,000 copies sold, and the 50 other regional papers have also high sales.[417][418] The sector of weekly magazines is stronger and diversified with more than 400 specialized weekly magazines published in the country.[419] The most influential news magazines are the left-wing Le Nouvel Observateur, centrist L'Express and right-wing Le Point (more than 400.000 copies),[420] but the highest circulation for weeklies is reached by TV magazines and by women's magazines, among them Marie Claire and ELLE, which have foreign versions. Influential weeklies also include investigative and satirical papers Le Canard Enchaîné and Charlie Hebdo, as well as Paris Match. Like in most industrialized nations, the print media have been affected by a severe crisis in the past decade. In 2008, the government launched a major initiative to help the sector reform and become financially independent,[421][422] but in 2009 it had to give 600,000 euros to help the print media cope with the economic crisis, in addition to existing subsidies.[423] Le Figaro was founded in 1826; many of France's most prominent authors have written in its columns over the decades, and it is still considered a newspaper of record.[424] In 1974, after years of centralised monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agency ORTF was split into several national institutions, but the three already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations[425][426] remained under state-control. It was only in 1981 that the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory, ending state monopoly on radio.[426] French television was partly liberalized in the next two-decade with the creation of several commercial channels, mainly thanks to cable and satellite television. In 2005 the national service Télévision Numérique Terrestre introduced digital television all over the territory, allowing the creation of other channels. The four existing national channels are owned by state-owned consortium France Télévisions, funded by advertising revenue and TV licence fees. Public broadcasting group Radio France run five national radio stations. Among these public media are Radio France Internationale, which broadcasts programs in French all over the world, and Franco-German TV channel TV5 Monde. In 2006, the government created global news channel France 24. Long-established TV channels TF1 (privatized in 1987), France 2 and France 3 have the highest shares, while radio stations RTL, Europe 1 and state-owned France Inter are the least listened to. Society See also: Human rights in France and LGBT rights in France Sculpture of Marianne, a common national personification of the French Republic According to a BBC poll in 2010, based on 29,977 responses in 28 countries, France is globally seen as a positive influence in the world's affairs: 49% have a positive view of the country's influence, whereas 19% have a negative view.[427][428] The Nation Brand Index of 2008 suggested that France has the second best international reputation, only behind Germany.[429] A global opinion poll for the BBC saw France ranked the fourth most positively viewed nation in the world (behind Germany, Canada and the United Kingdom) in 2014.[430] According to a poll in 2011, the French were found to have the highest level of religious tolerance and to be the country where the highest proportion of the population defines its identity primarily in term of nationality and not religion.[431] As of 2011[update], 75% of French had a favourable view of the United States, making France one of the most pro-American countries in the world.[432] As of 2017[update], the favourable view of the United States had dropped to 46%.[433] In January 2010, the magazine International Living ranked France as ""best country to live in"", ahead of 193 other countries, for the fifth year running.[434] The OECD Better Life Index states that ""France performs well in many measures of well-being relative to most other countries in the Better Life Index.""[435] The French Revolution continues to permeate the country's collective memory. The tricolour flag of France,[436] the anthem ""La Marseillaise"", and the motto Liberté, égalité, fraternité, defined in Title 1 of the Constitution as national symbols, all emerged during the cultural ferment of the early revolution, along with Marianne, a common national personification. In addition, Bastille Day, the national holiday, commemorates the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789.[437] A common and traditional symbol of the French people is the Gallic rooster. Its origins date back to Antiquity, since the Latin word Gallus meant both ""rooster"" and ""inhabitant of Gaul"". Then this figure gradually became the most widely shared representation of the French, used by French monarchs, then by the Revolution and under the successive republican regimes as representation of the national identity, used for some stamps and coins.[438] French flags displayed on the Champs Elysées after France's victory at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The French Tricolore is enshrined in the French Constitution as the national emblem of the French Republic.[439] France is one of the world leaders of gender equality in the workplace: as of 2017, it has 36.8% of its corporate board seats held by women, which makes it the leader of the G20 for that metric;[440] and was ranked in 2019 by the World Bank as one of the only 6 countries in the world where women have the same work rights as men.[441] France is one of the most liberal countries in the world when it comes to LGBT rights: a 2020 Pew Research Center poll found that 86% of the French think that same-sex relationships should be accepted by society, one of the highest acceptance rates in the world (comparable to that of other Western European nations).[442] France legalized same-sex marriage and adoption in 2013.[443] The government has used its diplomatic clout to support LGBT rights throughout the world, notably in the United Nations.[444] In 2020, France was ranked 5th in the Environmental Performance Index (behind the United Kingdom), out of 180 countries ranked by Yale University in that study.[445] Being the host country of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference, the French government was instrumental in securing the 2015 Paris agreement, a success that has been credited to its ""openness and experience in diplomacy"".[446] Cuisine Main article: French cuisine French wines are usually made to accompany French cuisine. French cuisine is renowned for being one of the finest in the world.[447][448] According to the regions, traditional recipes are different, the North of the country prefers to use butter as the preferred fat for cooking, whereas olive oil is more commonly used in the South.[449] Moreover, each region of France has iconic traditional specialties: Cassoulet in the Southwest, Choucroute in Alsace, Quiche in the Lorraine region, Beef bourguignon in the Bourgogne, provençal Tapenade, etc. France's most renowned products are wines,[450] including Champagne, Bordeaux, Bourgogne, and Beaujolais as well as a large variety of different cheeses, such as Camembert, Roquefort and Brie. There are more than 400 different varieties.[451][452] A meal often consists of three courses, hors d'œuvre or entrée (introductory course, sometimes soup), plat principal (main course), fromage (cheese course) or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Hors d'œuvres could include terrine de saumon au basilic, lobster bisque, foie gras, French onion soup or a croque monsieur. The plat principal could include a pot au feu or steak frites. The dessert could be mille-feuille pastry, a macaron, an éclair, crème brûlée, mousse au chocolat, crêpes, or Café liégeois. Some French cheeses with fruits French cuisine is also regarded as a key element of the quality of life and the attractiveness of France.[434] A French publication, the Michelin guide, awards Michelin stars for excellence to a select few establishments.[453][454] The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on the success of a restaurant. By 2006, the Michelin Guide had awarded 620 stars to French restaurants, at that time more than any other country, although the guide also inspects more restaurants in France than in any other country (by 2010, Japan was awarded as many Michelin stars as France, despite having half the number of Michelin inspectors working there).[455][456] In addition to its wine tradition, France is also a major producer of beer and rum. The three main French brewing regions are Alsace (60% of national production), Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Lorraine. France produces rum via distilleries located on islands such as Reunion Island in the southern Indian Ocean. Sports Main article: Sport in France Starting in 1903, the Tour de France is the oldest and most prestigious of Grands Tours, and the world's most famous cycling race.[457] France hosts ""the world's biggest annual sporting event"", the Tour de France,[458] and other popular sports played in France include: football, judo, tennis,[459] rugby union[460] and pétanque. France has hosted events such as the 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups,[461] the 2007 Rugby World Cup,[462] and will host the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The country also hosted the 1960 European Nations' Cup, UEFA Euro 1984, UEFA Euro 2016 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. The Stade de France in Saint-Denis is France's largest stadium and was the venue for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2007 Rugby World Cup finals. Since 1903, France is famous for its 24 Hours of Le Mans sports car endurance race.[463] Several major tennis tournaments take place in France, including the Paris Masters and the French Open, one of the four Grand Slam tournaments. French martial arts include Savate and Fencing. Pierre de Coubertin, father of the modern Olympic Games France has a close association with the Modern Olympic Games; it was a French aristocrat, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who suggested the Games' revival, at the end of the 19th century.[464][465] After Athens was awarded the first Games, in reference to the Olympics' Greek origins, Paris hosted the second Games in 1900.[466] Paris was the first home of the International Olympic Committee, before it moved to Lausanne.[467] Since 1900, France has hosted the Olympics on 4 further occasions: the 1924 Summer Olympics, again in Paris[465] and three Winter Games (1924 in Chamonix, 1968 in Grenoble and 1992 in Albertville).[465] Similar to the Olympics, France introduced Olympics for the deaf people (Deaflympics) in 1924 with the idea of a French deaf car mechanic, Eugène Rubens-Alcais who paved the way to organise the inaugural edition of the Summer Deaflympics in Paris.[468] Both the national football team and the national rugby union team are nicknamed ""Les Bleus"" in reference to the team's shirt colour as well as the national French tricolour flag. Football is the most popular sport in France, with over 1,800,000 registered players, and over 18,000 registered clubs.[469] The football team is among the most successful in the world, with two FIFA World Cup victories in 1998 and 2018,[470] one FIFA World Cup second place in 2006,[471] and two UEFA European Championships in 1984[472] and 2000.[473] Zinedine Zidane was named the best European footballer of the past 50 years in a 2004 UEFA poll.[474] The top national football club competition is Ligue 1. France has produced some of the greatest players in the world, including three time FIFA World Player of the Year Zinedine Zidane, three time Ballon d'Or recipient Michel Platini, record holder for most goals scored at a World Cup Just Fontaine, first football player to receive the Légion d'honneur Raymond Kopa, and the record goalscorer for the French national team Thierry Henry.[475] The French Open, also called Roland-Garros, is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks between late May and early June at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris. It is the premier clay court tennis championship event in the world and the second of four annual Grand Slam tournaments.[476] Rugby union is popular, particularly in Paris and the southwest of France.[477] The national rugby union team has competed at every Rugby World Cup, and takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship.

"Research institute - Wikipedia Research institute From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Research Institute) Jump to navigation Jump to search Establishment endowed for doing research A research institute, research centre, or research center is an establishment founded for doing research. Research institutes may specialize in basic research or may be oriented to applied research. Although the term often implies natural science research, there are also many research institutes in the social science as well, especially for sociological and historical research purposes. Contents 1 Famous research institutes 2 Research institutes in Europe 3 Scientific research in twentieth century America 3.1 1900–1939 3.2 1940 onward 4 Notable research centres 5 See also 6 Footnotes Famous research institutes[edit] In the early medieval period, several astronomical observatories were built in the Islamic world. The first of these was the 9th-century Baghdad observatory built during the time of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun, though the most famous were the 13th-century Maragheh observatory, and the 15th-century Ulugh Beg Observatory.[1] The Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics was a school of mathematics and astronomy founded by Madhava of Sangamagrama in Kerala, India. The school flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries and the original discoveries of the school seems to have ended with Narayana Bhattathiri (1559–1632). In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently discovered a number of important mathematical concepts. The earliest research institute in Europe was Tycho Brahe's Uraniborg complex on the island of Hven, a 16th-century astronomical laboratory set up to make highly accurate measurements of the stars. In the United States there are numerous notable research institutes including Bell Labs, Xerox Parc, The Scripps Research Institute,[2] Beckman Institute, and SRI International. Hughes Aircraft used a research institute structure for its organizational model.[3] Thomas Edison, dubbed ""The Wizard of Menlo Park"",[4] was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention in the late 1800s, and because of that, he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.[5] Research institutes in Europe[edit] From the throes of the Scientific Revolution came the 17th century scientific academy. In London, the Royal Society was founded in 1660, and in France Louis XIV founded the Académie royale des sciences in 1666 which came after private academic assemblies had been created earlier in the seventeenth century to foster research. . In the early 18th century Peter the Great established an educational-research institute to be built in his newly created imperial capital, St Petersburg. His plan combined provisions for linguistic, philosophical and scientific instruction with a separate academy in which graduates could pursue further scientific research. It was the first institution of its kind in Europe to conduct scientific research within the structure of a university. The St Petersburg Academy was established by decree on 28 January 1724.[6] The Lammi Biological Research Center in Hämeenlinna, Finland At the European level, there are now several government-funded institutions such as the European Space Agency (ESA), the nuclear research centre CERN, the European Southern Observatory ESO (Grenoble), the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) (Grenoble), the EUMETSAT facility, the Italian -European Sistema Trieste with, among others, the International Centre for Theoretical Physics and the research complex Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste, the biology project EMBL, and the fusion projects ITER and Wendelstein 7-X, which in addition to technical developments have a strong research focus. Scientific research in twentieth century America[edit] See also: Research I university Research institutes came to emerge at the beginning of the twentieth century. In 1900, at least in Europe and the United States, the scientific profession had only evolved so far as to include the theoretical implications of science and not its application. Research scientists had yet to establish a leadership in expertise. Outside scientific circles it was generally assumed that a person in an occupation related to the sciences carried out work which was necessarily ""scientific"" and that the skill of the scientist did not hold any more merit than the skill of a labourer. A philosophical position on science was not thought by all researchers to be intellectually superior to applied methods. However any research on scientific application was limited by comparison. A loose definition attributed all naturally occurring phenomena to ""science"". The growth of scientific study stimulated a desire to reinvigorate the scientific discipline by robust research in order to extract ""pure"" science from such broad categorisation.[7] 1900–1939[edit] This began with research conducted autonomously away from public utility and governmental supervision. Enclaves for industrial investigations became established. These included the Rockefeller Institute, Carnegie Institution of Washington and the Institute for Advanced Study. Research was advanced in both theory and application. This was aided by substantial private donation.[7] 1940 onward[edit] As of 2006, there were over 14,000 research centres in the United States.[8] The expansion of universities into the faculty of research fed into these developments as mass education produced mass scientific communities. A growing public consciousness of scientific research brought public perception to the fore in driving specific research developments. After the Second World War and the atom bomb specific research threads were followed: environmental pollution and national defence.[7] Notable research centres[edit] Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics Ames Research Center Bell Labs Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering Marine Sciences Research Center Palo Alto Research Center Thomas J.

WWE Studios released the film on DVD in 2012.[2] WWE Studios was formed in 2002 as WWE Films,[3] and was seen as ""a natural extension of the entertainment business"" that they already featured in the weekly Raw and SmackDown television programs.[4] Joel Simon was named as President of the WWE Films and Jed Blaugrund as vice president.[3][5] WWE announced the first three film projects in January 2005; The Condemned, starring Steve Austin, The Marine, starring John Cena, and Goodnight, later retitled as See No Evil, starring Kane.[6][7] It was in 2008 that the name was changed to WWE Studios.[8][9] In February 2009, WWE Studios announced the first film which would not feature a WWE wrestler as the lead, with That's What I Am starring Ed Harris as a schoolteacher accused of fondling kids.[10] In December 2009, it was announced that Patricia Clarkson and Danny Glover would star in the WWE Studios and Samuel Goldwyn Films co-production of Legendary along with WWE wrestler John Cena.[11][12] Around the same time, the film announced production had been completed on another co-production with Samuel Goldwyn Films, the comedy Knucklehead, which starred WWE wrestler Big Show.[13][14] Further projects were announced in 2010 with WWE wrestlers in lead roles, with The Chaperone starring Triple H,[15][16] which was released in February 2011,[17] and Bending the Rules starring Edge,[18][19] which was released in March 2012.[20][21] These initial releases were largely unsuccessful financially.[22] In February 2012, WWE Studios agreed to a new three-film deal with 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment to produce, finance and market three straight-to-DVD titles,[23] including The Marine 3: Homefront starring The Miz, having previously worked with 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on the previous films in the franchise, The Marine and The Marine 2. The deal also included the release of 12 Rounds 2: Reloaded starring Randy Orton, having together previously released 12 Rounds starring John Cena.[24] In April 2012, WWE Studios partnered with Warner Bros. Entertainment France and producer Thomas Langmann to distribute French film Les Reines Du Ring in the United States and Canada,[25][26] as well as the rights to remake the film, which was announced in 2014.[27][28] WWE Studios also produced No One Lives with Pathe Pictures, starring Luke Evans and WWE wrestler Brodus Clay, and acquired the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival cult hit The Day, starring Shawn Ashmore and Dominic Monaghan. WWE Studios has also acquired Interrogation, a suspense thriller by Adam Rodin.[29] WWE Studios then secured the rights to Bermuda, a found footage horror spec script by Bobby Lee Darby and Nathan Brookes, set in the Bermuda Triangle.[30] WWE Studios further announced a partnership with producer Edward R. Pressman and Jason Blum's Blum-Hanson-Allen films to develop Cruisin' for a Brusin', an action comedy to be written and directed by Adam Bhala Lough.[31] WWE Studios and Warner Bros. co-produced a Scooby-Doo animated feature that found Scooby and the gang solving a mystery at WrestleMania, which also starred an ensemble of WWE Superstars. The movie released on March 25, 2014.[32] On May 29, 2013, it was announced that WWE studios and Warner Bros would again team up to co-produce a Flintstones animated movie to be released in early 2015.[33] WWE Studios most successful film to date is the 2013 release The Call, starring Halle Berry and Abigail Breslin, which made close to $70 million at the box office,[34] despite a comparatively small budget of just $13m.[35][36] The film opened at the US box office at #2 with 17 million in its first weekend.[34] It was further reported that WWE was looking at a potential sequel following the success of The Call.[37] In 2013, WWE Studios and Hyde Park Entertainment announced a deal to work together on the film adaptation of the 1980s television series The Fall Guy. The film will star Dwayne Johnson, who made his name as The Rock in WWE from 1996–2004 before becoming an actor, in his second WWE Studios production, with the first being The Scorpion King.[38][39][40][41] In August 2014, a second collaboration between WWE Studios and Hyde Park was announced, with Ken Jeong, David Hasselhoff and WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan signed to star in a comedy Killing Hasselhoff.[42][43] In February 2014, WWE announced the sequel to the 1996 film Jingle All the Way, to star Larry the Cable Guy and WWE wrestler Santino Marella.[44][45] In May 2014, it was announced that WWE had extended their partnership with Lionsgate Entertainment to release a further six films together,[46][47] with the first two announced as Vendetta, starring The Big Show[48] and 12 Rounds 3: Lockdown starring Dean Ambrose.[49][50] These group of six films have been referred as the Action Six-Pack Series.[51] In November 2014, WWE announced a new partnership deal with Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.[52] And in the turn of the year, WWE had announced two new partnership deals. In March 2015, they announced a partnership with newly founded Gene Simmons production company Erebus Pictures and[53] in April 2015, WWE Studios teamed with British company Richwater Films to co-produce and co-finance action-thrillers Eliminators and Rampage.[54] In November 2017, WWE announced that WWE Studios will expand its mandate to include scripted, non-scripted, family, and animated television and digital content.[55] In February 2019, it was reported that WWE Studios and Netflix came to an agreement that would see WWE Studios produce new family-friendly movies for Netflix's platform.[56] In July 2019, it was announced that WWE Studios will be producing its first television show, Fight Like A Girl, for Quibi.[57] In March 2021, the Game Show Network revealed at their upfront; they signed a deal with WWE Studios to develop shows hosted by WWE talent.[58] Filmography[edit] Film[edit] Year Title US Release Date WWE Superstar(s) Featured Distributor Notes 2003 The Rundown September 26, 2003 The Rock Universal Pictures First theatrical film released as WWE Films 2004 Walking Tall April 2, 2004 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer 2006 See No Evil May 19, 2006 Kane Lionsgate The Marine October 13, 2006 John Cena 20th Century Fox 2007 The Condemned April 27, 2007 Steve Austin Lionsgate Last theatrical film released as WWE Films 2008 Behind Enemy Lines: Colombia September 19, 2008 Mr. Kennedy 20th Century Fox Straight-to-video 2009 12 Rounds March 27, 2009 John Cena First theatrical film released as WWE Studios The Marine 2 June 19, 2009 Ted DiBiase Jr. Straight-to-video 2010 Legendary September 10, 2010 John Cena Samuel Goldwyn Films Knucklehead October 22, 2010 Big Show 2011 The Chaperone February 18, 2011 Triple H That's What I Am April 29, 2011 Randy Orton Inside Out September 9, 2011 Triple H The Reunion October 21, 2011 John Cena 2012 Bending the Rules March 9, 2012 Edge WWE Studios The Day August 29, 2012 Anchor Bay FilmsWWE Studios Distribution only Barricade April 20, 2012 WWE Studios The Marine 3: Homefront November 14, 2012 The Miz 20th Century Fox 2013 Dead Man Down March 8, 2013 Wade Barrett FilmDistrict The Call March 15, 2013 David Otunga TriStar Pictures No One Lives May 10, 2013 Brodus Clay Anchor Bay Films Queens of the Ring (Les reines du ring) July 3, 2013 (France) July 25, 2014 (US) Various cameos1 Image Entertainment Theatrical Film (US) 12 Rounds 2: Reloaded March 1, 2013 Randy Orton 20th Century Fox Christmas Bounty August 16, 2013 The Miz Warner Bros.

(2002–present)FormerlyCapitol Wrestling CorporationWorld Wide Wrestling FederationWorld Wrestling Federation The history of WWE dates back to the early 1950s when it was founded in 1953 as Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC). It underwent several name changes throughout the years, from World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in 1963 to World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979, and finally to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2002, with the latter being strictly abbreviated to WWE in 2011. WWE is the largest professional wrestling promotion in the world. It has promoted some of the most successful wrestlers and storylines, and featured some of the most iconic and significant matches and moments in the history of sports entertainment. WWE currently airs several high-profile programs such as Raw and SmackDown in more than 150 countries, hosts at least 12 pay-per-view events a year including WrestleMania, and holds approximately 320 live events a year throughout the world. In 2014, WWE launched the first 24/7 streaming network which would eventually showcase the entire WWE video library.[1] Contents 1 Capitol Wrestling Corporation 1.1 Early years (1953–1963) 2 World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) 2.1 Rise of Bruno Sammartino (1963–1980) 3 World Wrestling Federation 3.1 Transition (1979–1982) 3.2 Golden Era (1982–1993) 3.3 New Generation Era (1993–1997) 3.4 Attitude Era (1997–2002) 3.4.1 The Alliance Invasion and the nWo (2001–2002) 4 World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE 4.1 Ruthless Aggression Era (2002–2008) 4.1.1 Money in the Bank (2005) 4.1.2 Return of ECW (2006–2010) 4.2 PG Era (2008–2014) 4.2.1 Launch of NXT (2010) 4.3 Reality Era (2014–2016) 4.4 New Era (2016–present) 4.4.1 Move to Peacock (2021) 5 Other 5.1 WWE Online 5.2 Death of Owen Hart 5.3 Legends program and the WWE Hall of Fame 5.4 Death of Eddie Guerrero 5.5 Chris Benoit's double-murder and suicide 5.6 Social media and WWE HD 5.7 WWE Network 5.8 Pink Ribbon campaigning 5.9 Backstage harassment 5.10 Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2021) 6 See also 7 References 8 External links Capitol Wrestling Corporation[edit] Early years (1953–1963)[edit] WWE's origins can be traced back as far as the 1950s when on January 7, 1953 the first show under the Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC) was produced. There is uncertainty as to who the founder of the CWC was. Some sources state that it was Vincent J. McMahon[2][3][4] while other sources cite McMahon's father Jess McMahon (who died in 1954) as founder of CWC.[5][6][7] The NWA recognized an undisputed NWA World Heavyweight Champion that went to several different professional wrestling promotions in the NWA. The championship was defended around the world. The NWA generally promoted strong shooters as champions, to give their worked sport credibility and guard against double-crosses. While doing strong business in the Midwest (the NWA's core region), these wrestlers attracted little interest in the CWC territory. In 1961, the NWA board decided instead to put the championship on bleach blond showman ""Nature Boy"" Buddy Rogers, a much more effective drawing card in the region.[8] The rest of the NWA was unhappy with McMahon and Toots Mondt (who joined the CWC in the early 1960s) because he rarely allowed Rogers to wrestle outside of the Northeast. Mondt and McMahon wanted Rogers to keep the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, but Rogers was unwilling to sacrifice his $25,000 deposit on the championship belt (championship holders at the time had to pay a deposit to insure they honored their commitments as champion). Rogers lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship to Lou Thesz in a one-fall match in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on January 24, 1963, which led to Mondt, McMahon, and the CWC leaving the NWA in protest, creating the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in the process.[9][10] World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF)[edit] Rise of Bruno Sammartino (1963–1980)[edit] The official WWWF logo from 1963 to 1979 The World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) was formed on January 24, 1963. On April 25, 1963, Buddy Rogers was awarded the new WWWF World Heavyweight Championship, supposedly winning an apocryphal tournament in Rio de Janeiro. He lost the championship to Bruno Sammartino a month later on May 17, 1963, after suffering a heart attack shortly before the match. To accommodate Rogers' condition, the match was booked to last under a minute.[11] Bruno Sammartino (right) is the all-time longest-reigning WWWF World Heavyweight Champion and one of the most prolific wrestlers in the sport André the Giant (middle right), King Kong Bundy (center), Hillbilly Jim (right turnbuckle), and Big John Studd (middle corner) in a 1985 match at Madison Square Garden. Sammartino would retain the title for seven years, eight months and one day (2,803 days), making his the longest continuous world championship reign in men's wrestling history. Although Sammartino was the face of the WWWF, wrestlers such as Superstar Billy Graham and Bob Backlund were also hugely popular.[12][citation needed] The WWWF gained notoriety in the 1970s by holding their biggest shows at Shea Stadium or Madison Square Garden and doing strong business across the entire Northeast megalopolis. They leveraged former, but still popular, wrestlers such as Captain Lou Albano, ""Grand Wizard of Wrestling"" Ernie Roth and ""Classy"" Freddie Blassie to act as managers for Sammartino's heel (villainous) opponents. At this time, only babyface (fan favorite) wrestlers were allowed to have long championship reigns, such as Bruno Sammartino, Pedro Morales and Bob Backlund, who all retained for more than one year each. The heel champions, such as Ivan Koloff and Stan Stasiak, were used to ""transition"" the championship from one wrestler to another, and they generally kept the title for no more than a single month-long program before dropping it to the next babyface. Graham was the only heel character to keep his championship for longer than one month, as the WWWF felt it needed time to build Backlund up as championship material.[13] The WWWF was relatively conservative for promotions of its day; running its major arenas monthly rather than weekly or bi-weekly.[14] Programs generally involved a babyface champion facing a heel challenger for one to three meetings in each scheduled town; for longer programs the heel would often win the first match in a non-decisive manner such as a countout or via excessive blood loss, and the champion would then retain in an ultraviolent blow-off match such as a steel cage match or Texas Death match.[15] Unlike most of the NWA territories, the main event would occur in the middle of the arena show cards, allowing the company to build upon the match's finish in order to sell tickets to the next event; reliable, popular workers such as Chief Jay Strongbow would then wrestle at the end of the show to send the crowd home happy.[16][17] The WWWF also featured popular wrestlers based out of non-WWWF territories such as Dusty Rhodes and retained the services of (at the time) the most popular and highly paid wrestler in the world, André the Giant, in between his territorial and international obligations. WWWF held their then major event Showdown at Shea three times at Flushing, New York's Shea Stadium in 1972, 1976 and 1980. Bruno Sammartino main evented the 1972 and 1980 events, in 1972 wrestling Pedro Morales to a 75 minutes time limit draw and in 1980 defeating Larry Zbyszko in a Steel cage match. The main event of the 1976 event was a Boxer vs Wrestler fight between Muhammad Ali and Antonio Inoki which ended in a draw. At that event Sammartino had retained the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship against Stan Hansen. The 1972, 1976 and 1980 events each had attendance figures of 22,508, 32,000 and 36,295 respectively.[18][19][20] Toots Mondt left the WWWF in the late sixties, and Vincent J. McMahon assumed complete control of the organization in 1971.[21] Later that year, The Mongols created controversy after they left the WWWF with the WWWF International Tag Team Championship. The championship would be considered inactive as a result until Luke Graham and Tarzan Tyler won a tournament to claim the championship. They then defeated the Mongols in November 1971, voiding any claim The Mongols had to the championship. In March 1979, for marketing purposes, the World Wide Wrestling Federation was renamed as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).[22] World Wrestling Federation[edit] Transition (1979–1982)[edit] In 1980, Vincent K. McMahon, the son of Vincent J. McMahon, founded Titan Sports, Inc. and applied trademarks for the initials ""WWF"". Golden Era (1982–1993)[edit] Main article: 1980s professional wrestling boom Vince McMahon, the owner of WWE In 1982, McMahon purchased Capitol Sports, the parent company of the WWF, from his father and associates Gorilla Monsoon and Arnold Skaaland.[23] Seeking to make the WWF the premier wrestling promotion in the world, he began an expansion process that fundamentally changed the industry.[24] In an interview with Sports Illustrated, McMahon noted: In the old days, there were wrestling fiefdoms all over the country, each with its own little lord in charge. Each little lord respected the rights of his neighboring little lord. No takeovers or raids were allowed. There were maybe 30 of these tiny kingdoms in the U.S. and if I hadn't bought out my dad, there would still be 30 of them, fragmented and struggling. I, of course, had no allegiance to those little lords.[24] Upon taking over the company, McMahon immediately worked to get WWF programming on syndicated television all across the United States. This angered other promoters and disrupted the well-established boundaries of the different wrestling promotions. In addition, the company used income generated by advertising, television deals, and tape sales to secure talent from rival promoters. Capitol Sports already controlled most of the northeastern territory, but the younger McMahon wanted the WWF to be a national wrestling promotion; something the NWA did not approve of. He shortly defected his promotion from the NWA, much like the American Wrestling Association, which controlled the U.S. Northern Midwest. To become a national promotion, the WWF would have to become bigger than AWA or any NWA promotion. McMahon's vision for his promotion was starting to become possible when he signed AWA talent Hulk Hogan, who had achieved popularity outside of wrestling – notably for his appearance in Rocky III as Thunderlips.[25] McMahon signed Rowdy Roddy Piper as Hogan's rival, and shortly afterward signed Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura. Other significant wrestlers who were part of the roster included: Big John Studd, André the Giant, Jimmy ""Superfly"" Snuka, ""The Magnificent"" Don Muraco, Junkyard Dog, ""Mr. Wonderful"" Paul Orndorff, Greg ""The Hammer"" Valentine, Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, and Nikolai Volkoff. In 1984, Hogan was pushed to main event status. He defeated WWF World Heavyweight Champion The Iron Sheik at Madison Square Garden on January 23, 1984 and thus evolved into one of the most recognizable and popular faces in professional wrestling.[26] Hulk Hogan (left), Sergeant Slaughter (centre) and Brutus Beefcake (right) were mainstays of 1980's WWF wrestling With reasonable revenue being made, McMahon was able to secure television deals, and WWF was being shown across the United States.[citation needed] McMahon also began selling videotapes of WWF events outside the Northeast through his Coliseum Video distribution company, again angering other promoters.[citation needed] The syndication of WWF programming forced promotions to engage in direct competition with the WWF.[citation needed] The increased revenue allowed McMahon to sign more talent, such as Brutus Beefcake, Tito Santana, Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, Butch Reed, and ""Hacksaw"" Jim Duggan. However, for McMahon to truly turn WWF into a national promotion, he needed to have WWF touring the entire United States.[citation needed] Such a venture was impossible with the revenue WWF currently had, so McMahon envisioned a way to obtain the necessary capital through a risky all-or-nothing gamble on a supercard concept called WrestleMania in 1985. WrestleMania would be a pay-per-view extravaganza, viewable on closed-circuit television and marketed as the Super Bowl of professional wrestling. WrestleMania was not the first supercard seen in professional wrestling, as the NWA had previously run Starrcade in 1983. However, McMahon's vision was to make WWF and the industry itself mainstream, targeting more of the general television audience by exploiting the entertainment side of the industry. With the inaugural WrestleMania, WWF initiated a joint-promotional campaign with MTV, which featured a great deal of WWF coverage and programming, in what was termed the Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection. The mainstream media attention brought on by celebrities including Muhammad Ali, Mr. T and Cyndi Lauper at the event helped propel WrestleMania to become a staple in popular culture, and the use of celebrities has been a staple of the company to the present day. With the success of WrestleMania, other promotions which tried hard to keep the regional territory system alive started to merge under Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP).[citation needed] Starrcade and The Great American Bash were the JCP versions of WrestleMania, but even when operating inside of its territory, JCP had trouble matching the success of WWF.[citation needed] After Ted Turner purchased majority of JCP's assets, the promotion would become World Championship Wrestling (WCW), providing WWF with a competitor until 2001, when WCW and its trademarks were purchased by WWF.[citation needed] WrestleMania would become an annual pay-per-view phenomenon, being broadcast in nearly 150 countries and in almost 20 different languages.[citation needed] Perhaps the peak of the 1980s wrestling boom was WrestleMania III at the Pontiac Silverdome,[citation needed] which set an attendance record of 93,173. In the main event Hulk Hogan retained the WWF Championship against André the Giant.[27] McMahon used the success of WrestleMania to create more annual pay-per-views such as SummerSlam, the Royal Rumble and the Survivor Series, the latter two both receiving their names from unique stipulation matches featured at the event. These four shows would be jointly known as the “Big Four” of the company’s programming up until modern day. McMahon's focus on entertainment rather than giving his product a legitimate sports feel, the policy that became the concept of sports entertainment, led to great financial success for WWF.[citation needed] During the 1980s, Hulk Hogan would cross over into mainstream prominence presented as an all-American hero.[citation needed] Hogan's time as the face of the WWF would last until he departed from the company in the summer of 1993. Other stars such as ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage, ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper, The Ultimate Warrior, The Honky Tonk Man, ""Million Dollar Man"" Ted DiBiase, and others also helped make WWF a financial success in this time period.[citation needed] Jim Duggan won the first Royal Rumble match in 1988. While these talents were recognizable as individuals, some talent became better known for their teamwork as part of tag teams. Stables or groups such as Demolition, Strike Force, The Hart Foundation, The British Bulldogs, The Rockers and The Fabulous Rougeaus helped create a strong tag team division for WWF.[citation needed] Towards the end of the ""Golden Age"", Bret Hart of the Hart Foundation began to break out on his own as a singles competitor, with his most memorable match early on taking place at SummerSlam in 1992 against ""The British Bulldog"" Davey Boy Smith. Hart would eventually capture the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Ric Flair later that year and would win the King of the Ring tournament the following year. New Generation Era (1993–1997)[edit] Logo and tagline used for the New Generation Era from 1995–1997 Bret Hart was by far the biggest star at this point and defeated Yokozuna to win back the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in the main event of WrestleMania 10. In 1991, it was reported that Hulk Hogan, Roddy Piper, Rick Martel, Brian Blair, and Dan Spivey were to testify that they had purchased steroids from WWF physician Dr. George T. Zahorian, who was being charged with the illegal distribution of the drug.[28] Two years later, Vince McMahon was indicted due to his connection to Zahorian,[29] and faced a possible eight-year prison term and a $500,000 fine if convicted.[30] The trial began on July 7, 1994, with the prosecutor, who promised to expose ""the dark, corrupt underbelly"" of WWF, claimed McMahon distributed steroids ""like candy"" and pressured wrestlers into taking the drug.[31] Wrestler Nailz testified that McMahon had once said to him: ""I strongly suggest you go on the gas"".[32] Days later, Hogan admitted that steroid use amongst WWF wrestlers was common, but denied ever being pressured into doing so by McMahon.[33] A week later, McMahon was acquitted of all charges, and was quoted as saying ""I'm elated. Just like in wrestling, in the end the good guys always win.""[34] With business down in 1992 because of bad press from the steroid scandal, Vince McMahon began pushing younger talents into the spotlight over the next several years. By mid-1993, Bret ""Hit Man"" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Razor Ramon, Diesel, Lex Luger, Yokozuna, Owen Hart, Crush, Tatanka and others all became the stars of what the WWF eventually branded as the ""New Generation"".[citation needed] Hulk Hogan would leave the company in the summer of 1993 and Hart would become one of the most popular stars of this period until his departure in 1997.[citation needed] Meanwhile, competition between the major wrestling companies increased. In January 1993, WWF created their prime time cable TV program Monday Night Raw, which aired on the USA Network. In 1994, WCW signed Hulk Hogan and other former WWF stars to multi-year contracts, and in 1995 launched Monday Nitro on TNT, to go head to head with Raw, starting the Monday Night Wars.[35] At WrestleMania X in 1994 a ladder match between Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon received critical acclaim and was said to be ground breaking and to have revolutionized the concept of ladder matches.[36][37] By mid-1996, with the introduction of the New World Order (nWo), a stable led by former WWF wrestlers Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall (Razor Ramon), and Kevin Nash (Diesel), Nitro started a near two years of ratings domination.[citation needed] More talent would eventually leave WWF for WCW including Ted DiBiase, Curt Hennig, reigning WWF Women's Champion Alundra Blayze and The 1-2-3 Kid while Bret Hart decided to stay with the WWF in spite of a lucrative offer by WCW.[citation needed] At Badd Blood: In Your House in 1997 the first Hell in a Cell match would be held between The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels, which Michaels won after interference from Undertaker's storyline half brother Kane. The Hell in a Cell match has since become one of the most popular gimmick matches in wrestling history.[38] Attitude Era (1997–2002)[edit] Main article: Attitude Era Logo used from November 1997 – May 2002 In 1997, Vince McMahon responded to WCW's big success by taking the WWF in a different direction with more realistic characters and edgier storylines. Rising stars included the D-Generation X group (consisting of Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Rick Rude, X-Pac, Road Dogg, Billy Gunn and Chyna) and Stone Cold Steve Austin, whose rise to popularity began with his 1996 King of the Ring win and famous ""Austin 3:16"" speech. Despite starting out as a villain, Austin's popularity would start to gradually exceed those of the top fan favorites in the promotion.[citation needed] At Survivor Series on November 9, 1997, WWF debuted the ""scratch"" logo which would be the company's signature throughout the Attitude Era and on December 15, 1997, Vince McMahon aired a promo on Raw Is War addressing the audience on the company embarking on a ""more innovative and contemporary campaign"", which would advise parent discretion for a younger audience. This same episode also marked the beginning of the scratch logo being officially used for WWF television broadcasts and went into full effect, replacing the New Generation logo. In 1997, McMahon also informed Bret Hart that he could not longer afford to pay him what his contract stated, and suggested that he go back to the more lucrative deal that WCW had offered him.[citation needed] Hart signed with WCW, but a behind-the-scenes controversy developed over Hart's final matches, resulting in the Montreal Screwjob. Hart was defending the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Shawn Michaels at 1997 Survivor Series, when McMahon ordered the referee to award the match and the championship to Michaels as if Hart had submitted.[citation needed] While Hart went on to WCW, McMahon received enormous backlash from the media, wrestlers and fans alike, inspiring him to create the Mr. McMahon character, a villainous extension of his status as a promoter.[citation needed] Following Hart's departure, the company implemented a heavy push of popular anti-hero character Stone Cold Steve Austin, whose popularity was rising and was similar to Hulk Hogan's popularity in the 1980s. During an angle involving Mike Tyson at WrestleMania XIV in March 1998, Austin became WWF Champion by beating Shawn Michaels, giving rise to the Austin era and the despotic Mr. McMahon character, which began a long-lasting feud with Austin; this feud would be very important in the WWF turning the tides in the ratings war with rival company WCW. Later in the year, new talent began to emerge for WWF: The Rock, Triple H, Mick Foley, and Kane strengthened WWF's singles division, while stables such as D-Generation X and the Nation of Domination helped the fight against rival company WCW. WWF head writer Vince Russo also contributed to the formation of D-Generation X in 1997, The Undertaker vs. Kane feud in 1998, the Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Mr. McMahon feud, the rise of The Rock, and Mick Foley's three face pushes during the Attitude Era, which helped put Raw ahead of Nitro in the ratings.[39][40] Russo's booking style was often referred to as ""Crash TV,"" which included edgy, controversial storylines involving sexual content, profanity, swerves or unexpected heel turns, and worked shoots in the storylines. As well as short matches, backstage vignettes, shocking angles and levels of depicted violence.[40] Stone Cold Steve Austin is often called one of the most popular stars in WWE history WWF rebounded in its ratings and popularity, with Raw Is War finally beating Nitro for the first time in 84 weeks on April 13, 1998. Ratings would continue to rise through 1998 and 1999; a 12-minute match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and the Undertaker drew a 9.5 rating on June 28, 1999. It currently stands as the highest-rated segment in Raw history.[41] The Rock's popularity was fueled by his charisma and speaking abilities, which led to many catchphrases and merchandising opportunities The Attitude Era saw WWF expand its television coverage and its business structure, as well. During the summer of 1999, WWF's parent company, Titan Sports, was renamed World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. (WWFE, Inc. or WWFE), and on October 19, 1999 became a publicly-traded company, offering 10 million shares priced at $17 each,[42] and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in October 2000.[43] In 1999, WWF launched a secondary program known as SmackDown! on the UPN network to compete with WCW's Thunder. SmackDown!'s pilot debuted as a special on April 29, 1999. Beginning on August 26, 1999, the WWF program was aired weekly. In 2000, WWF, in collaboration with television network NBC, created XFL, a new professional football league. XFL, however, was a failure, having only lasted a single year before closing its doors.[citation needed] Head writer Chris Kreski replaced Vince Russo and Ed Ferrara, who defected to WCW in 1999.[44] Kreski's work was admired for well-planned and detailed storylines, and the transitional period saw feuds and storylines such as the Triple H/Cactus Jack feud, the Triple H/Kurt Angle/Stephanie McMahon love triangle, and a highly successful feud between The Hardy Boyz, Edge and Christian, and The Dudley Boyz.[44] At Survivor Series, WWF's top star, Stone Cold Steve Austin, was run over by a car at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan to write him off of television due to a serious neck injury. At SummerSlam in 2000, WWF debuted the highly popular Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, the inaugural match seeing Edge and Christian defeating The Dudley Boyz and The Hardy Boyz for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Prior to WrestleMania 2000, the McMahon family had gone into an on-screen rivalry with each other for the first time, setting up the ""McMahon in Every Corner"" four-way elimination main event between Big Show (managed by Shane McMahon), The Rock (managed by Mr. McMahon), Triple H (managed by Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley), and future WWF Commissioner Mick Foley (managed by Linda McMahon). Triple H won after Mr. McMahon turned on The Rock and thus retained the WWF Championship.[45] This was historically significant as the first time a heel wrestler had won the main event of Wrestlemania. Stone Cold Steve Austin would make his return to the company at Unforgiven 2000 and then would make his in-ring return at No Mercy, to gain revenge on Rikishi, who had been revealed as the driver of limousine that had struck Austin at Survivor Series. Austin would go on to win the next year's Royal Rumble match and come out victorious against The Rock for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania X-Seven with help from his former rival, Mr. McMahon, turning into a villain in the process.[46] At this point WWF won the Monday Night Wars against WCW. The Alliance Invasion and the nWo (2001–2002)[edit] Main articles: The Invasion (professional wrestling) and New World Order (professional wrestling) Kevin Nash was a key member of nWo In the Invasion storyline, Shane McMahon (kayfabe) acquired World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in April 2001 and WCW personnel invaded WWF. For the first time since the Monday Night Wars, WWF's purchase of WCW had made a major American inter-promotional feud possible, but the Invasion turned out to be a disappointment to many fans. One main reason would be that many of WCW's big-name stars were still under contract to WCW's old parent company, AOL Time Warner, rather than WCW itself, and their contracts were not included in the purchase of the company. These wrestlers chose to sit out the duration of their contracts and be financially supported by AOL Time Warner rather than work for WWF for a cheaper salary. On July 9, 2001, the stars of WCW and Extreme Championship Wrestling (acquired by Stephanie McMahon in a related storyline) joined forces, forming ""The Alliance"" with WCW owner Shane McMahon and the new owner of ECW Stephanie McMahon leading the charge, with the support and influence of original ECW owner Paul Heyman. At Invasion, Stone Cold Steve Austin turned on WWF and helped the Alliance win the Inaugural Brawl.[47] At Survivor Series, WWF finally defeated WCW and ECW in a ""Winner Takes All Match"" and the angle was concluded. In the aftermath of the Invasion angle, WWF made several major changes to their product. Ric Flair returned to the WWF as ""co-owner"" of the company, feuding with Vince McMahon. Jerry Lawler returned to the company after a nine-month hiatus, after his replacement on commentary, Paul Heyman, was fired on-screen by Vince McMahon. Several former Alliance stars were absorbed into the regular WWF roster, such as Booker T, The Hurricane, Lance Storm, and Rob Van Dam. At Vengeance 2001, Chris Jericho went on to unify the WCW Championship and WWF Championship, beating both The Rock and Steve Austin on the same night.[48] Eventually, Vince McMahon brought back Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall to reunite the nWo at the No Way Out pay-per-view in February 2002. However, Hogan proved to be too popular with nostalgic fans of the Golden Era's ""Hulkamania"" and soon turned face at WrestleMania X8 after his classic match with The Rock, which The Rock won. On the edition of March 25, 2002 of Raw, the World Wrestling Federation had the first time ever WWF draft lottery, which meant the WWF superstars are separated between two brands, Raw and SmackDown!. This became effective from April 1, 2002 on Raw, thus leading to a brand new era, and ending the Attitude Era. World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE[edit] The official WWE logo from May 06, 2002, to August 17, 2014 In 2002, the World Wrestling Federation lost a lawsuit initiated by the World Wildlife Fund over the WWF trademark.[49] World Wrestling Federation was forced to rebrand itself, and on May 6, 2002, the company changed its business name to World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. (WWE). Shortly thereafter, they eliminated all elements that used the term Federation; this affected licensed merchandise such as action figures, video games, and home video releases with its previous logo, which was replaced by a new ""scratch"" logo.[citation needed] The last-ever WWF-branded pay-per-view event was the UK-exclusive Insurrextion on May 4, 2002.[citation needed] During this time, the company launched WWE Studios, which was originally formed as WWE Films.[50] Ruthless Aggression Era (2002–2008)[edit] Main article: WWE brand extension The Undertaker (pictured here in March 2008) has been a highly popular figure in WWE since 1990, holding an undefeated WrestleMania streak until 2014. By April 2002, with an excess of talent employed as a result of having purchased WCW and ECW, WWE needed a way to provide exposure for all of its talent. This problem was solved by introducing a ""Brand Extension"", with the roster split in half and the talent assigned to either Raw or SmackDown! in a mock draft lottery. Wrestlers, commentators and referees became show-exclusive, and the shows were given separate on-screen General Managers. The brand extension came into effect on April 1, 2002. Shortly thereafter, on the June 24, 2002 episode of Raw, Vince McMahon officially referred to the new era as ""Ruthless Aggression"".[51] Later in 2002, after WWE Champion Brock Lesnar announced himself exclusive property of the SmackDown! brand and with the creation of the World Heavyweight Championship, all the championships became show-exclusive too. Additionally, both Raw and SmackDown! began to stage individual pay-per-view events featuring only performers from that brand – only the major four pay-per-views Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Survivor Series remained dual-branded.[citation needed] The practice of single-brand pay-per-view events was abandoned following WrestleMania 23.[52] In effect, Raw and SmackDown were operated as two distinct promotions, with a draft lottery taking place each year to determine which talent was assigned to each brand. This lasted until August 2011, when the rosters were merged and the Brand Extension was quietly phased out.[53] After the company transitioned into its Ruthless Aggression era, this period still featured many elements of its predecessor the Attitude Era, including the levels of violence, sex, and profanity, but there was less politically incorrect content, and a further emphasis on wrestling was showcased.[54] The two top stars of the Attitude Era, Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock, eventually left the company in 2003 and 2004 respectively, while newcomers such as Brock Lesnar, who would become the youngest WWE Champion and Randy Orton, who became the youngest World Heavyweight Champion, saw huge success. Triple H would also be featured prominently during this time, winning several of his fourteen world championships, as would The Undertaker, whose WrestleMania win streak started gaining fame. Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio, Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, Edge, Brock Lesnar, Randy Orton, John Cena, Batista, John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield, and Rob Van Dam were also given main event opportunities and all ended up becoming multiple-time world champions. From mid 2002 to 2003, WWE brought several prominent WCW stars to the company, including Eric Bischoff, Scott Steiner, Goldberg, Kevin Nash and Ric Flair. The Great American Bash, originally a WCW pay-per-view event, made its debut in WWE. Triple H was a very prominent superstar during this period, main-eventing WrestleMania 20, WrestleMania 21 and WrestleMania 22, respectively. He led the prominent villainous stable Evolution. He has since won 14 world championships. In August 2002, Shawn Michaels would also return as a wrestler at SummerSlam after a hiatus of over four years. He would achieve great success, and won a World Championship in the first Elimination Chamber match at Survivor Series. The match between Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle at WrestleMania 21 has been named one of the greatest matches in WWE history. Though Angle won the match, Michaels received praise for his ""courageous effort"".[55] In 2006, Michaels would reunite with Triple H to once again form the popular 1990s group D-Generation X. They would have major feuds with The Spirit Squad, the McMahon family, and the newly established Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton), which ended prematurely when Triple H suffered a torn quadriceps muscle in 2007.[56] Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio, the two most successful Mexican wrestlers in WWE history, and a popular tag team, as WWE Tag Team Champions in 2005. Eddie Guerrero, from the famous Mexican Guerrero wrestling family, achieved huge stardom during this period. He gained a large fanbase in 2003 on SmackDown!, which lead to a rapid increase in his popularity, promoting him to main event status, and he ultimately won his first world championship, the WWE Championship, at No Way Out in 2004, defeating Brock Lesnar in a highly-acclaimed match. He remained the top wrestler of the company after winning the WWE title until his untimely death on November 13, 2005. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame the following year. Guerrero's death due to his drug addictions caused WWE to implement the WWE Wellness Policy to prevent wrestlers from taking drugs. The circumstances of his death would provide a medium for his on- and off-screen friend Rey Mysterio to emerge as a major main-eventer and win the 2006 Royal Rumble match and the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22. Mysterio had begun a rivalry with the villainous nephew of Eddie, Chavo Guerrero Jr., who had cost him the World title during a match with Booker T. During the feud Mysterio injured his knees[57] and would be sidelined for the rest of 2006 and most of 2007, halting his main event push. Mysterio returned and defeated Chavo in the 2007 edition of SummerSlam and remained a popular fan-favorite wrestler.[58] John Cena was one of the biggest breakout stars of the Ruthless Aggression era. Upon his debut, Cena quickly proved popular due to his ""Doctor of Thuganomics"" white rapper gimmick on the SmackDown brand, receiving a WWE Championship match against Brock Lesnar in the spring at Backlash in 2003, and had a major feud with The Undertaker during the summer. At WrestleMania 21, he won his first world championship when he defeated John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield, the WWE Champion at that time. Cena's popularity soared when he was drafted to Raw, where he quickly became the face of WWE, a rise not seen since Austin and Hulk Hogan. Cena's popularity has led to him becoming the all-time record ""wish maker"" for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, granting over 500 wishes as of August 2017.[59] Cena secured victories over veterans Triple H and Shawn Michaels in the main events of WrestleMania 22 and WrestleMania 23, respectively. A popular wrestler during the period was Bobby Lashley from the ECW brand. Cena would defeat Lashley at The Great American Bash in 2007 in a well-received match, shortly after which Lashley left the WWE. After being sidelined due to a shoulder injury for the latter half of 2007, Cena returned in the 2008 Royal Rumble match, winning the match. John Cena was by far the biggest star to emerge during the Ruthless Aggression Era. Triple H, Randy Orton, Ric Flair, and Batista were part of the villainous stable Evolution, who were prominently featured between 2003-2005 until their eventual break-up.[60] Beginning in early 2005, the popularity of Batista would soar much like Cena's, winning the 2005 Royal Rumble and the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 21 from Triple H. Later in 2005, Batista would go on to defeat Triple H in a highly-acclaimed Hell in a Cell match at Vengeance.[61] Although Batista would have major success in the months following his championship win, he would suffer an injury in early 2006 and miss that year's WrestleMania. After returning and eventually winning another world championship, at WrestleMania 23 in 2007, Batista would defend the title against The Undertaker in a classic encounter, though he lost the match. However, Batista defeated The Undertaker at Cyber Sunday. Cena and Batista would not face each other for the first time until SummerSlam in 2008, with Batista winning. Randy Orton became a prominent Superstar during this period, becoming the youngest world champion in WWE history at the age of 24, defeating Chris Benoit at the 2004 SummerSlam event. Dubbed ""the Legend Killer,"" he would go on to have feuds with legendary superstars such as The Undertaker and Hulk Hogan, facing them at WrestleMania 21 and the 2006 SummerSlam event, respectively. Along with fellow Superstar Edge, he would form the villainous tag team Rated-RKO and find success in the tag team division. After returning to singles competition Orton became a multi-time WWE Champion. In 2007 Orton begun the famous Cena–Orton rivalry, which lasted till on and off 2014.[62] Orton would also be involved in a lengthy rivalry with former Evolution leader Triple H, defeating him in a Last Man Standing match at No Mercy in 2007 but a year later losing to him in another Last Man Standing match at One Night Stand in 2008.[63] Rising star CM Punk made his WWE debut in 2006, wrestling his first main roster match at Survivor Series that year in a 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination match as part of Team DX in a clean sweep victory over Team Rated-RKO. In 2008, he won the money in the bank briefcase, and on the June 30 episode of Raw, he cashed it in on the then-World Heavyweight Champion Edge, winning the title. The same night, he had to defend the title against John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield in the main event, but retained it.[64][65] The final pay-per-view event to receive an adult-oriented rating was The Great American Bash in 2008, where Triple H retained the WWE Championship against Edge in the main event. Following the event, WWE shifted to TV-PG, family-friendly programming.[66] Money in the Bank (2005)[edit] Main article: Money in the Bank ladder match The concept for the Money in the Bank match was introduced in March 2005 by Chris Jericho.[67] Jericho pitched the idea on an episode of Raw to general manager Eric Bischoff, who liked it and promptly signed it for WrestleMania 21, assigning Jericho, Christian, Chris Benoit, Edge, Shelton Benjamin, and Kane to participate in the match. Edge won this inaugural match, and since, many times the match became a way to help elevate new stars to the main event, with winners such as CM Punk, The Miz, Daniel Bryan, Alberto Del Rio, Seth Rollins, and Dean Ambrose.[68] The match format was originally exclusive to the annual WrestleMania until 2010, when the Money in the Bank pay-per-view debuted. In 2017, Shane McMahon announced the first-ever women's Money in the Bank match, which was won by Carmella. Return of ECW (2006–2010)[edit] Paul Heyman, the owner of ECW Main article: ECW (WWE brand) See also: WWE ECW By 2004, WWE began reintroducing Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) through content from the ECW video library and a series of books, which included the release of The Rise and Fall of ECW. On May 26, 2006, WWE officially announced the relaunch of the franchise with its own show on NBC Universal's Sci Fi Channel, later to be known as Syfy, starting June 13, 2006.[69] Despite initial concerns that professional wrestling would not be accepted by Sci Fi Channel's demographic, network President Bonnie Hammer stated that she believed ECW would fit the channel's theme of ""stretching the imagination"".[70] On June 13, Paul Heyman, former ECW owner and newly-appointed figurehead for the ECW brand, recommissioned the ECW World Heavyweight Championship to be the brand's world championship and awarded it to Rob Van Dam as a result of winning the WWE Championship at One Night Stand 2006. Under the WWE banner, ECW was presented in a modernized style to that when it was an independent promotion and was produced following the same format of the other brands, with match rules, such as count outs and disqualifications, being standard. Matches featuring the ruleset of the ECW promotion were classified as being contested under ""Extreme Rules"" and were only fought when specified otherwise.[69] The brand would continue to operate until February 16, 2010, when the brand was rendered defunct. PG Era (2008–2014)[edit] Main article: PG Era In the summer of 2008, WWE began distancing itself from the edgier content of years past, going with a more conservative approach. On July 22, 2008, all WWE programming transitioned to a PG television rating, with the 2008 SummerSlam event being the first pay-per-view event held under PG ratings. Although the SmackDown-brand TV shows were always held under TV-PG ratings since inception in 1999, in 2008, Raw TV shows, which were broadcast in TV-14 ratings, started to be broadcast under TV-PG ratings.[71] While fans would dub this the ""PG Era"" early on, references from wrestlers themselves would come later such as Triple H in his ""Thy Kingdom Come"" documentary and Natalya on an episode of ""Table for 3"". Another most notable example was that John Cena's famous finishing move, the F-U, was renamed Attitude Adjustment. Intentionally blading, which was common until then, became forbidden in the WWE. John Cena remained the top star of the company during this era. New superstars Sheamus and Alberto del Rio also registered notable success during this period, winning the WWE Championship in the years 2009 and 2011, respectively.[72][73] Also in 2009, D-Generation X reunited and would win the unified WWE tag team titles from Chris Jericho and The Big Show in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match.[74] A rivalry between straight edge CM Punk and drug addict Jeff Hardy in 2009 over Hardy's real-life drug addiction issues received critical acclaim, and after Punk forced Hardy to storyline quit the WWE, Punk would form the villainous stable Straight Edge Society that would feud with fan-favorite Rey Mysterio throughout 2010.[75] John Cena (left) and The Rock (right) in the April 04, 2011 episode of Raw, they had an on and off cross-generational feud between 2011–2013. CM Punk became one of the most popular and high-profile wrestlers in the WWE during this period, and holds a record 434 days long WWE Championship reign, the longest reign of the title in the company in 25 years. At WrestleMania XXVI in 2010, veteran wrestler Shawn Michaels retired following a loss to The Undertaker. In August 2011, WWE began to phase out the brand extension when they gave Raw the tagline ""SuperShow"", meaning wrestlers could appear on both Raw and SmackDown.[76] The year 2011 saw a highly acclaimed feud between the company's two most high-profile superstars at that point, John Cena and CM Punk. Their match at Money in the Bank on July 17, 2011 was named one of the greatest matches in WWE history. Punk, who had become a top star during the summer of 2011 due to his infamous ""pipe bomb"" promo, would hold the WWE Championship for 434 days before losing to The Rock in 2013 at the 2013 Royal Rumble, a reign recognized by WWE as the sixth-longest championship reign of all time and the longest in 25 years.[77] The Rock defended the championship until he was defeated by John Cena at WrestleMania 29 in a rematch from their bout the previous year. Popular stable The Shield was prominently featured during this period.[78] On December 15, 2013, the World Heavyweight Championship and WWE Championship were unified in a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match between John Cena and Randy Orton, which Orton won and the unified championship was briefly called the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, but would soon be renamed as just the WWE Championship.[79][80] Launch of NXT (2010)[edit] Main article: WWE NXT (TV series) On February 23, 2010, WWE launched a new program on Syfy called NXT.[81] The premise of the show was a reality-like show which saw eight new stars (Rookies) being mentored by Superstars from the main roster (Pros), and ran for just over three months, with the last episode of the first season being on June 1, 2010. The winner of the season was Wade Barrett, mentored by Chris Jericho. Six days after the end of the first season, the rookies, now calling themselves The Nexus, interfered in the Raw main event match between John Cena and CM Punk, attacking both competitors and the announcing team, before dismantling the ring area and surrounding equipment.[82] During the segment, Daniel Bryan strangled ring announcer Justin Roberts with the announcer's own tie, which WWE reportedly felt was too violent for their family-friendly programming. As a consequence, WWE announced via their official website four days later that Bryan had been (legitimately) released from his contract.[83][84] Bryan was later rehired due to fans' outrage over his firing and joined Team WWE against Team Nexus in the 2010 SummerSlam event in a 7-on-7 elimination tag team match, which Team WWE won.[85] NXT lasted for a further three complete seasons, which were won respectively by Kaval, Kaitlyn, and Johnny Curtis. A fifth season, dubbed NXT Redemption, featuring former NXT participants, never announced a winner and quietly ended with Derrick Bateman being the sole remaining participant. Eventually, the show morphed into both a television show and WWE's new official development territory, replacing Florida Championship Wrestling, and is permanently located at Full Sail University.[86][87] Reality Era (2014–2016)[edit] Main article: The Reality Era Brock Lesnar broke The Undertaker's undefeated Wrestlemania streak In 2013, Daniel Bryan became one of the most popular wrestlers in the company. On several occasions, fans would begin hijacking segments in which Bryan was either not involved in, or involved only secondarily, with his ""Yes!"" chant.[88] The night after the 2014 Royal Rumble, CM Punk quit WWE due to feeling mistreated by officials within the company, while also dealing with a misdiagnosed staph infection. Meanwhile, fan outrage over the misuse of Bryan's character resulted in an unplanned change for the WrestleMania XXX main event. On the March 24, 2014 episode of Raw, Bryan's rival at the time, Triple H, dubbed this point in WWE as ""The Reality Era"". Bryan would eventually be inserted into the main event of WrestleMania, defeating Randy Orton and Batista in a critically-acclaimed triple threat match, and capture the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in the process. Also at WrestleMania XXX, The Undertaker was defeated for the first time at the event by Brock Lesnar, following 21 consecutive victories dating back to 1991.[89][90] Lesnar would then defeat John Cena at SummerSlam to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.[91] This was seen as the end of Cena's position as the face of WWE, a position Cena had held since 2005. Lesnar would go on to be featured as the most dominant wrestler of this era.[92][93] The introduction of the WWE Network and the WWE Performance Center were also major breakthroughs during this period. On a ""Stone Cold Podcast"" episode that aired on the WWE Network in 2015, Triple H and Stone Cold Steve Austin both stated that ""kayfabe has died"" in modern WWE. Triple H also acknowledged that fans nowadays are more knowledgeable about the behind-the-scenes workings of WWE, as well as have more influence on the company than ever before.[94][95][96] The Triple Threat match at the 2015 Royal Rumble event between Seth Rollins, John Cena, and Brock Lesnar received critical acclaim and was widely recognized as one of the best the match of the year.[97] The WWE United States Championship Open Challenge match between the Champion John Cena and challenger Antonio Cesaro on the July 6, 2015 edition of Raw was also widely praised as one of the best matches in Raw history and was awarded the Slammy award for the best US title open challenge match by the WWE.[98][99] WCW legend Sting, who had previously been dubbed the ""greatest wrestler to never wrestle in WWE"",[100] made his debut at the 2014 Survivor Series and had his first-ever match in WWE at WrestleMania 31 against Triple H, a match he would lose. Also at WrestleMania 31, Seth Rollins became the first person to cash in a Money in the Bank contract at WrestleMania when he did so during the main event match between Brock Lesnar and Roman Reigns. WrestleMania 32 in Arlington, Texas (billed as Dallas) garnered the largest crowd to ever attend a WWE event, surpassing a disputed 100,000 attendees. In the main event, Roman Reigns defeated Triple H to capture the WWE World Heavyweight Championship despite a segment of the WWE fans pushing back on Reigns' push from the company in the lead-up.[101] The Authority officially disbanded on May 1, 2016.[102] New Era (2016–present)[edit] Main article: The New Era Charlotte Flair made history in 2016 by being the first woman to main event a WWE pay per view (along with Sasha Banks) and has been the symbolic female superstar of the ""New"" era, which is credited as the era of women's evolution in the WWE. At Wrestlemania 34 in 2018, Charlotte ended Asuka's 914 days undefeated streak. The three members of The Shield - Seth Rollins, Dean Ambrose, and Roman Reigns, have been by far the most-featured stars in the WWE in the men's division during the New Era. The 2016 Payback event, held on May 1, 2016, was billed as the start of a ""New Era"". In the main event, Roman Reigns would retain the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against AJ Styles. Reigns would go on to be prominently featured throughout this era. Later in May 2016, WWE announced that a roster split, similar to the one in 2002, would take place beginning in July. The three former members of The Shield - Dean Ambrose, Roman Reigns, and Seth Rollins - have been heavily featured since the start of the New Era, with all three men exchanging the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Money in the Bank in June 2016.[103] While the now renamed WWE World Championship would be moved to the SmackDown brand, the new WWE Universal Championship was introduced for the Raw brand, with Finn Bálor becoming the inaugural champion. The Divas division was rebranded as the Women's division and the company introduced a new WWE Women's Championship and retired the former Divas Championship. Female Superstars also began receiving more air time for their matches, and begun receiving as much spotlight as male superstars, thus the ""New era"" has been credited as being the start of the ""women's evolution.""[104] On the Raw-branded Hell in a Cell pay-per-view event in 2016, Charlotte Flair and Sasha Banks made history being in the first WWE pay-per-view event main-evented by women and participating in the first-ever women's Hell in a Cell match.[105] Women started to participate in matches that, before then, were male-only, like the Money in the Bank, Royal Rumble, and Elimination Chamber. On October 28, 2018, WWE held their first all-women pay per view, WWE Evolution, which saw a highly-acclaimed last woman standing match between Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair, which Lynch won. At this point, Becky Lynch started referring to herself as ""The Man"", becoming one of the most popular stars.[106] This culminated at WrestleMania 35, where three women, Becky Lynch, Charlotte Flair, and Ronda Rousey main-evented the PPV, with Becky Lynch winning the match. This would be the first time in history that WrestleMania would be main evented by women.[107][108] In another notable occurrence at WrestleMania 35, Kofi Kingston became the first African born WWE Champion by defeating Daniel Bryan at the event.[109][110] Becky Lynch became a very popular star during this period. She popularly proclaimed herself as ""The Man"" WWE would also go on to establish Braun Strowman as one of the biggest superstars of the company in 2017 after he attacked and injured Reigns during an interview on Raw. Strowman went on to beat down other wrestlers on the roster and have a decisive victory over Reigns at Payback on April 30.[111] Top wrestler John Cena became a part-timer around this time and lost to Roman Reigns in what is considered as a ""passing the torch match"" at No Mercy.[112] The New Day would also register notable success, becoming record eight-time tag-team champions. The New Day and The Shield faced off at the 2017 Survivor Series event, a match the Shield won.[113] Shield member Dean Ambrose left the WWE in 2019.[114] Bray Wyatt, with his new monster persona gimmick ""The Fiend,"" found much success during this period, winning the WWE Universal Championship in 2019.[115] WrestleMania 36 became the first WrestleMania to be taped with no attendance, as opposed to airing live, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was shown on two nights of April 4 and April 5 respectively. In the main event of Night 1, The Undertaker defeated AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was well-praised, and later in November 2020 confirmed to be Undertaker's final match.[116][117] In the main event of Night 2, Drew McIntyre defeated Brock Lesnar for the WWE Championship in a match critically panned for its short length.[118] Despite having no attendance due to the circumstances, WrestleMania 36 was the most-viewed event in WWE history, with a record 967 million views combining both nights across the company's digital and social platforms.[119][120] On July 2, 2020, the WWE had purchased rival turned partnered-wrestling promotion Evolve and acquired all their wrestling talents and rights.[121] Bobby Lashley who left WWE in 2007 came back to WWE after a decade in 2018 and in 2021 won the WWE Championship and defeated Drew McIntyre at night 1 of WrestleMania 37 to retain the title. Bianca Belair became a dominant star in the women's division in 2021, after she won the 2021 Women's Royal Rumble match and defeated Sasha Banks in the main event of night 1 of WrestleMania 37 to win the SmackDown Women’s Championship.[122] Move to Peacock (2021)[edit] In 2021, WWE announced that NBCUniversal Television and Streaming had acquired the exclusive U.S. distribution rights to WWE Network, and that the service would be folded into the NBCUniversal-owned streaming service Peacock on March 18, 2021 ahead of the 2021 Fastlane event. Existing and future WWE Network content started to be hosted by a branded channel within the Peacock service starting with Fastlane,[123] with the full service included as part of the paid Peacock Premium tier (which features a wider array of television, film, and sports programming), and a selection of WWE Network content (such as E! reality shows Total Divas and Total Bellas) available within its free tier.[124] WWE committed to produce a ""signature documentary"" for the service annually beginning in 2022.[125] Some sources reported this as the start of the ""Peacock Era"".[126][127][123][128][129] After a transitional period, the standalone WWE Network ceased operations in the United States on April 4, 2021.[124] Not all content was available at launch, as the service's library is being audited to meet NBCUniversal standards and practices[130] Due to Peacock's heavy censorship policy, the company began to achieve much criticism among the fans and critics alike, especially after Peacock's removal of some of the contents that were considered iconic moments of the Attitude Era that were deemed inappropriate by Peacock, these archived contents would no longer be available under any of WWE's authorized platforms.[131][132] Peacock would also gain extensive control over WWE's newer contents making them more family-friendly and politically correct.[133][134][135] Amdist the criticisms, in April 2021 WWE executive Triple H defended WWE's move to Peacock.[136] After numerous technical difficulties in viewing Money in the Bank via peacock in July 2021, several fans and critics called for for WWE to cancel their partnership with Peacock.[137] Other[edit] WWE Online[edit] In 1998, Shane McMahon helped form WWE's digital media department and launched WWF.com on May 21, 1998 (now known as WWE.com), a site that receives more than seven million hits a month.[citation needed] Death of Owen Hart[edit] Main article: Owen Hart Owen Hart On May 23, 1999, Owen Hart fell to his death in Kansas City, Missouri during the Over the Edge pay-per-view event.[138] Hart was in the process of being lowered via harness and grapple line into the ring from the rafters of Kemper Arena for a booked Intercontinental Championship match against The Godfather. In keeping with his Blue Blazer's new ""buffoonish superhero"" character, he was to begin a dramatic entrance, being lowered to just above ring level, at which time he would act ""entangled"", then release himself from the safety harness and fall flat on his face for comedic effect—this necessitated the use of a quick release mechanism. It was an elaboration on a Blue Blazer stunt done previously on the Sunday Night Heat before Survivor Series in 1998.[139] While being lowered into the ring, Hart fell 78 feet (24 m), landing chest-first on the top rope (approximately a foot from the nearest turnbuckle), throwing him into the ring.[140] Hart had performed the stunt only a few times before. Hart's widow Martha has suggested that, by moving around to get comfortable with both the harness and his cape on, Hart unintentionally triggered an early release. Television viewers did not see the incident. Moments after the fall, a pre-taped vignette was being shown on the pay-per-view broadcast as well as on the monitors in the darkened arena. Afterward, while Hart was being worked on by medical personnel inside the ring, the live event's broadcast showed only the audience. Meanwhile, WWF television announcer Jim Ross repeatedly told those watching live on pay-per-view that what had just transpired was not a wrestling angle or storyline and that Hart was hurt badly, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation.[141] Hart was transported to Truman Medical Center in Kansas City. While several attempts to revive him were made, he died from his injuries; some believe he died in the ring.[142] The cause of death was later revealed to be internal bleeding from blunt force trauma.[143] Legends program and the WWE Hall of Fame[edit] Main article: WWE Hall of Fame The Legends program began informally with the return of the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony in 2004, held annually during WrestleMania weekends. The introduction of WWE 24/7, WWE's on-demand television service, the WWE Network, WWE's over-the-top streaming service and the success of career retrospective home video releases such as The Ultimate Ric Flair Collection, Roddy Piper: Born to Controversy, and Brian Pillman: Loose Cannon have ingrained WWE's modern product with a sense of heritage, and allows a new generation of wrestling fans to witness matches and events they may only previously have heard of. WWE will also offer a select group of former or retired WWE wrestlers, billing them publicly as ""WWE Legends"", contracts to make periodic appearances—either on WWE TV or for promotional events—and to serve as ""Ambassadors"" (public representatives/spokespeople) for the company. Death of Eddie Guerrero[edit] Main article: Eddie Guerrero Eddie Guerrero as one half of the WWE Tag Team Champions On the morning of November 13, 2005, Chavo Guerrero checked into a hotel with his uncle, Eddie Guerrero, in Minneapolis, Minnesota where they were both scheduled be a part of a planned Raw and SmackDown! ""Supershow"" (a show where both Raw and SmackDown! would take place the same night in the same arena). After Eddie missed a wake-up call, security opened his hotel room and Chavo found his uncle unconscious. Chavo attempted CPR, but 38-year-old Eddie was declared dead at the scene. Vickie Guerrero, Eddie's wife, later announced that an autopsy ruled the cause of death to be massive heart failure. Guerrero's death fell on the day that he had been scheduled to compete in a match for the World Heavyweight Championship versus Batista and Randy Orton. The company held tributes to Guerrero on both Raw and SmackDown during the week following his death. On April 1, 2006 at the WWE Hall of Fame induction ceremonies during WrestleMania 22 weekend, Guerrero's wife Vickie accepted his posthumous induction into WWE Hall of Fame by Rey Mysterio, Chris Benoit, and his nephew Chavo Guerrero. Following Guerrero's death, Vince McMahon announced a new drug policy under which performers would be subject to random drug tests by an independent company and would receive regular medical physicals with an emphasis on cardiovascular health.[144] Chris Benoit's double-murder and suicide[edit] Main article: Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide Chris Benoit On June 25, 2007, the Fayette County Police notified WWE around 4:15 p.m., informing them that they had discovered three bodies of Chris, Nancy, and their seven-year-old son Daniel Benoit at their home in Fayette County, Georgia, and the house was now ruled as a ""major crime scene"". WWE canceled the scheduled three-hour-long live Raw show on June 25 (which, coincidentally, was supposed to be a scripted memorial for the Mr. McMahon character), and replaced the broadcast version with a tribute to his life and career, featuring past matches, segments from the Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story DVD, and comments from wrestlers and announcers from the Raw, SmackDown! and the now-defunct ECW brands. Shortly after the program aired, many of the aired comments were posted on WWE.com. It was not until the program was nearly over that reports surfaced that police were working under the belief that Benoit murdered his wife and son before killing himself over a three-day period.[citation needed] The next night, after some of the details of the deaths became available, the company aired a recorded statement by its chairman Vince McMahon before their ECW broadcast: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Last night on Monday Night Raw, the WWE presented a special tribute show, recognizing the career of Chris Benoit. However, now some 26 hours later, the facts of this horrific tragedy are now apparent. Therefore, other than my comments, there will be no mention of Mr. Benoit's name tonight. On the contrary, tonight's show will be dedicated to everyone who has been affected by this terrible incident. This evening marks the first step of the healing process. Tonight, WWE performers will do what they do better than anyone else in the world: entertain you. Following the double-murder suicide committed by Chris Benoit, the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform began investigating WWE regarding their Wellness policy. After Benoit's death, the WWE began to tone down the violence, swearing and sexual content of their product. Furthermore, after further deaths among WWE wrestlers were found (including Benoit's) to have been caused by chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which was an emerging study in brain injuries in sport, WWE legitimately banned chair shots to the head. Social media and WWE HD[edit] The SmackDown stage, an example of the universal WWE High Definition stage set In January 2008, WWE began broadcasting in high-definition, beginning with the January 21 episode of Raw, while the 2008 Royal Rumble was the first pay-per-view event presented in HD.[145][146] On November 19, 2008, WWE officially launched their online social network, WWE Universe. It opened in April as WWE Fan Nation, and adopted the name WWE Universe a few months later. The website was similar to MySpace, with blogs, forums, photos, videos, and other features.[147][148] Despite a heightened popularity the site was shut down on January 1, 2011 and has since replaced with WWE InterAction.[149] Since closing down their social media website, WWE has created accounts on social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Tout, and Instagram, with executive vice president of digital media Perkins Miller stating that ""social media is going to transform our company"".[150] In July 2012, WWE made an investment of $5 million into Tout,[151] and a month later released an official app.[152] In 2013, WWE's main Twitter account was cited as one of the top 25 most engaged brands on the website.[153] In 2014, WWE launched WWE SuperCard, a trading card app game, which was downloaded 1.5 million times in the first week of its launch.[154] WWE Network[edit] Main article: WWE Network In September 2011, WWE officially announced plans to launch the WWE Network in time for WrestleMania XXVIII.[155][156] WWE's official website featured a countdown clock that would have expired on April 1, 2012[157] however, the clock was quietly removed, and the network did not launch as advertised. At the Consumer Electronics Show on January 8, 2014, WWE announced the WWE Network would launch on February 24, 2014 in the United States. WWE called the network ""the first-ever 24/7 streaming network"".[158][159] On February 27, 2014, the WWE Network aired its first live event, NXT Arrival, which featured three championship matches and a well-received match between Cesaro and Sami Zayn.[160] Despite #CancelWWENetwork[161] trending on social media in early 2015 after angry fans were upset with the booking of the 2015 Royal Rumble match, the trend did not prevent the Network from its continued growth, reaching 1 million subscribers the very same week.[162][163] Pink Ribbon campaigning[edit] Starting in October 2012, WWE formed a partnership with Susan G. Komen for the Cure to promote breast cancer awareness.[164] As part of the campaign, WWE adorned their sets with pink ribbons, put up a pink middle rope on the ring, filmed numerous PSAs, and sold special John Cena ""Rise Above Cancer"" merchandise.[165] All of these efforts culminated in a donation from WWE of $1 million, which was presented to Susan G. Komen representatives in an in-ring ceremony during the October 29, 2012 episode of Raw.[166] The campaign continued every year since,[167] but caused controversy as the foundation has been accused of pinkwashing.[165] Backstage harassment[edit] In April 2017, WWE became embroiled in a scandal concerning the company allowing certain employees to harass others, most notably John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield. According to multiple sources including Dave Meltzer's Wrestling Observer, hazing is something which is encouraged by the higher ups in the company and has been going on since the company's inception.[168][169][170] Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2021)[edit] Further information: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports In March 2020, WWE began to be impacted by the American onset of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The March 11 episode of NXT was filmed without spectators at the WWE Performance Center facility in Orlando, as three of the four major sports leagues had announced two days earlier that they would close locker rooms to the media as a precautionary measure. As other sports cancellations and postponements were being announced, WWE officially announced on March 12 that its weekly programs, beginning with the following night's episode of SmackDown, would be filmed at the Performance Center with no spectators and only essential staff present.[171][172] Major pay per view events including WrestleMania 36 have been aired taped without any attendance as opposed to being aired live.[173] NXT has continued to air from Full Sail University, but under similar restrictions.[174][175] The highly advertised NXT TakeOver: In Your House aired taped in June 2020, however certain WWE officials were used as part of a very limited crowd for the event.[176] Live broadcasts returned on April 13, with the existing arrangements continuing; WWE stated to ESPN.com that ""we believe it is now more important than ever to provide people with a diversion from these hard times"", and that the company's programming ""bring[s] families together and deliver a sense of hope, determination and perseverance"".[174][175] It was subsequently reported that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis had deemed WWE a business critical to the state's economy, and had added an exception under the state's stay-at-home order for employees of a ""professional sports and media production"" that is closed to the public and has a national audience.[177][178] The decision was met with criticism from media outlets, with several media outlets pointing out that DeSantis' actions happened on the same day a pro-Donald Trump political action committee led Linda McMahon, who was previously a part of Trump's cabinet, pledged to spend $18.5 million in advertising in Florida, and that, also on the same day, Vince McMahon was named part of an advisory group created by Trump to devise a strategy in re-launching US economy.[179][180][181][182] On April 15, WWE announced a series of cuts and layoffs in response to the pandemic, including releasing a number of personnel. WWE executives also took a pay cut, and the company has also suspended construction on its new headquarters for at least six months.[183] The firings released significant backlash with both fans; with Business Insider calling them ""livid."" Both fans and several media outlets pointed out that while WWE claimed that these actions were ""necessary due to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic"". The WWE also claimed to have ""substantial financial resources. Available cash and debt capacity currently total approximately $0.5 billion"". DeSantis' claimed WWE was ""essential"", which meant that the company's revenues loss would be limited.[179][184] See also[edit] WWE WCW ECW References[edit] ^ ""Live & Televised Entertainment"".

"WWE Libraries - Wikipedia WWE Libraries From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Subdisiary of American professional wrestling company, WWE WWE Libraries Inc.TypeSubsidiaryIndustryProfessional wrestling, sports entertainment, tape libraryFounded2001HeadquartersStamford, Connecticut, USAArea servedWorldwideProductsDVD, Blu-ray, VHS, Online Streaming, Channel SubscriptionsNumber of employeesN/AParentWWESubsidiariesAmerican Wrestling AssociationGeorgia Championship WrestlingExtreme Championship WrestlingWorld Championship WrestlingEvolve[1] WWE Libraries Inc.[2] (branded as WWE Legacy Department[3]) is a WWE-owned subsidiary that consists of the largest collection of professional wrestling videos and copyrights in the world.[4] It is comprised not only of past and current works by WWE (formerly the Capitol Wrestling Corporation, World Wide Wrestling Federation, World Wrestling Federation, and World Wrestling Entertainment) but the works of now defunct professional wrestling promotions dating back to the 1940s.[5] As of 2014, the library stands at 150,000 hours of content[6] including weekly television shows, pay-per-views, and recorded house shows.[4] The collection represents a very significant portion of the visual history of modern professional wrestling in the United States and Canada. WWE has made their classic holdings available through numerous home-video releases, the WWE Vintage television program, and the WWE Network. The dates listed below for purchased organizations and libraries represent the duration of that company, and may not necessarily represent the extent of historical video owned. Contents 1 Classic WWE holdings 2 Non-WWE purchases 3 National Wrestling Alliance 4 Condition 5 Editing 6 See also 7 Notes 8 References 9 Notes Classic WWE holdings[edit] The library includes all past and present WWE tapes dating back to the 1950s, including all previous forms of the company. Although not wrestling content, the library's holdings also includes footage from various WWF/E produced ventures including documentaries, reality shows, and fictional works produced for home video, the WWE Network and other broadcasters, and any motion pictures produced by WWE Studios. The footage saved from WWE's days as the Capitol Wrestling Corporation is also among the few surviving footage of broadcasts from the DuMont Television Network, as most of their footage was destroyed in the mid-1970s.[7][8] Non-WWE purchases[edit] For years, WWE has engaged in a campaign of purchasing libraries of defunct wrestling promotions. The first significant purchases took place in 2001 when they bought the complete historical archives of their former competitor World Championship Wrestling.[9] The purchase of the Extreme Championship Wrestling intellectual unit and library during its bankruptcy proceedings in 2003[10] gave the company the majority of all national professional wrestling content available at the time.

WWE bought the video library from the private owner. ^**** While WWE owns the library, Bret Hart owns the rights to the footage of his matches National Wrestling Alliance[edit] Throughout its history, WWE has had a long relationship with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). For many decades, until the mid-1980s, the NWA acted as a governing body of the many various regional wrestling promotions, and membership allowed for decreased regional competition and the shared use of big-name stars for local events. WWE (as Capitol Wrestling) was a member of the NWA between 1952 and 1963, and again (as the WWWF) between 1971 and 1983. In 1998, WWE (as the WWF) hosted NWA matches on its programming. Jim Crockett Promotions was an NWA member for its entire existence and by the end of the promotion's run was, more or less, the NWA, thanks to its control of the largest regional NWA promotions. This was exemplified by the presence of all major NWA titles in World Championship Wrestling when Crockett Promotions morphed into WCW in the 1980s. WCW's relationship with the NWA was even more convoluted than WWE's until WCW left the NWA in 1993. As a result of WWE's former membership in the NWA, through its ownership of WCW and its predecessor libraries, and through its ownership of Extreme Championship Wrestling (which was an NWA member until it suddenly severed ties in 1994) and other smaller regional promotions, WWE owns a vast amount of NWA footage, making up the majority of significant NWA matches from the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. Condition[edit] Although professional wrestling has been on television throughout the medium's existence, not all broadcasts were recorded, nor necessarily saved, and most promotions did not have a regular television presence until the 1970s. Most broadcasts were taped over, so very little footage exists from pre-1970s promotions. This includes the WWE precursor Capitol Wrestling Corporation. The historical availability of individual, non-televised matches is also incomplete, as likely only the most significant bouts were recorded for posterity, and can be lost to time. Several factors have adversely affected the quality of some surviving tapes. Upon taking control of the World Championship Wrestling library, it was noted that the tapes were unlabeled and not categorized.[16] The condition of some WCW tapes is such that WWE could not air them on WWE Classics on Demand, or on the WWE Network.[17] Editing[edit] WWE owns the unedited master tapes for all content in the library. However, due to a lawsuit over the ""WWF"" initials brought on by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), from May 2002 until June 2012, they were not allowed to use the letters WWF or the ""scratch"" logo used between December 15, 1997, and May 5, 2002 (the pre-""scratch"" logo was not covered under this lawsuit, with a variation of this being used in the November 15, 2010 WWE Raw Old School edition).[18] As a result, any instances of someone saying ""WWF"" (though not World Wrestling Federation) were edited and shots of the ""scratch"" logo were either removed or blurred on re-airings or video releases released during that time frame, except for the UK exclusive WWE Tagged Classics DVD range. In late July 2012, WWE reached a settlement with the WWF which once again allows them to use the ""WWF"" initials and scratch logo on archive footage. Unedited footage first appeared on Raw 1000 and since then has appeared in full-length matches posted to the WWE website and home video releases. In exchange, WWE is no longer permitted to use the WWF initials or logo in any new, original footage, with any old-school logos for retro-themed programming now using the original WWF logo, but modified without the F.[19] Music rights issues are also reasons for occasional editing by WWE of its library when airing or releasing videos. While most wrestlers' entrance themes are done in-house (notably by composer Jim Johnston), those whose music is not owned by WWE are often dubbed over with cheaper alternatives rather than providing the original audio, to save WWE paying licensing fees to the writers/performers of the original songs. Videos heavily affected in particular by these cost-cutting decisions are those featuring footage from Extreme Championship Wrestling, which was famous for using recordings by mainstream music acts such as Metallica, AC/DC, and Dr. Dre for their wrestlers' entrances, although AC/DC and Metallica have provided music for WWE pay-per-view events as well. Exceptions to non-Johnston composed themes that WWE leaves in its archives are either songs that are in the public domain, such as the ""Dawn"" section of Also sprach Zarathustra used by Ric Flair and Pomp and Circumstance, which was used by Gorgeous George and later Randy Savage; or songs that the WWE acquired from its purchase of WCW, most notably the entrance music for Booker T. Additionally, wrestlers who worked for WWE but whose entrance music in other promotions may be owned by an outside company have had their songs in those promotions replaced by their WWE counterparts, such as Chris Jericho's WCW theme being replaced by his WWE theme. Due to a 1991 lawsuit, matches featuring Jesse Ventura on commentary were dubbed over for subsequent home video releases. However, matches featuring Ventura commentating are shown with unaltered audio on the WWE Network.[20] Since 2007, WWE has edited footage featuring Chris Benoit from repeat broadcasts, due to Benoit's murder-suicide. WWE has released some footage of Benoit from its library as well as WCW and ECW in the years since, but all of these have been group shots not focused on Benoit (most notably the 2004 Royal Rumble). Benoit's wife Nancy Benoit, who performed in a manager role in WCW under the stage name Woman, was also initially removed, but footage of her was later re-added. All archive footage of Chris Benoit has been available uncut on the WWE Network since its launch in 2014. When WWE Network programming began being moved to Peacock in the United States in 2021, WWE and NBCUniversal began editing controversial content from WWE's past in order to meet NBCU's standards and practices; this also applied to the standalone WWE Network feed that remained overseas.[21] See also[edit] History of WWE WWE Home Video Notes[edit] References[edit] ^ ""WWE Acquires Evolve Wrestling"".

It primarily distributes original professional wrestling events, films, television and documentary series, and a 24-hour linear channel produced by the eponymous wrestling promotion, alongside acquired programming from other wrestling promotions. WWE Network relied on technology developed by MLB Advanced Media and BAMTech, prior to Endeavor Streaming assuming technical operations of the service in 2019. Although operating primarily as a standalone service, the distribution model of the WWE Network varies by market, where it is often integrated within or as part of local networks. It contains a premium and a free tier. WWE Network was launched on February 24, 2014, in the United States, in Canada in July of that year, and expanded to the Pacific and select European countries in August. The United Kingdom received the service in January 2015, and was made available in the Middle East and parts of Africa that March, and to India in November. It was launched in additional European and Asian countries in January 2016. Upon launch, the WWE Network was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. The service had 1.5 million subscribers as of October 30, 2020. In January 2021, NBCUniversal Television and Streaming acquired exclusive rights to distribute the WWE Network in the United States, and the American version of the service was integrated into the premium tier of its service Peacock, with the original service discontinued on April 4.

The Delaware Chancery Court ruled in favor of the WWF in June 2000.[1][2] Then CEO Linda McMahon revealed that WWF wanted its own cable network and testified that before WWF signed a rights deal with Viacom, the company had floated the idea of acquiring USA's Sci-Fi Channel, and reformatting it as a dedicated wrestling network. USA executives rejected the idea, and McMahon said that former USA Networks President Barry Baker encouraged her to talk to other programmers about potential deals. ""I can tell you right now, Linda, you're not going to get anybody to give you a network,"" McMahon testified.[1] In 2005, USA Network re-acquired the rights to all WWE programming. In September 2011, WWE officially announced plans to launch the WWE Network in 2012 as a pay-TV channel.[3] WWE then conducted a survey asking people if they would pay for the WWE Network if it were a premium channel. In an email sent to WWE fans who might be interested in the WWE Network, WWE surveyed fans for their thoughts about the WWE Network airing WWE's pay-per-views to subscribers for no additional charge. The survey also noted that feature repeats of Raw and SmackDown, as well as footage from World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), XFL, Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW), American Wrestling Association (AWA), and WWE films would also make the lineup. Original programming was also noted in the survey.[4][5] As the result of an online poll, WrestleMania Recap was chosen as a name for a new WWE Network show on October 17, 2011.[6] The original launch date was set for April 1, 2012, which would have coincided with WrestleMania XXVIII, and WWE's official website featured a countdown clock that would have expired on April 1. The clock was quietly removed, and the network did not launch as advertised.[7] WWE chief marketing officer Michelle Wilson allayed fears about the future of the WWE Network, saying ""There will be a WWE network in some shape or form. We are in late-stage negotiations with distributors"", and confirmed that WWE Legends' House had been filmed.[8] In April 2013, WWE had switched plans and aimed to release the WWE Network as a premium pay-TV outlet, with a potential price of $15 a month.[9] On Old School Raw in January 2014, WWE ran teasers promoting an announcement on January 8 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas,[10] later confirming that the announcement concerned the WWE Network.[11] At the Consumer Electronics Show, WWE revealed a comprehensive plan which would see a launch date of February 24, 2014 in the United States.[12][13][14] WWE Classics on Demand closed on January 31, 2014 to make way for the WWE Network.[15] A free trial period was offered during the week of the launch.[16] The logo initially used for the WWE Network eventually became the standard logo used by the WWE corporation in August 2014.[17] In April 2014, ahead of WrestleMania XXX, the Network received acclaim, with The New York Times saying that WWE had ""positioned themselves on the cutting edge of Internet television.""[18] Later that month, the company announced that the network had 667,000 subscribers, short of the one million subscribers they needed to break even.[19] As WWE's stock fell 50% the following month, Forbes described low subscription numbers as being of ""additional concern"" for investors after WWE's underwhelming NBCUniversal renewal deal.[20] WWE offered a second free preview week of the WWE Network, which started July 7, in an attempt to sign new subscribers.[21] A second report released at the end of July indicated that the network had reached 700,000 subscribers.[22] WWE's goal was to reach one million subscribers by the end of 2014.[22][23] Expansion[edit] On July 31, 2014, the company announced a 10-year, Canadian distribution deal for WWE content with Rogers Media (owner of Sportsnet 360, the historic carrier of WWE programming in Canada), which will see the company distribute WWE Network as a premium television service.[24] Also on that date, it was announced that the WWE Network would launch in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mexico, Spain, and the Nordics, among others on August 12, with Italian, Arab, German, Japanese, Indian, Chinese, Thai, and Malaysian launches planned for a later date.[25][26][27] On October 30, 2014, in an attempt to increase subscription numbers from an announced figure of 731,000, the 6-month subscription requirement was dropped, allowing subscribers the option to cancel at any time.[28][29] WWE had originally planned to launch the network on October 1 in the United Kingdom, but was delayed for a further month.[30] The launch was confirmed to be taking place at 8 p.m. on November 3;[31] however, 20 minutes prior to the launch, WWE announced that it had been indefinitely delayed.[32][33] Vince McMahon publicly apologized for the delay.[34] It was announced on January 4, 2015, that the WWE Network would be launching in the UK and Ireland on January 19, 2015, priced at £9.99 and €12.99, respectively,[35] although some customers managed to register as early as January 13.[36][37][38] On January 27, 2015, WWE announced that the WWE Network had reached 1 million subscribers,[39] with Vince McMahon saying that WWE would ""remain focused on delivering an outstanding value proposition for ours fans by adding new content and new features in the coming year.""[40] On February 12, 2015, WWE announced a five-year partnership with television provider OSN to bring the WWE Network to the Middle East and North Africa as a premium service.[41] On July 30, 2015, WWE revealed the number of subscribers for the Network at 1.156 million. This was announced as a part of WWE's financial reporting on the second quarter of the year, which had resulted in their stock price rising past $20.00 after closing on the previous day at $16.48. The total of 1.156 million paid subscribers marked a 13% decrease from the 1.315 million paid subscribers that was stated in the reports for the first quarter of 2015. WWE also revealed, including trial subscribers, they had 1.227 million Network users at the end of the second quarter, and over the entire lifespan of the Network, there have been over 2 million unique subscribers.[42] The WWE Network launched in India on November 2, 2015.[43][44] On November 19, a report by market research and consulting firm Park Associates announced that the WWE Network had broken into the top five streaming services and trailed only MLB.tv in the sports category.[45] The WWE announced the network would launch in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Japan on January 5, 2016,[46][47] followed by Thailand and the Philippines on February 29, 2016.[48] In April 2017, WWE announced a total of 1.949 million subscribers to the WWE Network, of which 1.661 million were paid subscribers.[49] At the end of the third quarter of 2017, the number had dropped to 1.5 million paid users.[50] In April 2018, WWE announced subscriber growth had reached 2.1 million, with 1.8 million paid.[51] At the end of the third quarter of 2018 the number had dropped to 1.6 million paid users.[50] Switch to Endeavor, redesign[edit] In January 2019, WWE Network signed with Endeavor Streaming to replace BAMTech as its operating partner.[52] WWE's decision was motivated by the acquisition of BAMTech by Disney.[53] Co-president George Barrios cited concerns over how BAMTech's relationships with third-party partners would be impacted by the sale, while WWE also sought greater control over the service and its operations, intending to partner with another vendor or take the service entirely in-house. The company decided to partner with Endeavor Streaming (formed primarily from the assets of NeuLion) to provide infrastructure and billing services, and Massive Interactive to develop a new front-end and mobile apps.[54] The new WWE Network platform launched in July 2019, ahead of SummerSlam. It includes a revamped user experience, support for 1080p streams, new browsing tools (such as a new ""Superstars"" interface for filtering content by performers), and plans to add a download feature for offline viewing in the future. Support for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and selected legacy smart TVs was discontinued with the changeover.[54] In an interview with The Verge, Barrios revealed that there were ongoing plans for WWE.com's existing video content to be integrated into the WWE Network platform as a ""free"" tier (possibly also including previews of WWE Network's premium content), and that WWE was also considering the development of a premium tier with additional features (such as benefits for other WWE operations).[54] In March 2020, amid the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and to promote WrestleMania 36, WWE Network made a selection of its premium content and archives available free for a limited time.[55] On June 1, 2020, WWE Network officially launched a free tier with 15,000 hours of content, which includes access to selected content such as recent episodes of its weekly programming, and original series such as Raw Talk, Monday Night War, and Ride Along. The service would be advertising-free, and was intended primarily to promote its weekly programs and pay-per-view events.[56] Merger of U.S. service into Peacock[edit] On January 25, 2021, WWE announced that NBCUniversal Television and Streaming had acquired the exclusive U.S. distribution rights to WWE Network, and that the service would be folded into the NBCUniversal-owned streaming service Peacock on March 18, 2021 (ahead of Fastlane and WrestleMania 37). Existing and future WWE Network content will be hosted by a branded channel within the Peacock service, with the full service included as part of the paid Peacock Premium tier (which features a wider array of television, film, and sports programming), and a selection of WWE Network content (including some of its original series such as The Bump and Raw Talk, and episodes of Total Divas and Total Bellas from NBCUniversal cable channel E!) available within its free tier.[57] WWE committed to produce a ""signature documentary"" for the service annually beginning in 2022.[58] After a transitional period, the standalone WWE Network ceased operations in the United States on April 4, 2021.[57][59] Not all content was available at launch, as the service's library is being audited to meet NBCUniversal standards and practices. WWE stated that the content migration would be completed by August 2021.[60] To coincide with the introduction, Peacock announced plans to offer a four-month half-price promotion for new Premium subscribers.[57][59] This agreement did not affect the service outside of the United States, which continues to be marketed as a standalone offering through either WWE or its local partners.[58][61] Availability[edit] Availability of the WWE Network globally   Available   Unavailable   No information The WWE Network is currently available through 186 out of 193 United Nations member states (including all 27 European Union nations) and two observer states such as the Holy See and the State of Palestine. It is also distributed through six non-UN countries: the Republic of China (Taiwan), the Cook Islands, Kosovo, Niue, Northern Cyprus and SADR-claimed Western Sahara. In late 2017, Liechtenstein and China were added to the list of non-available countries,[62] however the WWE Network is still available in the Chinese special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau as well as ROC-controlled Taiwan and Fujian.

Although the United States parental guidelines rating system rates most weekly WWE television programs TV-PG, the WWE Network broadcasts a wider range of content. A parental controls block is available and content rated TV-14 and TV-MA are preceded by an advisory warning. The network airs footage featuring Chris Benoit; it marks the first major airing of Benoit footage or even mention of Benoit in said footage since his murder-suicide in 2007.[92] However, the Benoit tribute episode of Raw is replaced with the episode that aired internationally, a recap of championship matches. Also, Vengeance: Night of Champions in 2007 removes all references to Benoit during the ECW World Championship match. Over the Edge 1999, infamous for Owen Hart's death at the event, is also available for the first time since its original air date; however, some portions of the event have been edited out of respect to the Hart family.[93] Matches called with Jesse Ventura on commentary, which had previously been dubbed over due to a 1991 lawsuit, are available with the original commentary.[94] While the network promoted on-demand airings as being unedited, some instances of expletives, gestures, and all nudity are censored. Many programs were digitized for WWE 24/7 prior to the 2012 settlement with the World Wide Fund for Nature, and thus the ""WWF"" and the ""WWF scratch"" logo are censored in some instances.[95][96] Some original music has been dubbed over with alternate tracks such as the original intro music to Saturday Night's Main Event (May 1985 – January 1988 episodes) which originally played ""Obsession"" by Animotion.[97] At launch, all but one of New Jack's matches were removed from ECW pay-per-views, as was his surprise return at Heat Wave 1998, due to a combination of musical rights issues over his entrance music and the inability to remove the music without losing the original commentary audio. The deleted matches were eventually reinstated with replacement music and newly recorded Joey Styles commentary.[98] Several pay-per-views are copies of their condensed home video releases, rather than the live versions, and so are missing matches.[99] Archive content on the Peacock-hosted version of WWE Network is being further edited for content by NBCUniversal. On launch, two pay-per-views were edited to remove racially-insensitive content; WrestleMania VI was edited to remove a match between Roddy Piper and Bad News Brown where Piper had painted half of his body black, and Survivor Series 2005 was edited to remove a backstage segment where Vince McMahon used a racial slur in front of Booker T and John Cena.[60] Pay-per-views[edit] Almost every WWF/WWE, JCP/WCW, and ECW pay-per-view (PPV) event ever produced is available for on-demand streaming.[94] Although WWE promotes the selection as every pay-per-view ever made, a handful of PPV events have not yet been made available.[100] This includes mostly foreign events such as WCW's Millennium Final, Collision in Korea, and the Japan Supershows, and ECW's foreign ECW/FMW Supershows, however it also includes some events held domestically such as WCW's Nitro Girls Swimsuit Calendar Special and When Worlds Collide, and WWF's No Holds Barred: The Match/The Movie.[a] In addition the pay-per-view section contains several events which did not air on pay-per-view, such as WWE events Royal Rumble 1988[101] and WWE Global Warning Tour: Melbourne.[102] Many ECW Supercards are also listed as pay-per-views, despite never actually airing there.[103] WWF/WWE home video[edit] The WWE released videos under the header ""Home video classics"" which include various previous home video releases that had been originally released under Coliseum Video.[104] Andre The Giant[105] Bashed in the USA[104] Battle Royal at the Albert Hall[104] Big, Small, Strange, Strong[104] Big Daddy Cool Diesel[106] Bloopers, Bleeps, and Bodyslams[104] Brains Behind the Brawn[104] Bret Hart: Greatest Matches[107] Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart[105] British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith[107] The British Bulldogs[106] Bruno Sammartino: Living Legend[108] Brutus The Barber Beefcake[106] Crunch Classic[104] Demolition[109] Euro Rampage '92[104] Funniest Moments[104] George 'The Animal' Steele[107] German Fan Favorites[106] Global Warfare[106] Global Warning Tour: Melbourne Grand Slams[104] Greatest Hits[104] Grudge Match '86[104] 'Hacksaw' Jim Duggan[107] The Hart Foundation[108] Hottest Matches[104] Hulk Hogan: Real American[108] The Hulkster Hulk Hogan[107] Inside the Steel Cage[104] Invasion '92[104] Invasion of the Bodyslammers[104] Jake The Snake Roberts[108] The Ken Patera Story[108] Life and Times: Capt.

Floyd Mayweather and Big Show documentary from 2014. Impact on pay-per-view industry[edit] In an interview with Time, Michelle D. Wilson, chief revenue and marketing officer for WWE, stated their reason for bypassing cable companies and instead only offering the WWE Network online: ""Digital over-the-top offerings represent the future, and given that our passionate fans consume five times more online video content than non-WWE viewers and over-index for purchasing online subscriptions such as Netflix and Hulu, we believe the time is now for a WWE Network.""[124] In response to the announcement, DirecTV issued a statement saying that they are re-evaluating whether to continue carrying WWE's pay-per-view events. Due to the fact that these events would also be available on the WWE Network once it launches, it might reduce the number of pay-per-view purchases via cable and satellite providers. Vince McMahon suggested that pay-TV operators would ultimately decide to continue to carry WWE's pay-per-view events, given that providers keep a significant share of each purchase, and incur minimal costs (apart from WWE's share of the fee for each purchase) to carry the events: ""It's found money for them.""[125] DirecTV later quietly dropped carriage of WWE PPVs. In response, WWE said, ""Yes, DIRECTV has decided to stop offering our PPV's residentially and commercially. The only other option would be to work through the local cable provider.""[126] On February 19, 2014, Dish Network announced that they would carry WWE pay-per-views on an event by event basis, beginning with Elimination Chamber. Dish Network later released a statement saying, ""Dish will not offer the ‘WWE Elimination Chamber’ PPV on 2/23. WWE is not willing to adjust their PPV costs to satellite and cable companies, which is unfair to their customers. We need to re-focus our efforts to support partners that better serve Dish customers.""[127] Dish later made a decision to air WrestleMania XXX.[128] Dish declined to offer WrestleMania 31 and 32 but did offer WrestleMania 33 in 2017.[129] Advertising[edit] In October 2014, it was reported Mattel, Kmart, and Pepsi would begin advertising on the network starting the week of October 13. Wilson stated that although no commercial breaks will occur during scheduled programming, 30 second adverts would run in between shows, and that one 15 or 30-second advert would be shown prior to every fourth stream of on-demand content.[130][131] Notes[edit] ^ The steel cage match from No Holds Barred: The Match/The Movie is available on the home video Supertape, which is available on the WWE Network.

""Everything is going to burn. Our land, our animals and our house. What else do we have anyway?""Hundreds of miles west, in the tourist hotspot of Bodrum, more than 1,000 people were evacuated by boat on both Sunday and Saturday to escape the wildfires. At least eight people have died in more than 100 blazes that broke out earlier this week, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency. The flames have been fueled by scorching summer temperatures and conditions that experts say have been worsened by climate change.Seven people were killed in the fires in Manavgat, Antalya Province, and the eighth victim died in Marmaris, Anadolu reported. The latest victims include a Turkish-German couple who were found in a house, it said.A vehicle burned in the fire that broke out in Mugla's Marmaris district in Turkey on July 30.Read MoreTwo firefighters died battling the blazes on Saturday, according to the Turkish Agriculture and Forestry Ministry.The ministry said that 111 fires have burned across the country since Wednesday, while six fires are still burning in three different cities as of Sunday.Evacuation by seaOn Turkey's Mediterranean coast, more than 1,100 people were evacuated from the tourist resort of Bodrum by sea on Sunday for the second-straight day.""We helped the evacuation of 1,140 people by 12 boats,"" Orhan Dinc, the president of the Bodrum Maritime Chamber, told CNN. ""We did evacuation by boats yesterday as well, but I have never witnessed something similar before in this region. This is the first time,"" he said.Dinc said that while roads remain open and evacuations continue by land, evacuation by sea helps keep roads clear for fire trucks and ambulances. Bodrum also evacuated 1,100 people using more than 20 boats on Saturday, the city's Mayor Ahmet Aras said. Bodrum is a popular destination for both Turkish and foreign tourists. Plumes of smoke from a wildfire are seen near a residential area in the holiday resort of Bodrum, on Saturday July 31.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared parts of five provinces on Turkey's Mediterranean coast ""disaster zones,"" following a helicopter visit to the devastated areas. ""We will continue to take all steps to heal the wounds of our people, to compensate for losses and to improve opportunities to better than before,"" the president added in a tweet Saturday.'Gone, gone, it's gone'The largest fire, in Manavgat, killed at least three people, according to the Turkish Natural Disaster and Emergency Directorate.In the nearby village of Kacarlar, residents are grappling with seeing homes they built by hand burn to the ground.Gulay Kacar, 48, told CNN: ""Everything is going to burn. Our land, our animals and our house.""""My father's house burned down,"" said 48-year-old Gulay Kacar. ""Gone, gone, it's gone,"" Kacar said, before adding that she was ""running to let the animals loose.""Namet Atik, a 37-year-old farmer from a neighboring village, said that he came to Kacarlar to help. ""Whatever this village needs ... we are here for them,"" he told CNN""We get them water, our cars, tractors, saws,"" he added. ""We are forest villagers. Our livelihood is the forest. If this fire runs, there is no return.""Around 4,000 personnel, along with hundreds of emergency vehicles, have been deployed by the government to help fight the flames this week. At least 77 houses have been damaged in the province of Antalya, and more than 2,000 farm animals have died, Turkey's Agriculture and Forestry Minister, Bekir Pakdemirli, told journalists on Thursday.Firefighters try to get the fire under control in Kirli village near the town of Manavgat, in Antalya province, early Friday July 30.A helicopter fights wildfires in Kacarlar village, near the Mediterranean coastal town of Manavgat, on Saturday, July 31.Scorching temperatures Hot and dry weather conditions had exacerbated the fires, Pakdemirli said on Thursday. He added that temperatures of 37 Celsius (98.6 Fahrenheit), less than 14% humidity and winds around 50 kilometers per hour (31 m.p.h.) had helped spread the flames.Hikmet Ozturk, a forestry expert with the Turkish Foundation for Combating Soil Erosion, a nongovernmental organization that works to protect forests, told CNN that while 95% of fires in Turkey are caused by people, the spread of the fires is worsened by climate change.The area of the fires are within the Mediterranean Basin which is one of the most susceptible to climate change risks, Ozturk said. ""Typical weather conditions in the summer for the area is hot and dry, which means the risk of fires is already high, and climate change raises that risk,"" he saidThe wildfires come as parts of western Europe have battle severe flooding in recent weeks. Scientists have for decades warned that climate change will make extreme weather events, including heavy rain and deadly flooding, more likely.CNN's Gul Tuysuz and Arwa Damon reported from Turkey. Sheena McKenzie wrote in London. CNN's Isil Sariyuce and Sharif Paget contributed to this report.

Foster a sense of community around people and earth at Yale, uniting networks of environmentalists as well as providing opportunities for students of all backgrounds to engage and share their perspectives on environmental issues. About Us: The Yale Student Environmental Coalition (YSEC) is the umbrella organization for student environmentalists and all student environmental groups in Yale College. Founded in 1986, YSEC strives to educate the Yale community about current environmental challenges and debates, advocating for environmentally conscious behavior, responsible consumer choice, sustainable university policy, and environmental justice.  We seek to partner with campus organizations, other colleges and universities, non-profits, and major international initiatives in order to bring our objectives to light at Yale, within New Haven, and around the world. Since 1986, the Yale Student Environmental Coalition and its constituent groups have built a genuine tradition of successful environmental initiatives. It was a YSEC report authored at the turn of the last century, “The Yale Green Plan,” which led to the creation of the Yale Office of Sustainability. The President of Yale University, Peter Salovey, has credited work of the Yale Student Environmental Coalition as being “very influential in helping to establish the kinds of sustainability policies and organized effort around sustainability that we see on campus today.” The Yale Student Environmental Coalition is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit, an observer NGO at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and an indispensable part of the Yale community. Over the years, YSEC has won multiple external awards for its work and its contributions to the global good. YSEC provides students with a network to all conceivable opportunities, facilities, and activities related to environment, at Yale and at large. We unite Yale undergraduates, bringing together those who share an understanding that environmental issues worldwide overarch many of the very greatest threats to political justice and economic prosperity.

These cover a wide range of issues, as shown below. These change over time and reflect the changing areas of local and global concern. If you have an idea for a new environmental initiative at Yale, or feel that you have a group deserving funding, please contact us for details on joining the coalition. Fossil Free Yale Project Bright Yale Bee Space Students for Carbon Dividends (S4CD) GREEN @ Yale EECO Fossil Free Yale Fossil Free Yale (FFY) is a grassroots student organization that fights to hold Yale accountable for its complicity in the climate crisis, demanding that Yale divest (sell their investments) immediately from fossil fuel companies and cancel its holdings in Puerto Rican debt. Recognizing that the planet and its most vulnerable people are actively suffering from the grave impacts of climate change, we leverage our power as students at Yale to join forces with the global struggle for climate justice. Building coalitions with Yale student organizations, alumni, professors, and New Haven activists, we use education, community-building, administrative engagement, protest, and direct action to fight for our precious future.

It is a member of the Yale Student Environmental Coalition, an umbrella organization for all Yale student environmental groups. Our name comes from the term “bee space” coined by Yale alum L. L. Langstroth, the inventor of the modern Langstroth beehive, to describe the natural spacing between honeycomb layers in a hive. We aim to educate students about the practice of beekeeping and lead workshops related to bees, honey and derived products. In addition to caring for farmed bees, we hope to raise awareness and appreciation of wild American bees.

We have generated an unprecedented coalition with student groups across the country, and we seek to mobilize students around this breakthrough climate solution.

We aim to catalyze change to reach the institution’s sustainability goals for 2025 as soon as possible. Although we are the youngest environmental club and started only in March 2018, we have many projects already in the works, such as the Sustainable Butteries project and Project Green Challenge outreach. The scale of our projects can be small (within a residential college) or large (New Haven wide), and whatever ideas we decide to pursue depends entirely on our members. Potential ideas include: running a program-return scheme with the Dramat, collaborating with New Haven businesses to institute a strawless campaign and bring-your-own (BYO) discount and many many more!

There is no central campus, rather university buildings are scattered around the city between shops, for example those at centre right of the picture. A college town or university town is a community (often a separate town or city, but in some cases a town/city neighborhood or a district) that is dominated by its university population. The university may be large, or there may be several smaller institutions such as liberal arts colleges clustered, or the residential population may be small, but college towns in all cases are so dubbed because the presence of the educational institution(s) pervades economic and social life. Many local residents may be employed by the university—which may be the largest employer in the community—many businesses cater primarily to the university, and the student population may outnumber the local population. Contents 1 Description 2 Town–gown relations 3 Settlement in college towns 4 See also 5 Notes 6 References Description[edit] Kuopio, North Savonia, home to the Savonia University of Applied Sciences In Europe, a university town is generally characterised by having an ancient university. The economy of the city is closely related with the university activity and highly supported by the entire university structure, which may include university hospitals and clinics, printing houses, libraries, laboratories, business incubators, student rooms, dining halls, students' unions, student societies, and academic festivities. Moreover, the history of the city is often intertwined with that of the university. Many European university towns have not been merely important places of science and education, but also centres of political, cultural and social influence throughout the centuries.[1] As an example of this, Paris also illustrates the course of educational history with the Sorbonne and the Grande école.[2] Besides a highly educated and largely transient population, a stereotypical college town often has many people in non-traditional lifestyles and subcultures and with a high tolerance for unconventionality in general, and has a very active musical or cultural scene. The majority of the population is usually politically liberal.[citation needed] Many have become centres of technological research and innovative startups. Universities with start-up centers can be large cities like Munich, but also small cities like Trieste.[3] Although the concept of a university town has developed since the European Middle Ages, equivalents already existed in earlier times and in non-European cultures. For example, in later Classical times the city of Athens – no longer having any political or military power, but renowned as the greatest center of learning in the Roman Empire – had many of the characteristics of a university town, and is sometimes called such by modern scholars. Town–gown relations[edit] Main article: Town and gown Ann Arbor, Michigan, home to the University of Michigan As in the case of a company town, the large and transient university population may come into conflict with other townspeople. Students may come from outside the area, and perhaps subscribe to a different—sometimes radically different—culture.[citation needed] Most students are young people, whose living habits may be different from older people. Economically, the high spending power of the university and of its students in aggregate may inflate the cost of living above that of the region. It is common for university employees to commute from surrounding areas, finding the cost of living in town too expensive.[citation needed] Studentification, in which a growing student population move in large numbers to traditionally non-student neighborhoods, may be perceived as a form of invasion or gentrification. It may be due to university enrollment expanding beyond the capacity of on-campus housing, inadequate zoning enforcement, and/or student culture. Neighborhood associations may work to limit conversion of family homes to student rentals, while some local residents may oppose the construction of large on-campus dormitories or expansion of fraternity and sorority houses, forcing a growing enrollment to seek housing in town. Moreover, a single-family home can be converted into several smaller rental units, or shared by a number of students whose combined resources exceed those of a typical single-family rental—a strong incentive for absentee landlords to cater to students.[citation needed] In the US, educational institutions are often exempted from local taxes, so in the absence of a system for payments in lieu of taxes, the university population will disproportionately burden parts of the local public infrastructure, such as roads or law enforcement. Some analysts argue that students relieve the burden on other parts of the local public infrastructure, such as local primary and secondary schools, by far the most costly line item in most North American city and town budgets, by providing tax revenues through local sales tax and property tax paid by landlords. When a university expands its facilities, the potential loss of property tax revenue is thus a concern, in addition to local desire to preserve open space or historic neighborhoods. As a result, local people may resent the university and its students.[citation needed] The students, in turn, may criticize the local residents' taking jobs at the university provided by student tuition and fees, and accepting the tax revenues (e.g. local sales tax, property tax on rented properties) that students generate, but resenting students' lifestyles. Some students refer to other inhabitants as ""townies"", a term with somewhat derogatory connotations. This ""town and gown"" dichotomy notwithstanding, students and the outside community typically find a peaceful (even friendly) coexistence, with the town receiving significant economic and cultural benefits from the university, and the students often adapting to the culture of the town.[citation needed] Settlement in college towns[edit] Claremont, California, home to the Claremont Colleges While noise, traffic, and other quality of life issues have not been resolved, some advocates of New Urbanism have led the development of neighborhoods in college towns by specifically capitalizing on their proximity to university life. For instance, some universities have developed properties to allow faculty and staff members to walk to work, reducing demand for limited on-campus parking; Duke University's Trinity Heights development is a key example. In many cases, developers have built communities where access to the university (even if not directly adjacent) is promoted as an advantage. Student housing is also an important component of college towns. In the United States most state universities have 50 percent or more of their enrolled students living off-campus. This trend, which began in the 1960s, originally meant the conversion of near campus single-family homes to student housing, creating ""student ghettos."" Cambridge, home to the University of Cambridge Colleges and other developers began building purpose-built off-campus student housing areas in the 1970s in more college towns. Beginning around 2000 in the United States, nationwide real estate investment trusts (REIT) and publicly traded corporations began developing student housing complexes. Another notable development since the 1990s is the surge in popularity of retirees relocating to college towns. Retirees are attracted to these locations because of cultural and educational opportunities, college athletic events, good medical facilities (often at teaching hospitals affiliated with medical schools), a low cost of living, and often a pedestrian- or public transit-friendly development pattern. Several development companies now specialize in constructing retirement communities in college towns. In some cases the communities have developed formal relationships with the local institution. The demand for housing from students, faculty, staff, and retirees has kept college town home prices stable during the housing market downturn that began in 2005.[4] See also[edit] List of college towns Student quarter Town and gown Company town Notes[edit] ^ Christian Cwik, Michael Zeuske ""Rettet die Unis und die Unistädte"", In: science-ORF 14 June 2020. ^ Pierre Bourdieu, Monique de Saint Martin, ""La Noblesse d’État.

Founded in 1701 as the Collegiate School, it is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine Colonial Colleges chartered before the American Revolution. The Collegiate School was renamed Yale College in 1718 to honor the school's largest private benefactor for the first century of its existence, Elihu Yale.[7][8] Yale University is referred to as a member of the Big Three (colleges), is consistently ranked as one of the top universities and is considered one of the most prestigious in the nation and in the world.[9][10][11][12] Chartered by Connecticut Colony, the Collegiate School was established in 1701 by clergy to educate Congregational ministers before moving to New Haven in 1716. Originally restricted to theology and sacred languages, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution. In the 19th century, the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first PhD in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887. Yale's faculty and student populations grew after 1890 with rapid expansion of the physical campus and scientific research. Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools. While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the university owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, a campus in West Haven, Connecticut, and forests and nature preserves throughout New England. As of June 2020, the university's endowment was valued at $31.1 billion, the second largest of any educational institution.[1] The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.[13][14] Students compete in intercollegiate sports as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I – Ivy League. As of October 2020, 65 Nobel laureates, five Fields Medalists, four Abel Prize laureates, and three Turing award winners have been affiliated with Yale University. In addition, Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five U.S. Presidents, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, 31 living billionaires,[15] and many heads of state. Hundreds of members of Congress and many U.S. diplomats, 78 MacArthur Fellows, 252 Rhodes Scholars, 123 Marshall Scholars, and nine Mitchell Scholars have been affiliated with the university.

(July 2021) Early history of Yale College[edit] Origins[edit] Charter creating the Collegiate School, which became Yale College, October 9, 1701 Yale traces its beginnings to ""An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School"", a would-be charter passed during a meeting in New Haven by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut on October 9, 1701. The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. Soon after, a group of ten Congregational ministers, Samuel Andrew, Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather (nephew of Increase Mather), Rev. James Noyes II (son of James Noyes), James Pierpont, Abraham Pierson, Noadiah Russell, Joseph Webb, and Timothy Woodbridge, all alumni of Harvard, met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell, located in Branford, Connecticut, to donate their books to form the school's library.[16] The group, led by James Pierpont, is now known as ""The Founders"".[17] A Front View of Yale-College and the College Chapel, printed by Daniel Bowen in 1786 From its origin it is known as the ""Collegiate School"", the institution opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson, who is today considered the first president of Yale. Pierson lived in Killingworth (now Clinton). The school moved to Saybrook and then Wethersfield. In 1716, it moved to New Haven, Connecticut. Meanwhile, there was a rift forming at Harvard between its sixth president, Increase Mather, and the rest of the Harvard clergy, whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in Church polity. The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not.[18] Rev. Jason Haven, the minister at the First Church and Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts had been considered for the presidency on account of his orthodox theology and for ""Neatness dignity and purity of Style [which] surpass those of all that have been mentioned,"" but was passed over due to his ""very Valetudinary and infirm State of Health.""[19] Naming and development[edit] Coat of arms of the family of Elihu Yale, after whom the university was named in 1718 In 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted the successful Boston born businessman Elihu Yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Elihu ""Eli"" Yale, who had made a fortune in Madras while working for the East India Company as the first president of Fort St. George (largely through secret contracts with Madras merchants that were illegal under Company policy[20]), donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than £560, a substantial sum of money at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to ""Yale College.""[21] The Welsh name Yale is the Anglicized spelling of the Iâl, which the family estate at Plas yn Iâl, near the village of Llandegla, was called. Meanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology at the time.[22] It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the ""new divinity."" In 1722 the Rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745 and while he attempted to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy, he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.[23] Founders' connections to the slave trade[edit] One of Elihu Yale's responsibilities as president of Fort St. George was overseeing its slave trade, though he himself was never a slave trader, never owned slaves, opposed the slave trade, and imposed several restrictions on it during his tenure.[24] Critics nonetheless argue that he benefited from the trade by having it as one of his responsibilities as president, despite not owning any of the traded human beings or profiting from their sales.[25] The controversy over Yale University being named to honor the slave trader Elihu Yale dates back to at least 1994. In 2007, Yale University removed a painting which shows Elihu Yale attended to by a child slave. At the time, Yale University stated that the issues with Elihu Yale had begun at least 13 years prior. Although Elihu Yale was the president of the East India Company, a Yale University spokesperson claimed that, ""...Elihu Yale did not support slavery...""[26] A 2017 Wall Street Journal opinion article also called for renaming Yale University.[27][28] Since 2016, Yale University has acknowledged that Elihu Yale was ""...involved [in] and profited from the slave trade.""[29] The controversy over Yale's name started anew in 2020 with a Yale Daily News post, ""Yale Has to Go!""[30] After years of protest, Yale University renamed Calhoun College as Hopper College in 2017. Calhoun College was named for a South Carolina slave owner and anti-abolitionist, Vice President John C. Calhoun.[31][32][33] Yale University also acquired a slave plantation to finance its graduate program.[34] Yale University has multiple other buildings named to honor slave owners, including Bishop George Berkeley, Timothy Dwight and Ezra Stiles.[35] Curriculum[edit] Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753 First diploma awarded by Yale College, granted to Nathaniel Chauncey in 1702 Yale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and is organized into a social system of residential colleges. Yale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period—the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment—due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents Thomas Clap and Ezra Stiles. They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, ""irrelevance"" of curricula, desperate need for endowment and disagreements with the Connecticut legislature.[36][37][page needed] Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for the study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the college from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. A 1746 graduate of Yale, Stiles came to the college with experience in education, having played an integral role in the founding of Brown University, in addition to having been a minister.[38] Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the college. However, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning, Secretary to the British General in command of the occupation, intervened and the college was saved. In 1803, Fanning was granted an honorary degree LL.D. for his efforts.[39] Students[edit] As the only college in Connecticut from 1701 to 1823, Yale educated the sons of the elite.[40] Punishable offenses for students included cardplaying, tavern-going, destruction of college property, and acts of disobedience to college authorities. During this period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side.[41] The emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such organizations were debating societies: Crotonia in 1738, Linonia in 1753 and Brothers in Unity in 1768. While the societies no longer exist, commemorations to them can be found with names given to campus structures, like Brothers in Unity Courtyard in Branford College. 19th century[edit] Old Brick Row in 1807 The Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. During this period, all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track curriculum. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because it was difficult for an institution to be completely modern or completely classical.[42][43] A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a person possessed of religious values strong enough to sufficiently resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without.[44][page needed] William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms of students. Sumner bested President Noah Porter, who disliked the social sciences and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. Porter objected to Sumner's use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students.[45] Until 1887, the legal name of the university was ""The President and Fellows of Yale College, in New Haven."" In 1887, under an act passed by the Connecticut General Assembly, Yale was renamed to the present ""Yale University.""[46] Sports and debate[edit] The Revolutionary War soldier Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the archetype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who ""regretted"" that he ""had but one life to lose"" for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in the combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied this same heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel Stover at Yale (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, the alumni, and the team itself.[47] Yale's four-oared crew team posing with the 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy, won in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Along with Harvard and Princeton, Yale students rejected British concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football.[48][page needed] The Harvard–Yale football rivalry began in 1875. Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates,[49][page needed] and in 1909 (the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale and Princeton) the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There were also rallies to send off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.[50] In 1909–10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905–06, which sought to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. Presidents Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate reforms to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. While the big three had attempted to operate independently of the majority, the changes pushed did reduce injuries.[51] Expansion[edit] Starting with the addition of the Yale School of Medicine in 1810, the college expanded gradually from then on, establishing the Yale Divinity School in 1822, Yale Law School in 1822, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1847, the now-defunct Sheffield Scientific School in 1847,[52] and the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1869. In 1887, under the presidency of Timothy Dwight V, Yale College was renamed to Yale University, and the former name was subsequently applied only to the undergraduate college. The university would continue to expand greatly into the 20th and 21st century, adding the Yale School of Music in 1894, the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies in 1900, the Yale School of Public Health in 1915, the Yale School of Architecture in 1916, the Yale School of Nursing 1923, the Yale School of Drama in 1955, the Yale School of Management in 1976, and the Jackson School of Global Affairs which is planned to open in 2022.[53] The Sheffield Scientific School would also reorganize its relationship with the university to teach only undergraduate courses. Expansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. Noah Porter, a moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership.[citation needed] Historian George Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.[54][page needed] Levesque continues, saying he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. Levesque concludes, mention how he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university. 20th century[edit] Medicine[edit] Woolsey Hall c. 1905 Milton Winternitz led the Yale School of Medicine as its dean from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about ""social medicine"" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the ""Yale System"" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the Psychiatry Department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to resign.[55] Faculty[edit] Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor of the Yale campus facing northBefore World War II, most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions.[56] Almost all members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—and some members of other faculties—teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually.[57] Women[edit] In 1793, Lucinda Foote passed the entrance exams for Yale College, but was rejected by the President on the basis of her gender.[58] Women studied at Yale University as early as 1892, in graduate-level programs at the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[59] In 1966, Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female and part of the Seven Sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the Ivy League when most Ivy League institutions still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969.[60] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate;[61] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall. The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year;[62] at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall at the south end of Old Campus.[63] A decade into co-education, student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit Alexander v. Yale. In the late 1970s, a group of students and one faculty member sued Yale for its failure to curtail campus sexual harassment by especially male faculty. The case was party built from a 1977 report authored by plaintiff Ann Olivarius, now a feminist attorney known for fighting sexual harassment, ""A report to the Yale Corporation from the Yale Undergraduate Women's Caucus.""[64] This case was the first to use Title IX to argue and establish that the sexual harassment of female students can be considered illegal sex discrimination. The plaintiffs in the case were Olivarius, Ronni Alexander (now a professor at Kobe University, Japan), Margery Reifler (works in the Los Angeles film industry), Pamela Price (civil rights attorney in California), and Lisa E. Stone (works at Anti-Defamation League). They were joined by Yale classics professor John “Jack” J. Winkler, who died in 1990. The lawsuit, brought partly by Catharine MacKinnon, alleged rape, fondling, and offers of higher grades for sex by several Yale faculty, including Keith Brion, professor of flute and Director of Bands, Political Science professor Raymond Duvall (now at the University of Minnesota), English professor Michael Cooke, and coach of the field hockey team, Richard Kentwell. While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale's Grievance Board and the Yale Women's Center.[65] In March 2011 a Title IX complaint was filed against Yale by students and recent graduates, including editors of Yale's feminist magazine Broad Recognition, alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate.[66] In response, the university formed a Title IX steering committee to address complaints of sexual misconduct.[67] Afterwards, universities and colleges throughout the US also established sexual harassment grievance procedures. Class[edit] Yale, like other Ivy League schools, instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to maintain the proportion of white Protestants from notable families in the student body (see numerus clausus), and was one of the last of the Ivies to eliminate such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970.[68] 21st century[edit] In 2006, Yale and Peking University (PKU) established a Joint Undergraduate Program in Beijing, an exchange program allowing Yale students to spend a semester living and studying with PKU honor students.[69] In July 2012, the Yale University-PKU Program ended due to weak participation.[69] In 2007 outgoing Yale President Rick Levin characterized Yale's institutional priorities: ""First, among the nation's finest research universities, Yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education. Second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in Yale College, we are committed to the education of leaders.""[70] In 2009, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair picked Yale as one location – the others being Britain's Durham University and Universiti Teknologi Mara – for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation's United States Faith and Globalization Initiative.[71] As of 2009, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is the director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar, ""Debating Globalization"".[72] As of 2009, former presidential candidate and DNC chair Howard Dean teaches a residential college seminar, ""Understanding Politics and Politicians"".[73] Also in 2009, an alliance was formed among Yale, University College London, and both schools' affiliated hospital complexes to conduct research focused on the direct improvement of patient care—a growing field known as translational medicine. President Richard Levin noted that Yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world, but ""no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with UCL"".[74] In August 2013, a new partnership with the National University of Singapore led to the opening of Yale-NUS College in Singapore, a joint effort to create a new liberal arts college in Asia featuring a curriculum including both Western and Asian traditions.[75] In 2020, in the wake of protests around the world focused on racial relations and criminal justice reform, the #CancelYale tag was used on social media to demand that Elihu Yale's name be removed from Yale University. Most support for the change stemmed from politically conservative pundits, such as Mike Cernovich and Ann Coulter, satirizing perceived excesses of online cancel culture.[76] Yale was president of the East India Company, a trading company that traded slaves as well as goods, [77] and his singularly large donation[78][79] led to Yale relying on money from the slave-trade for its first scholarships and endowments.[25][80] In August 2020, the US Justice Department claimed that Yale discriminated against Asian and white candidates on the basis of their race. The university, however, denied the report.[81] In early February 2021, under the new Biden administration, the Justice Department withdrew the lawsuit. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, known for a similar lawsuit against Harvard alleging the same issue, plans to refile the lawsuit.[82] Yale alumni in politics[edit] The Boston Globe wrote that ""if there's one school that can lay claim to educating the nation's top national leaders over the past three decades, it's Yale"".[83][verification needed] Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. presidential election between 1972 and 2004.[84] Yale-educated Presidents since the end of the Vietnam War include Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, and major-party nominees during this period include Hillary Clinton (2016), John Kerry (2004), Joseph Lieberman (Vice President, 2000), and Sargent Shriver (Vice President, 1972). Other Yale alumni who have made serious bids for the Presidency during this period include Amy Klobuchar (2020), Tom Steyer (2020), Ben Carson (2016), Howard Dean (2004), Gary Hart (1984 and 1988), Paul Tsongas (1992), Pat Robertson (1988) and Jerry Brown (1976, 1980, 1992). Several explanations have been offered for Yale's representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates.[85][verification needed] Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale's focus on creating ""a laboratory for future leaders,"" an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster.[85] Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: ""We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale.""[83] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes ""an ethos of organized activity"" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News.[86] Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: ""It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school.""[87] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the ""son and grandson of alumni"", and for a ""member of a politically influential family"".[88] New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and The Atlantic Monthly correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others.[89] During the 1988 presidential election, George H. W. Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis for having ""foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique"". When challenged on the distinction between Dukakis' Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was ""so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it"" and said Yale did not share Harvard's reputation for ""liberalism and elitism"".[90] In 2004 Howard Dean stated, ""In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of '68 and the class of '71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation"".[89] Administration and organization[edit] Leadership[edit] School founding School Year founded Yale College 1701 Yale School of Medicine 1810 Yale Divinity School 1822 Yale Law School 1843 Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences 1847 Sheffield Scientific School[52] 1847 Yale School of Fine Arts 1869 Yale School of Music 1894 Yale School of the Environment 1900 Yale School of Public Health 1915 Yale School of Architecture 1916 Yale School of Nursing 1923 David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University 1955 Yale School of Management 1976 Jackson School of Global Affairs Planned for fall 2022[53] The President and Fellows of Yale College, also known as the Yale Corporation, or board of trustees, is the governing body of the university and consists of thirteen standing committees with separate responsibilities outlined in the by-laws. The corporation has 19 members: three ex officio members, ten successor trustees, and six elected alumni fellows.[91] The university has three major academic components: Yale College (the undergraduate program), the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the twelve professional schools.[92] Yale's former president Richard C. Levin was, at the time, one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million.[93] Yale's succeeding president Peter Salovey ranks 40th with a 2020 salary of $1.16 million.[94] The Yale Provost's Office and similar executive positions have launched several women into prominent university executive positions. In 1977, Provost Hanna Holborn Gray was appointed interim President of Yale and later went on to become President of the University of Chicago, being the first woman to hold either position at each respective school.[95][96] In 1994, Provost Judith Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution at the University of Pennsylvania.[97] In 2002, Provost Alison Richard became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge.[98] In 2003, the Dean of the Divinity School, Rebecca Chopp, was appointed president of Colgate University and later went on to serve as the President of the Swarthmore College in 2009, and then the first female chancellor of the University of Denver in 2014.[99] In 2004, Provost Dr. Susan Hockfield became the President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[100] In 2004, Dean of the Nursing school, Catherine Gilliss, was appointed the Dean of Duke University's School of Nursing and Vice Chancellor for Nursing Affairs.[101] In 2007, Deputy Provost H. Kim Bottomly was named President of Wellesley College.[102] Similar examples for men who've served in Yale leadership positions can also be found. In 2004, Dean of Yale College Richard H. Brodhead was appointed as the President of Duke University.[103] In 2008, Provost Andrew Hamilton was confirmed to be the Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford.[104] Staff and labor unions[edit] See also: Federation of Hospital and University Employees Yale University staff are represented by several different unions. Clerical and technical workers are represented by Local 34, and service and maintenance workers are represented by Local 35, both of the same union affiliate UNITE HERE.[105] Unlike similar institutions, Yale has consistently refused to recognize its graduate student union, Local 33 (another affiliate of UNITE HERE), citing claims that the union's elections were undemocratic and how graduate students are not employees;[106][107] the move to not recognize the union has been criticized by the American Federation of Teachers.[108] In addition, officers of the Yale University Police Department are represented by the Yale Police Benevolent Association, which affiliated in 2005 with the Connecticut Organization for Public Safety Employees.[105][109] Yale security officers joined the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America in late 2010,[110] even though the Yale administration contested the election.[111] In October 2014, after deliberation,[112] Yale security decided to form a new union, the Yale University Security Officers Association, which has since represented the campus security officers.[105][113] Yale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations, often culminating in strikes.[114][page needed] There have been at least eight strikes since 1968, and The New York Times wrote that Yale has a reputation as having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the U.S.[115] Moreover, Yale has been accused by the AFL–CIO of failing to treat workers with respect,[116] as well as not renewing contracts with professors over involvement in campus labor issues.[117] Yale has responded to strikes with claims over mediocre union participation and the benefits of their contracts.[118] Campus[edit] Yale Law School, located in the Sterling Law Building Interior of Beinecke Library Yale's central campus in downtown New Haven covers 260 acres (1.1 km2) and comprises its main, historic campus and a medical campus adjacent to the Yale–New Haven Hospital. In western New Haven, the university holds 500 acres (2.0 km2) of athletic facilities, including the Yale Golf Course.[119] In 2008, Yale purchased the 17-building, 136-acre (0.55 km2) former Bayer HealthCare complex in West Haven, Connecticut,[120] the buildings of which are now used as laboratory and research space.[121] Yale also owns seven forests in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire—the largest of which is the 7,840-acre (31.7 km2) Yale-Myers Forest in Connecticut's Quiet Corner—and nature preserves including Horse Island.[122] Yale is noted for its largely Collegiate Gothic campus[123] as well as several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: Louis Kahn's Yale Art Gallery[124] and Center for British Art, Eero Saarinen's Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph's Art & Architecture Building. Yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along Hillhouse Avenue, which was considered the most beautiful street in America by Charles Dickens when he visited the United States in the 1840s.[125] In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the Yale campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States.[126] Many of Yale's buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness, including the Yale Drama School.[127][128] Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities, such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes, like a policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid,[129] deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, 216 feet (66 m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon Statue of Nathan Hale in front of Connecticut Hall Vanderbilt Hall Other examples of the Gothic style are on the Old Campus by architects like Henry Austin, Charles C. Haight and Russell Sturgis. Several are associated with members of the Vanderbilt family, including Vanderbilt Hall,[130] Phelps Hall,[131] St. Anthony Hall (a commission for member Frederick William Vanderbilt), the Mason, Sloane and Osborn laboratories, dormitories for the Sheffield Scientific School (the engineering and sciences school at Yale until 1956) and elements of Silliman College, the largest residential college.[132] The oldest building on campus, Connecticut Hall (built in 1750), is in the Georgian style. Georgian-style buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include Timothy Dwight College, Pierson College, and Davenport College, except the latter's east, York Street façade, which was constructed in the Gothic style to coordinate with adjacent structures. The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books and manuscripts. The library includes a six-story above-ground tower of book stacks, filled with 180,000 volumes, that is surrounded by large translucent Vermont marble panels and a steel and granite truss. The panels act as windows and subdue direct sunlight while also diffusing the light in warm hues throughout the interior.[133] Near the library is a sunken courtyard, with sculptures by Isamu Noguchi that are said to represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube).[134] The library is located near the center of the university in Hewitt Quadrangle, which is now more commonly referred to as ""Beinecke Plaza."" Alumnus Eero Saarinen, Finnish-American architect of such notable structures as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Washington Dulles International Airport main terminal, Bell Labs Holmdel Complex and the CBS Building in Manhattan, designed Ingalls Rink, dedicated in 1959,[135] as well as the residential colleges Ezra Stiles and Morse.[136] These latter were modeled after the medieval Italian hill town of San Gimignano – a prototype chosen for the town's pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone towers.[137] These tower forms at Yale act in counterpoint to the college's many Gothic spires and Georgian cupolas.[138] Yale's Old Campus at dusk, April 2013 Notable nonresidential campus buildings[edit] Harkness Tower Notable nonresidential campus buildings and landmarks include Battell Chapel, Beinecke Rare Book Library, Harkness Tower, Ingalls Rink, Kline Biology Tower, Osborne Memorial Laboratories, Payne Whitney Gymnasium, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Sterling Hall of Medicine, Sterling Law Buildings, Sterling Memorial Library, Woolsey Hall, Yale Center for British Art, Yale University Art Gallery, Yale Art & Architecture Building, and the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art in London. Yale's secret society buildings (some of which are called ""tombs"") were built both to be private yet unmistakable. A diversity of architectural styles is represented: Berzelius, Donn Barber in an austere cube with classical detailing (erected in 1908 or 1910); Book and Snake, Louis R. Metcalfe in a Greek Ionic style (erected in 1901); Elihu, architect unknown but built in a Colonial style (constructed on an early 17th-century foundation although the building is from the 18th century); Mace and Chain, in a late colonial, early Victorian style (built in 1823). (Interior moulding is said to have belonged to Benedict Arnold);Manuscript Society, King Lui-Wu with Dan Kniley responsible for landscaping and Josef Albers for the brickwork intaglio mural. Building constructed in a mid-century modern style; Scroll and Key, Richard Morris Hunt in a Moorish- or Islamic-inspired Beaux-Arts style (erected 1869–70); Skull and Bones, possibly Alexander Jackson Davis or Henry Austin in an Egypto-Doric style utilizing Brownstone (in 1856 the first wing was completed, in 1903 the second wing, 1911 the Neo-Gothic towers in rear garden were completed); St. Elmo, (former tomb) Kenneth M. Murchison, 1912, designs inspired by Elizabethan manor. Current location, brick colonial; and Wolf's Head, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, erected 1923–1924, Collegiate Gothic. Sustainability[edit] Yale's Office of Sustainability develops and implements sustainability practices at Yale.[139] Yale is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10% below 1990 levels by the year 2020. As part of this commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by residential colleges.[140] Eleven campus buildings are candidates for LEED design and certification.[141] Yale Sustainable Food Project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all residential college dining halls.[142] Yale was listed as a Campus Sustainability Leader on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2008, and received a ""B+"" grade overall.[143] Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven Marsh Botanical Garden Yale Sustainable Food Program Farm Relationship with New Haven[edit] Yale is the largest taxpayer and employer in the City of New Haven,[144] and has often buoyed the city's economy and communities. Yale, however has consistently opposed paying a tax on its academic property.[145] Yale's Art Galleries, along with many other university resources, are free and openly accessible. Yale also funds the New Haven Promise program, paying full tuition for eligible students from New Haven public schools.[146] Town–gown relations[edit] Yale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.[147] Campus safety[edit] Several campus safety strategies have been pioneered at Yale. The first campus police force was founded at Yale in 1894, when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus.[148][149] Later hired by the university, the officers were originally brought in to quell unrest between students and city residents and curb destructive student behavior.[150][151] In addition to the Yale Police Department, a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a safety escort, and 24-hour shuttle service. In the 1970s and 1980s, poverty and violent crime rose in New Haven, dampening Yale's student and faculty recruiting efforts.[152] Between 1990 and 2006, New Haven's crime rate fell by half, helped by a community policing strategy by the New Haven Police and Yale's campus became the safest among the Ivy League and other peer schools.[153] In 2004, the national non-profit watchdog group Security on Campus filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, accusing Yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults.[154][155] In April 2021, Yale announced that it will require students to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of being on campus during the fall 2021 term.[156] Academics[edit] Admissions[edit] Admissions statistics2020 enteringclass[157]Change vs.2015[158]Admit rate6.5% ( −0.2)Yield rate54.9% ( −12)Test scores middle 50%SAT EBRW720–780SAT Math740–800ACT Composite33–35High school GPATop 10%†94% ( −3)†Among students whose school ranked Undergraduate admission to Yale College is considered ""most selective"" by U.S. News.[159][160] In 2017, Yale accepted 2,285 students to the Class of 2021 out of 32,914 applicants, for an acceptance rate of 6.9%.[161] 98% of students graduate within six years.[162] Through its program of need-based financial aid, Yale commits to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants. Most financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not need to be paid back to the university, and the average need-based aid grant for the Class of 2017 was $46,395.[163] 15% of Yale College students are expected to have no parental contribution, and about 50% receive some form of financial aid.[162][164][165] About 16% of the Class of 2013 had some form of student loan debt at graduation, with an average debt of $13,000 among borrowers.[162] Half of all Yale undergraduates are women, more than 39% are ethnic minority U.S. citizens (19% are underrepresented minorities), and 10.5% are international students.[163] 55% attended public schools and 45% attended private, religious, or international schools, and 97% of students were in the top 10% of their high school class.[162] Every year, Yale College also admits a small group of non-traditional students through the Eli Whitney Students Program. Collections[edit] Yale University's Sterling Memorial Library, as seen from Maya Lin's sculpture, Women's Table. The sculpture records the number of women enrolled at Yale over its history; female undergraduates were not admitted until 1969. Yale University Library, which holds over 15 million volumes, is the third-largest university collection in the United States.[13][166] The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject libraries. Rare books are found in several Yale collections. The Beinecke Rare Book Library has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The Lewis Walpole Library contains the largest collection of 18th‑century British literary works. The Elizabethan Club, technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale. The Night Café, Vincent van Gogh, 1888, Yale Art Gallery Yale's museum collections are also of international stature. The Yale University Art Gallery, the country's first university-affiliated art museum, contains more than 200,000 works, including Old Masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartwout and Kahn buildings. The latter, Louis Kahn's first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The Yale Center for British Art, the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of Paul Mellon and is housed in another Kahn-designed building. The Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments, affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of Yale's collections because its hours of opening are restricted. The museums once housed the artifacts brought to the United States from Peru by Yale history professor Hiram Bingham in his Yale-financed expedition to Machu Picchu in 1912 – when the removal of such artifacts was legal. The artifacts were restored to Peru in 2012.[167] Academic rankings National ARWU[168] 9 Forbes[169] 3 THE/WSJ[170] 3 U.S. News & World Report[171] 4 Washington Monthly[172] 4 Global ARWU[173] 11 QS[174] 14 THE[175] 8 U.S. News & World Report[176] 11 USNWR graduate school rankings[177] Business 9 Engineering 39 Law 1 Medicine: Primary Care 49 Medicine: Research 15 Nursing: Doctorate 17 Nursing: Master's 14 Rankings[edit] USNWR departmental rankings[177] Biological Sciences 6 Chemistry 9 Clinical Psychology 18 Computer Science 20 Earth Sciences 13 Economics 1 English 8 Fine Arts 2 History 1 Mathematics 9 Nursing–Midwifery 2 Physician Assistant 26 Physics 12 Political Science 4 Psychology 3 Public Health 15 Sociology 22 Statistics 31 The U.S. News & World Report ranked Yale 3rd among U.S. national universities for 2016,[159] as it had for each of the previous sixteen years.

(March 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Yale is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) and is classified among ""R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity"".[184] According to the National Science Foundation, Yale spent $990 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 15th in the nation.[185] Yale's faculty include 61 members of the National Academy of Sciences,[186] 7 members of the National Academy of Engineering[187] and 49 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The college is, after normalization for institution size, the tenth-largest baccalaureate source of doctoral degree recipients in the United States, and the largest such source within the Ivy League.[188] Yale's English and Comparative Literature departments were part of the New Criticism movement. Of the New Critics, Robert Penn Warren, W.K. Wimsatt, and Cleanth Brooks were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American deconstruction. Jacques Derrida, the father of deconstruction, taught at the Department of Comparative Literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called ""Yale School"". These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C. Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, David Montgomery, a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th century. The Journal of Music Theory was founded there in 1957; Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and scholars. In addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 Postdocs from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the Yale Postdoctoral Association. Campus life[edit] Yale is a research university, with the majority of its students in the graduate and professional schools. Undergraduates, or Yale College students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010–2011 freshman class, 10% are non‑U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.[189] The median family income of Yale students is $192,600, with 57% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 16% from the bottom 60%.[190] Residential colleges[edit] Main article: Residential colleges of Yale University Yale's residential college system was established in 1933 by Edward S. Harkness, who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as ""Master's Teas,"" but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college. All undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.[191] While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the Old Campus, the university's oldest precinct. While Harkness' original colleges were Georgian Revival or Collegiate Gothic in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history. In 2017, the university opened two new colleges near Science Hill.[192] Jonathan Edwards College courtyard Branford College courtyard Saybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard Hopper College courtyard Berkeley College buildings Trumbull College courtyard Davenport College courtyard Pierson College courtyard Silliman College courtyard Timothy Dwight College courtyard Morse College courtyard Ezra Stiles College courtyard Benjamin Franklin College courtyard Pauli Murray College courtyard Calhoun College[edit] Since the 1960s, John C. Calhoun's white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership[193][194][195][196] had prompted calls to rename the college or remove its tributes to Calhoun. The racially motivated church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, led to renewed calls in the summer of 2015 for Calhoun College, one of 12 residential colleges, to be renamed. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change.[194] They argued in the petition that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an ""extraordinary American statesman""—he was ""one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy"" in the history of the United States.[194][195] In August 2015 Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed.[196] He described Calhoun as ""a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina"".[196] He acknowledged that Calhoun also ""believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude. Not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests.""[193] Student activism about this issue increased in the fall of 2015, and included further protests sparked by controversy surrounding an administrator's comments on the potential positive and negative implications of students who wear Halloween costumes that are culturally sensitive.[197] Campus-wide discussions expanded to include critical discussion of the experiences of women of color on campus, and the realities of racism in undergraduate life.[198] The protests were sensationalized by the media and led to the labelling of some students as being members of Generation Snowflake.[199] In April 2016 Salovey announced that ""despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests,"" Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college[200] explaining that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun's ""shadow"" so they will be ""better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future"". He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would ""obscure"" his ""legacy of slavery rather than addressing it"".[200] ""Yale is part of that history"" and ""We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it."" One change that will be issued is the title of ""master"" for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to ""head of college"" due to its connotation of slavery.[201] Despite this apparently conclusive reasoning, Salovey announced that Calhoun College would be renamed for groundbreaking computer scientist Grace Murray Hopper in February 2017.[202] This renaming decision received a range of responses from Yale students and alumni.[203][204][205] Student organizations[edit] In 2014, Yale had 385 registered student organizations, plus an additional one hundred groups in the process of registration.[206] The university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. Established in 1872, The Yale Record is the world's oldest humor magazine. Newspapers include the Yale Daily News, which was first published in 1878, and the weekly Yale Herald, which was first published in 1986. The Yale Journal of Medicine & Law is a biannual magazine that explores the intersection of law and medicine. Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in New Haven. The Yale College Council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. The Yale Dramatic Association and Bulldog Productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. In addition, the Yale Drama Coalition[207] serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio[208] is the campus's radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM and FM frequencies, they now have an Internet-only stream. The Yale College Council (YCC) serves as the campus's undergraduate student government. All registered student organizations are regulated and funded by a subsidiary organization of the YCC, known as the Undergraduate Organizations Funding Committee (UOFC).[209] The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) serves as Yale's graduate and professional student government. The Yale Political Union is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry and George Pataki. The Yale International Relations Association (YIRA) functions as the umbrella organization for the top-ranked Model UN team. YIRA also has a Europe-based offshoot, Yale Model Government Europe, other Model UN conferences such as YMUN Korea or YMUN Taiwan, and educational programs such as the Yale Review of International Relations (YRIS), YMUN Institute, or Hemispheres. The campus includes several fraternities and sororities. The campus features at least 18 a cappella groups, the most famous of which is The Whiffenpoofs, which from its founding in 1909 until 2018 was made up solely of senior men. Yale's secret societies include Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, Wolf's Head, Book and Snake, Elihu, Berzelius, St. Elmo, Manuscript, Shabtai, Myth and Sword, Mace and Chain and Sage and Chalice. The two oldest existing honor societies are the Aurelian (1910) and the Torch Honor Society (1916).[210] The Elizabethan Club, a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. Membership is by invitation. Members and their guests may enter the ""Lizzie's"" premises for conversation and tea. The club owns first editions of a Shakespeare Folio, several Shakespeare Quartos, and a first edition of Milton's Paradise Lost, among other important literary texts. Traditions[edit] See also: Bladderball Yale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their ""bright college years,"" though in recent history the pipes have been replaced with ""bubble pipes"".[211][212] (""Bright College Years,"" the university's alma mater, was penned in 1881 by Henry Durand, Class of 1881, to the tune of Die Wacht am Rhein.) Yale's student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus; however, actual students rarely do so.[213] In the second half of the 20th century Bladderball, a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009, 2011, and 2014.[214][215][216] Athletic[edit] Main article: Yale Bulldogs The Yale Bowl, the college football stadium located near Yale University Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference, the Eastern College Athletic Conference, the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association. Yale athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the NCAA Division I level. Like other members of the Ivy League, Yale does not offer athletic scholarships. Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Yale Bowl (the nation's first natural ""bowl"" stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl), located at The Walter Camp Field athletic complex, and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world.[217] In May 2018, the men's lacrosse team defeated the Duke Blue Devils to claim their first ever NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship,[218] and are the first Ivy League school to win the title since the Princeton Tigers in 2001.[219] In 2016, the men's basketball team won the Ivy League Championship title for the first time in 54 years, earning a spot in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In the first round of the tournament, the Bulldogs beat the Baylor Bears 79–75 in the school's first-ever tournament win.[220] The Walter Camp Gate at the Yale Athletic Complex October 21, 2000, marked the dedication of Yale's fourth new boathouse in 157 years of collegiate rowing. The Gilder Boathouse is named to honor former Olympic rower Virginia Gilder '79 and her father Richard Gilder '54, who gave $4 million towards the $7.5 million project. Yale also maintains the Gales Ferry site where the heavyweight men's team trains for the Yale-Harvard Boat Race. Yale crew is the oldest collegiate athletic team in America, and won Olympic Games Gold Medal for men's eights in 1924 and 1956. The Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate sailing club in the world. In 1896, Yale and Johns Hopkins played the first known ice hockey game in the United States. Since 2006, the school's ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game.[221] Yale students claim to have invented Frisbee, by tossing empty Frisbie Pie Company tins.[222][223] Yale athletics are supported by the Yale Precision Marching Band. ""Precision"" is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching.[224] The band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter. Yale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about ten different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup. Song[edit] Notable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement, convocation, alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, ""Bright College Years"". Despite its popularity, ""Boola Boola"" is not the official fight song, albeit being the origin of the university's unofficial motto. The official Yale fight song, ""Bulldog"" was written by Cole Porter during his undergraduate days and is sung after touchdowns during a football game.[225] Additionally, two other songs, ""Down the Field"" by C.W. O'Conner, and ""Bingo Eli Yale"", also by Cole Porter, are still sung at football games. According to College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology published in 1998, ""Down the Field"" ranks as the fourth-greatest fight song of all time.[226] Mascot[edit] The school mascot is ""Handsome Dan,"" the Yale bulldog, and the Yale fight song contains the refrain, ""Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow"". The school color, since 1894, is Yale Blue.[227] Yale's Handsome Dan is believed to be the first college mascot in America, having been established in 1889.[228] Notable people[edit] Benefactors[edit] Yale has had many financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. Among those who have made large donations commemorated at the university are: Elihu Yale; Jeremiah Dummer; the Harkness family (Edward, Anna, and William); the Beinecke family (Edwin, Frederick, and Walter); John William Sterling; Payne Whitney; Joseph Earl Sheffield, Paul Mellon, Charles B. G. Murphy, Joseph Tsai, and William K. Lanman. The Yale Class of 1954, led by Richard Gilder, donated $70 million in commemoration of their 50th reunion.[229] Charles B. Johnson, a 1954 graduate of Yale College, pledged a $250 million gift in 2013 to support the construction of two new residential colleges.[230] The colleges have been named respectively in honor of Pauli Murray and Benjamin Franklin. A $100 million contribution[231] by Stephen Adams enabled the Yale School of Music to become tuition-free and the Adams Center for Musical Arts to be built.

(July 2021) President and Chief Justice William Howard Taft graduated from Yale in 1878. Over its history, Yale has produced many distinguished alumni in a variety of fields, ranging from the public to private sector. According to 2020 data, around 71% of undergraduates join the workforce, while the next largest majority of 16.6% go on to attend graduate or professional schools.[232] Yale graduates have been recipients of 252 Rhodes Scholarships,[233] 123 Marshall Scholarships,[234] 67 Truman Scholarships,[235] 21 Churchill Scholarships,[236] and 9 Mitchell Scholarships.[237] The university is also the second largest producer of Fulbright Scholars, with a total of 1,199 in its history[238] and has produced 89 MacArthur Fellows.[239] The U.S. Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs ranked Yale fifth among research institutions producing the most 2020–2021 Fulbright Scholars.[240] Additionally, 31 living billionaires are Yale alumni.[15] At Yale, one of the most popular undergraduate majors among Juniors and Seniors is political science, with many students going on to serve careers in government and politics.[241] Former presidents who attended Yale for undergrad include William Howard Taft, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush while former presidents Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton attended Yale Law School.[242] Former vice-president and influential antebellum era politician John C. Calhoun[243] also graduated from Yale. Former world leaders include Italian prime minister Mario Monti,[244] Turkish prime minister Tansu Çiller,[245] Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo,[246] German president Karl Carstens,[247] Philippine president José Paciano Laurel,[248] Latvian president Valdis Zatlers,[249] Taiwanese premier Jiang Yi-huah,[250] and Malawian president Peter Mutharika,[251] among others. Prominent royals who graduated are Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden,[252] and Olympia Bonaparte, Princess Napoléon.[253] Actress and director Jodie Foster graduated from Yale magna cum laude in 1985. Yale alumni have had considerable presence in U.S. government in all three branches. On the U.S. Supreme Court, 19 justices have been Yale alumni, including current Associate Justices Sonia Sotomayor,[254] Samuel Alito,[255] Clarence Thomas,[255] and Brett Kavanaugh.[256] Numerous Yale alumni have been U.S. Senators, including current Senators Michael Bennet,[257] Richard Blumenthal,[258] Cory Booker,[259] Sherrod Brown,[260] Chris Coons,[261] Amy Klobuchar,[262] Ben Sasse,[263] and Sheldon Whitehouse.[264] Current and former cabinet members include Secretaries of State John Kerry,[265] Hillary Clinton,[266] Cyrus Vance,[267] and Dean Acheson;[268] U.S. Secretaries of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott,[269] Robert Rubin,[270] Nicholas F. Brady,[271] Steven Mnuchin,[272] and Janet Yellen;[273] U.S. Attorney Generals Nicholas Katzenbach,[274] John Ashcroft,[275] and Edward H. Levi;[276] and many others. Peace Corps founder and American diplomat Sargent Shriver[277] and public official and urban planner Robert Moses[278] are Yale alumni. Economist and Nobel Prize laureate Paul Krugman graduated from Yale summa cum laude in 1974.Yale has produced numerous award-winning authors and influential writers,[279] like Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Sinclair Lewis[280] and Pulitzer Prize winners Stephen Vincent Benét,[281] Thornton Wilder,[282] Doug Wright,[283] and David McCullough.[284] Academy Award winning actors, actresses, and directors include Jodie Foster,[285] Paul Newman,[286] Meryl Streep,[287] Elia Kazan,[288] George Roy Hill,[289] Lupita Nyong'o,[290] Oliver Stone,[291] and Frances McDormand.[292] Alumni from Yale have also made notable contributions to both music and the arts.

In fiction and popular culture[edit] Further information: List of Yale University people and Yale University in popular culture Yale University, as one of the oldest universities in the United States, is a cultural referent as an institution that produces some of the most elite members of society[362] and its grounds, alumni, and students have been prominently portrayed in fiction and U.S. popular culture. For example, Owen Johnson's novel Stover at Yale follows the college career of Dink Stover,[363] and Frank Merriwell, the model for all later juvenile sports fiction, plays football, baseball, crew, and track at Yale while solving mysteries and righting wrongs.[364][365] Yale University also is mentioned in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby. The narrator, Nick Carraway, wrote a series of editorials for the Yale News, and Tom Buchanan was ""one of the most powerful ends that ever played football"" for Yale. In the popular TV show The Simpsons, Mr. Burns is a Yale alumnus. References[edit] ^ a b ""Yale University Financial Report 2019-2020"" (PDF). Yale University. 2020.

So-called “public Ivies” such as University of Michigan and Berkeley were not considered elite or even prestigious in the minds of evaluators (in contrast, these “state schools” were frequently described pejoratively as “safety schools” that were “just okay”). Even Ivy League designation was insufficient for inclusion in the super-elite. For undergraduate institutions, “top-tier” typically included only Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Stanford, and potentially Wharton (University of Pennsylvania’s Business School). By contrast, Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth, and University of Pennsylvania (general studies) were frequently described as “second tier” schools that were filled primarily with candidates who “didn’t get in” to a super-elite school. Definitions of “top-tier” were even narrower for professional schools, primarily referring to Yale, Harvard, Stanford, and to a lesser extent Columbia law schools... line feed character in |quote= at position 747 (help) ^ ""Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education College Rankings 2021"".

Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save NEW HAVEN, CT (WFSB) - Yale University has reinstituted their mask mandate.Days after the CDC identified seven Connecticut counties, including New Haven County, as COVID hotspots, Yale University made the call to bring back a mask mandate, requiring masks indoors, as well as outdoors at large gatherings and while waiting for a university shuttle, no matter your vaccination status. One Connecticut university is officially bringing back a mask mandate. Some students say that it’s understandable, especially with the more contagious Delta variant spreading, but there are critics too, who were hopeful to be fully unmasked this Fall.“It’s a requirement to come back in the Fall, so I think people are wondering why. That seems like such a large measure there,"" rising sophomore Matthew Pollack tells us.Matthew says the new mandate is frustrating, because there already was a COVID vaccine requirement in place to be on-campus this Fall, but he gets there’s more to find out about how the Delta variant spreads among the vaccinated. “I understand that. At the same time, it’s a shame, because my entire time here has been with masks and with a lot of restrictions, so it’s a shame to not see that going away,"" continued Pollack.Rising junior Caroline White applauded Yale’s new mandate, calling it a step in the right direction.She hopes other colleges and universities take note. For her, it’s all about safety.“I think that Yale is kind of a paragon, often times, in the community and it makes a lot of sense for them to show the way, and show that masks are a requirement for this new era, given the rising tides in vaccine hesitancy,"" White added.While all students, staff, and faculty have to be fully vaccinated to be on campus in the fall, they also had to be fully vaccinated if they were studying or working on campus this Summer.

At that time, more than 163 million people in the United States were fully vaccinated against Covid-19.Divide those severe breakthrough cases by the total fully vaccinated population for the result: less than 0.004% of fully vaccinated people had a breakthrough case that led to hospitalization and less than 0.001% of fully vaccinated people died from a breakthrough Covid-19 case.Most of the breakthrough cases -- about 74% -- occurred among adults 65 or older.

As of the 2010 Census, it has the highest per-capita income, second-highest level of human development behind Massachusetts, and highest median household income in the United States.[10][11] It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and the Long Island Sound to the south. Its capital is Hartford and its most populous city is Bridgeport. Historically the state is part of New England as well as the tri-state area with New York and New Jersey, which together make up metropolitan New York City. The state is named for the Connecticut River which approximately bisects the state. The word ""Connecticut"" is derived from various anglicized spellings of “Quononoquett (Conanicut),” a Mohegan-Pequot word for ""long tidal river"".[12] Connecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called Fort Hoop in Hartford at the confluence of the Park and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially claimed by the Dutch colony New Netherland, which included much of the land between the Connecticut and Delaware Rivers, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. Thomas Hooker led a band of followers from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded the Connecticut Colony; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the Saybrook Colony and the New Haven Colony. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of Fundamental Orders, considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a crown colony. Connecticut was one of the Thirteen Colonies which rejected British rule in the American Revolution. Connecticut is the third smallest state by area,[13] the 29th most populous,[14] and the fourth most densely populated[13] of the fifty states. It is known as the ""Constitution State"", the ""Nutmeg State"", the ""Provisions State"", and the ""Land of Steady Habits"".[1] It was influential in the development of the federal government of the United States (see Connecticut Compromise). The Connecticut River, Thames River, and ports along Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong maritime tradition which continues today. The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in Fairfield County.

The state capital and fourth largest city is Hartford, and other major cities and towns (by population) include Bridgeport, New Haven, Stamford, Waterbury, Norwalk, Danbury, New Britain, Greenwich, and Bristol. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of Montenegro. There are 169 incorporated towns in Connecticut. The highest peak in Connecticut is Bear Mountain in Salisbury in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York meet (42°3′ N, 73°29′ W), on the southern slope of Mount Frissell, whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.[15] At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level. Connecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history—yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on Long Island Sound, which is an estuary. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the ""race"" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when tropical cyclones pass off the upper East Coast.[citation needed] The Connecticut River cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the Connecticut River Valley. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern Litchfield Hills, it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal marshes, beaches, and large scale maritime activities. Further information: List of Connecticut rivers Connecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a green. Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of New England towns, such as a white church, a colonial meeting house, a colonial tavern or inn, several colonial houses, and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both historic preservation and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England. The northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately 2.5 miles (4.0 km) square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern Southwick's residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.[16][17] The southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a panhandle in Fairfield County, containing the towns of Greenwich, Stamford, New Canaan, Darien, and parts of Norwalk and Wilton. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of territorial disputes in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from Ridgefield to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to Rye, New York.[18] Further information: Connecticut panhandle Areas maintained by the National Park Service include Appalachian National Scenic Trail, Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor, and Weir Farm National Historic Site.[19] vteRivers of Connecticut by drainage systemLong Island SoundBlack Rock Harbor Ash Creek Rooster River Bridgeport Harbor Pequonnock River Connecticut River Watershed Blackledge River

Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix of rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower East Coast. Connecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of sunshine annually.[20] Early spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building Bermuda High creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of 81 °F (27 °C) and 85 °F (29 °C) in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to 100 °F (38 °C) occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.[21] During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare. Weather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s °F for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing. Winters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from 38 °F (3 °C) in the coastal lowlands to 33 °F (1 °C) in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about 60 inches (1,500 mm) in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only 20–25 inches (510–640 mm) along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of Interstate 84 receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state. Connecticut's record high temperature is 106 °F (41 °C) which occurred in Danbury on July 15, 1995; the record low is −32 °F (−36 °C) which occurred in the Northwest Hills Falls Village on February 16, 1943, and Coventry on January 22, 1961.[22] Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (°F) City Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Bridgeport 38/24 40/25 47/32 58/41 68/51 77/61 83/67 81/67 75/59 64/48 53/38 43/30 Hartford 35/18 38/20 47/28 60/38 71/48 79/57 85/63 83/61 75/53 63/42 51/33 40/24 [23][24] Flora[edit] Main article: Flora of Connecticut See also: List of Connecticut tree species Forests consist of a mix of Northeastern coastal forests of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland New England-Acadian forests in the northwestern parts of the state. Mountain Laurel (Kalmia latifolia) is the state flower and is native to low ridges in several parts of Connecticut. Rosebay Rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum) is also native to eastern uplands of Connecticut and Pachaug State Forest is home to the Rhododendron Sanctuary Trail. Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides), is found in wetlands in the southern parts of the state. Connecticut has one native cactus (Opuntia humifusa), found in sandy coastal areas and low hillsides. Several types of beach grasses and wildflowers are also native to Connecticut.[25] Connecticut spans USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 5b to 7a. Coastal Connecticut is the broad transition zone where more southern and subtropical plants are cultivated. In some coastal communities, Magnolia grandiflora (southern magnolia), Crape Myrtles, scrub palms (Sabal minor), Needle Palms (Rhapidophyllum hystrix), and other broadleaved evergreens are cultivated in small numbers.[citation needed] History[edit] Main article: History of Connecticut A map of the Connecticut, New Haven, and Saybrook colonies First people[edit] The name Connecticut is derived from the Mohegan-Pequot word that has been translated as ""long tidal river"" and ""upon the long river"",[26] referring to the Connecticut River. Evidence of human presence in the Connecticut region dates to as much as 10,000 years ago. Stone tools were used for hunting, fishing, and woodworking. Semi-nomadic in lifestyle, these peoples moved seasonally to take advantage of various resources in the area. They shared languages based on Algonquian.[27] The Connecticut region was inhabited by multiple Native American tribes which can be grouped into the Nipmuc, the Sequin or ""River Indians"" (which included the Tunxis, Schaghticoke, Podunk, Wangunk, Hammonasset, and Quinnipiac), the Mattabesec or ""Wappinger Confederacy"" and the Pequot-Mohegan.[28] Some of these groups continue to abide in Connecticut, including the Mohegans, the Pequots, and the Paugusetts.[29] Colonial period[edit] Main articles: New Netherland, Saybrook Colony, Connecticut Colony, New Haven Colony, New England Confederation, and Dominion of New England The first European explorer in Connecticut was Dutchman Adriaen Block,[30] who explored the region in 1614. Dutch fur traders then sailed up the Connecticut River, which they called Versche Rivier (""Fresh River""), and built a fort at Dutch Point in Hartford that they named ""House of Hope"" (Dutch: Huis van Hoop).[31] The Connecticut Colony was originally a number of separate, smaller settlements at Windsor, Wethersfield, Saybrook, Hartford, and New Haven. The first English settlers came in 1633 and settled at Windsor, and then at Wethersfield the following year.[32] John Winthrop the Younger of Massachusetts received a commission to create Saybrook Colony at the mouth of the Connecticut River in 1635.[33] The main body of settlers came in one large group in 1636. They were Puritans from Massachusetts Bay Colony led by Thomas Hooker, who established the Connecticut Colony at Hartford.[34] The Quinnipiack Colony[35] was established by John Davenport, Theophilus Eaton, and others at New Haven in March 1638. The New Haven Colony had its own constitution called ""The Fundamental Agreement of the New Haven Colony"", signed on June 4, 1639.[36] The settlements were established without official sanction of the English Crown, and each was an independent political entity.[37] In 1662, Winthrop traveled to England and obtained a charter from Charles II which united the settlements of Connecticut.[38] Historically important colonial settlements included Windsor (1633), Wethersfield (1634), Saybrook (1635), Hartford (1636), New Haven (1638), Fairfield (1639), Guilford (1639), Milford (1639), Stratford (1639), Farmington (1640), Stamford (1641), and New London (1646). The Pequot War marked the first major clash between colonists and Native Americans in New England. The Pequots reacted with increasing aggression to Colonial settlements in their territory—while simultaneously taking lands from the Narragansett and Mohegan tribes. Settlers responded to a murder in 1636 with a raid on a Pequot village on Block Island; the Pequots laid siege to Saybrook Colony's garrison that autumn, then raided Wethersfield in the spring of 1637. Colonists declared war on the Pequots, organized a band of militia and allies from the Mohegan and Narragansett tribes, and attacked a Pequot village on the Mystic River, with death toll estimates ranging between 300 and 700 Pequots. After suffering another major loss at a battle in Fairfield, the Pequots asked for a truce and peace terms.[39] The western boundaries of Connecticut have been subject to change over time. The Hartford Treaty with the Dutch was signed on September 19, 1650, but it was never ratified by the British. According to it, the western boundary of Connecticut ran north from Greenwich Bay for a distance of 20 miles (32 km),[40][41] ""provided the said line come not within 10 miles of Hudson River"".[40][41] This agreement was observed by both sides until war erupted between England and The Netherlands in 1652. Conflict continued concerning colonial limits until the Duke of York captured New Netherland in 1664.[40][41] On the other hand, Connecticut's original Charter in 1662 granted it all the land to the ""South Sea""—that is, to the Pacific Ocean.[42] Most Colonial royal grants were for long east–west strips. Connecticut took its grant seriously and established a ninth county between the Susquehanna River and Delaware River named Westmoreland County. This resulted in the brief Pennamite Wars with Pennsylvania.[43] Yale College was established in 1701, providing Connecticut with an important institution to educate clergy and civil leaders.[44] The Congregational church dominated religious life in the colony and, by extension, town affairs in many parts.[45] With more than 600 miles of coastline including along its navigable rivers,[46] during the colonial years Connecticut developed the antecedents of a maritime tradition that would later produce booms in shipbuilding, marine transport, naval support, seafood production, and leisure boating. Historical records list the Tryall as the first vessel built in Connecticut Colony, in 1649 at a site on the Connecticut River in present-day Wethersfield.[47] In the two decades leading up to 1776 and the American Revolution, Connecticut boatyards launched about 100 sloops, schooners and brigs according to a database of U.S. customs records maintained online by the Mystic Seaport Museum, the largest being the 180-ton Patient Mary launched in New Haven in 1763.[48] Connecticut's first lighthouse was constructed in 1760 at the mouth of the Thames River with the New London Harbor Lighthouse.[49] American Revolution[edit] Main articles: American Revolutionary War, Lee Resolution, United States Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation § Ratification, Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga, Treaty of Paris (1783), Constitutional Convention (United States), Admission to the Union, and List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union A 1799 map of Connecticut which shows The Oblong, from Low's Encyclopaedia Connecticut designated four delegates to the Second Continental Congress who signed the Declaration of Independence: Samuel Huntington, Roger Sherman, William Williams, and Oliver Wolcott.[50] Connecticut's legislature authorized the outfitting of six new regiments in 1775, in the wake of the clashes between British regulars and Massachusetts militia at Lexington and Concord. There were some 1,200 Connecticut troops on hand at the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775.[51] In 1775, David Bushnell invented the Turtle which the following year launched the first submarine attack in history, unsuccessfully against a British warship at anchor in New York Harbor.[52] In 1777, the British got word of Continental Army supplies in Danbury, and they landed an expeditionary force of some 2,000 troops in Westport. This force then marched to Danbury and destroyed homes and much of the depot. Continental Army troops and militia led by General David Wooster and General Benedict Arnold engaged them on their return march at Ridgefield in 1777.[53] For the winter of 1778–79, General George Washington decided to split the Continental Army into three divisions encircling New York City, where British General Sir Henry Clinton had taken up winter quarters.[54] Major General Israel Putnam chose Redding as the winter encampment quarters for some 3,000 regulars and militia under his command. The Redding encampment allowed Putnam's soldiers to guard the replenished supply depot in Danbury and to support any operations along Long Island Sound and the Hudson River Valley.[55] Some of the men were veterans of the winter encampment at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, the previous winter. Soldiers at the Redding camp endured supply shortages, cold temperatures, and significant snow, with some historians dubbing the encampment ""Connecticut's Valley Forge"".[56] The state was also the launching site for a number of raids against Long Island orchestrated by Samuel Holden Parsons and Benjamin Tallmadge,[57] and provided men and material for the war effort, especially to Washington's army outside New York City. General William Tryon raided the Connecticut coast in July 1779, focusing on New Haven, Norwalk, and Fairfield.[58] New London and Groton Heights were raided in September 1781 by Benedict Arnold, who had turned traitor to the British.[59] At the outset of the American Revolution, the Continental Congress assigned Nathaniel Shaw Jr. of New London as its naval agent in charge of recruiting privateers to seize British vessels as opportunities presented, with nearly 50 operating out of the Thames River which eventually drew the reprisal from the British force led by Arnold.[60] 19th century[edit] Early national period and industrial revolution[edit] Connecticut ratified the U.S. Constitution on January 9, 1788, becoming the fifth state.[61] The state prospered during the era following the American Revolution, as mills and textile factories were built and seaports flourished from trade[62] and fisheries. After Congress established in 1790 the predecessor to the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service that would evolve into the U.S. Coast Guard, President Washington assigned Jonathan Maltbie as one of seven masters to enforce customs regulations, with Maltbie monitoring the southern New England coast with a 48-foot cutter sloop named Argus.[63] In 1786, Connecticut ceded territory to the U.S. government that became part of the Northwest Territory. The state retained land extending across the northern part of present-day Ohio called the Connecticut Western Reserve.[64] The Western Reserve section was settled largely by people from Connecticut, and they brought Connecticut place names to Ohio. Connecticut made agreements with Pennsylvania and New York which extinguished the land claims within those states' boundaries and created the Connecticut Panhandle. The state then ceded the Western Reserve in 1800 to the federal government,[64] which brought it to its present boundaries (other than minor adjustments with Massachusetts). For the first time in 1800, Connecticut shipwrights launched more than 100 vessels in a single year. Over the following decade to the doorstep of renewed hostilities with Britain that sparked the War of 1812, Connecticut boatyards constructed close to 1,000 vessels, the most productive stretch of any decade in the 19th century.[48] During the war, the British launched raids in Stonington and Essex and blockaded vessels in the Thames River. Derby native Isaac Hull became Connecticut's best-known naval figure to win renown during the conflict, as captain of the USS Constitution. The British blockade during the War of 1812 hurt exports and bolstered the influence of Federalists who opposed the war.[65] The cessation of imports from Britain stimulated the construction of factories to manufacture textiles and machinery. Connecticut came to be recognized as a major center for manufacturing, due in part to the inventions of Eli Whitney and other early innovators of the Industrial Revolution.[66] The war led to the development of fast clippers that helped extend the reach of New England merchants to the Pacific and Indian oceans. The first half of the 19th century saw as well a rapid rise in whaling, with New London emerging as one of the New England industry's three biggest home ports after Nantucket and New Bedford.[67] The state was known for its political conservatism, typified by its Federalist party and the Yale College of Timothy Dwight. The foremost intellectuals were Dwight and Noah Webster,[68] who compiled his great dictionary in New Haven. Religious tensions polarized the state, as the Congregational Church struggled to maintain traditional viewpoints, in alliance with the Federalists. The failure of the Hartford Convention in 1814 hurt the Federalist cause, with the Democratic-Republican Party gaining control in 1817.[69] Connecticut had been governed under the ""Fundamental Orders"" since 1639, but the state adopted a new constitution in 1818.[70] Civil War era[edit] Main article: Connecticut in the American Civil War View of New London in 1854 Connecticut manufacturers played a major role in supplying the Union forces with weapons and supplies during the Civil War. The state furnished 55,000 men, formed into thirty full regiments of infantry, including two in the U.S. Colored Troops, with several Connecticut men becoming generals. The Navy attracted 250 officers and 2,100 men, and Glastonbury native Gideon Welles was Secretary of the Navy. James H. Ward of Hartford was the first U.S. Naval Officer killed in the Civil War.[71] Connecticut casualties included 2,088 killed in combat, 2,801 dying from disease, and 689 dying in Confederate prison camps.[72][73][74] A surge of national unity in 1861 brought thousands flocking to the colors from every town and city. However, as the war became a crusade to end slavery, many Democrats (especially Irish Catholics) pulled back. The Democrats took a pro-slavery position and included many Copperheads willing to let the South secede. The intensely fought 1863 election for governor was narrowly won by the Republicans.[75][76] Second industrial revolution[edit] 1895 map from Rand McNally Connecticut's extensive industry, dense population, flat terrain, and wealth encouraged the construction of railroads starting in 1839. By 1840, 102 miles (164 km) of line were in operation, growing to 402 miles (647 km) in 1850 and 601 miles (967 km) in 1860.[77] The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, called the New Haven or ""The Consolidated"", became the dominant Connecticut railroad company after 1872. J. P. Morgan began financing the major New England railroads in the 1890s, dividing territory so that they would not compete. The New Haven purchased 50 smaller companies, including steamship lines, and built a network of light rails (electrified trolleys) that provided inter-urban transportation for all of southern New England. By 1912, the New Haven operated over 2,000 miles (3,200 km) of track with 120,000 employees.[78] As steam-powered passenger ships proliferated after the Civil War, Noank would produce the two largest built in Connecticut during the 19th century, with the 332-foot wooden steam paddle wheeler Rhode Island launched in 1882, and the 345-foot paddle wheeler Connecticut seven years later. Connecticut shipyards would launch more than 165 steam-powered vessels in the 19th century.[48] In 1875, the first telephone exchange in the world was established in New Haven.[79] 20th century[edit] World War I[edit] When World War I broke out in 1914, Connecticut became a major supplier of weaponry to the U.S. military; by 1918, 80% of the state's industries were producing goods for the war effort.[80] Remington Arms in Bridgeport produced half the small-arms cartridges used by the U.S. Army,[81] with other major suppliers including Winchester in New Haven and Colt in Hartford.[82] Connecticut was also an important U.S. Navy supplier, with Electric Boat receiving orders for 85 submarines,[83] Lake Torpedo Boat building more than 20 subs,[84] and the Groton Iron Works building freighters.[85] On June 21, 1916, the Navy made Groton the site for its East Coast submarine base and school. The state enthusiastically supported the American war effort in 1917 and 1918 with large purchases of war bonds, a further expansion of industry, and an emphasis on increasing food production on the farms. Thousands of state, local, and volunteer groups mobilized for the war effort and were coordinated by the Connecticut State Council of Defense.[86] Manufacturers wrestled with manpower shortages; Waterbury's American Brass and Manufacturing Company was running at half capacity, so the federal government agreed to furlough soldiers to work there.[87] Interwar period[edit] In 1919, J. Henry Roraback started the Connecticut Light & Power Co.[88] which became the state's dominant electric utility. In 1925, Frederick Rentschler spurred the creation of Pratt & Whitney in Hartford to develop engines for aircraft; the company became an important military supplier in World War II and one of the three major manufacturers of jet engines in the world.[89] On September 21, 1938, the most destructive storm in New England history struck eastern Connecticut, killing hundreds of people.[90] The eye of the ""Long Island Express"" passed just west of New Haven and devastated the Connecticut shoreline between Old Saybrook and Stonington from the full force of wind and waves, even though they had partial protection by Long Island. The hurricane caused extensive damage to infrastructure, homes, and businesses. In New London, a 500-foot (150 m) sailing ship was driven into a warehouse complex, causing a major fire. Heavy rainfall caused the Connecticut River to flood downtown Hartford and East Hartford. An estimated 50,000 trees fell onto roadways.[91] World War II[edit] The advent of lend-lease in support of Britain helped lift Connecticut from the Great Depression,[92] with the state a major production center for weaponry and supplies used in World War II. Connecticut manufactured 4.1% of total U.S. military armaments produced during the war, ranking ninth among the 48 states,[93] with major factories including Colt[94] for firearms, Pratt & Whitney for aircraft engines, Chance Vought for fighter planes, Hamilton Standard for propellers,[95] and Electric Boat for submarines and PT boats.[96] In Bridgeport, General Electric produced a significant new weapon to combat tanks: the bazooka.[97] On May 13, 1940, Igor Sikorsky made an untethered flight of the first practical helicopter.[98] The helicopter saw limited use in World War II, but future military production made Sikorsky Aircraft's Stratford plant Connecticut's largest single manufacturing site by the start of the 21st century.[99] Post-World War II economic expansion[edit] Connecticut lost some wartime factories following the end of hostilities, but the state shared in a general post-war expansion that included the construction of highways[100] and resulting in middle-class growth in suburban areas. Prescott Bush represented Connecticut in the U.S. Senate from 1952 to 1963; his son George H.W. Bush and grandson George W. Bush both became presidents of the United States.[101] In 1965, Connecticut ratified its current constitution, replacing the document that had served since 1818.[102] In 1968, commercial operation began for the Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant in East Haddam; in 1970, the Millstone Nuclear Power Station began operations in Waterford.[103] In 1974, Connecticut elected Democratic Governor Ella T. Grasso, who became the first woman in any state to be elected governor without being the wife or widow of a previous governor.[104] Late 20th century[edit] Connecticut's dependence on the defense industry posed an economic challenge at the end of the Cold War. The resulting budget crisis helped elect Lowell Weicker as governor on a third-party ticket in 1990. Weicker's remedy was a state income tax which proved effective in balancing the budget, but only for the short-term. He did not run for a second term, in part because of this politically unpopular move.[105] In 1992, initial construction was completed on Foxwoods Casino at the Mashantucket Pequots reservation in eastern Connecticut, which became the largest casino in the Western Hemisphere. Mohegan Sun followed four years later.[106] Early 21st century[edit] In 2000, presidential candidate Al Gore chose Senator Joe Lieberman as his running mate, marking the first time that a major party presidential ticket included someone of the Jewish faith.[107] Gore and Lieberman fell five votes short of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney in the Electoral College. In the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, 65 state residents were killed, mostly Fairfield County residents who were working in the World Trade Center.[108] In 2004, Republican Governor John G. Rowland resigned during a corruption investigation, later pleading guilty to federal charges.[109][110] Connecticut was hit by three major storms in just over 14 months in 2011 and 2012, with all three causing extensive property damage and electric outages. Hurricane Irene struck Connecticut August 28, and damage totaled $235 million.[111] Two months later, the ""Halloween nor'easter"" dropped extensive snow onto trees, resulting in snapped branches and trunks that damaged power lines; some areas were without electricity for 11 days.[112] Hurricane Sandy had tropical storm-force winds when it reached Connecticut October 29, 2012.[113] Sandy's winds drove storm surges into streets and cut power to 98% of homes and businesses, with more than $360 million in damage.[114] On December 14, 2012, Adam Lanza shot and killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, and then killed himself.[115] The massacre spurred renewed efforts by activists for tighter laws on gun ownership nationally.[116] In the summer and fall of 2016, Connecticut experienced a drought in many parts of the state, causing some water-use bans. As of November 15, 2016 (2016-11-15), 45% of the state was listed at Severe Drought by the U.S. Drought Monitor, including almost all of Hartford and Litchfield counties. All the rest of the state was in Moderate Drought or Severe Drought, including Middlesex, Fairfield, New London, New Haven, Windham, and Tolland counties. This affected the agricultural economy in the state.[117][118][119] The 21st century in Connecticut in photos 9/11 killed 65 people from Connecticut. Governor John G. Rowland resigned from office for corruption in 2004. Tropical Storm Irene, August 2011 The 2011 October nor'easter caused major snow damage in the state. Category 1 Hurricane Sandy made landfall in Connecticut in October 2012, causing heavy destruction. In the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Adam Lanza killed twenty children and six adults.

This includes a natural increase since the last census of 67,427 (222,222 births minus 154,795 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 41,718 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 75,991 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 34,273. Based on the 2005 estimates, Connecticut moved from 29th most populous state to 30th. 2018 estimates put Connecticut's population at 3,572,665.[122] 6.6% of its population was reported as being under 5 years old, 24.7% under 18 years old, and 13.8% were 65 years of age or older. Females made up approximately 51.6% of the population, with 48.4% male. In 1790, 97% of the population in Connecticut was classified as ""rural"". The first census in which less than half the population was classified as rural was 1890. In the 2000 census, only 12.3% was considered rural. Most of western and southern Connecticut (particularly the Gold Coast) is strongly associated with New York City; this area is the most affluent and populous region of the state and has high property costs and high incomes. The center of population of Connecticut is located in the town of Cheshire.[123] Connecticut's population density map Population[edit] As of the 2010 United States Census, Connecticut's race and ethnic percentages were: 77.6% White (71.2% Non-Hispanic White, 6.4% White Hispanic) 10.1% Black or African American 0.3% Native American and Alaska Native 3.8% Asian 0.0% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander 5.6% from some other race 2.6% two or more races Hispanics and Latinos of any race made up 13.4% of the population in the 2010 Census.[124] The state's most populous ethnic group is Non-Hispanic White, but this has declined from 98% in 1940 to 71% in 2010.[125] Connecticut's racial breakdown of population Racial composition 1990 [126] 2000 [127] 2010[124] White 87.0% 81.6% 77.6% Black 8.3% 9.1% 10.1% Asian 1.5% 2.4% 3.8% Native 0.2% 0.3% 0.3% Native Hawaiian andother Pacific Islander – – – Other race 2.9% 4.3% 5.6% Two or more races – 2.2% 2.6% As of 2004, 11.4% of the population (400,000) was foreign-born.

As of 2000, 81.69% of Connecticut residents age 5 and older spoke English at home and 8.42% spoke Spanish, followed by Italian at 1.59%, French at 1.31%, and Polish at 1.20%.[128] The largest European ancestry groups are:[129] 19.3% Italian 17.9% Irish 10.7% English 10.4% German 8.6% Polish 6.6% French 3.0% French Canadian 2.7% American 2.0% Scottish 1.4% Scotch Irish Main Street, Newtown Birth data[edit] As of 2011[update], 46.1% of Connecticut's population younger than age 1 were minorities.[130] Racial and ethnic groups in Connecticut, 2010 Note: Births in table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.

Religion[edit] The religious affiliations of the people of Connecticut as of 2014[update]:[138] Religion in Connecticut (2014)[138] Religion Percent Protestant 35% Catholic 33% None 28% Jewish 3% Mormon 1% Eastern Orthodox 1% Other Christian 1% Buddhist 1% Hindu 1% Muslim 1% Other 2% Do not know 1% A Pew survey of Connecticut residents' religious self-identification showed the following distribution of affiliations: Protestant 35%, Mormonism 1%, Jewish 3%, Roman Catholic 33%, Orthodox 1%, Non-religious 28%, Jehovah's Witness 1%, Hinduism 1%, Buddhism 1% and Islam 1%.[138][139] Jewish congregations had 108,280 (3.2%) members in 2000.[140] The Jewish population is concentrated in the towns near Long Island Sound between Greenwich and New Haven, in Greater New Haven and in Greater Hartford, especially the suburb of West Hartford. According to the Association of Religion Data Archives, the largest Christian denominations, by number of adherents, in 2010 were: the Catholic Church, with 1,252,936; the United Church of Christ, with 96,506; and non-denominational Evangelical Protestants, with 72,863.[140] Recent immigration has brought other non-Christian religions to the state, but the numbers of adherents of other religions are still low. Connecticut is also home to New England's largest Protestant Church: The First Cathedral in Bloomfield, Connecticut, located in Hartford County. Hartford is seat to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford, which is sovereign over the Diocese of Bridgeport and the Diocese of Norwich.

Hartford is the poorest municipality in Connecticut, with a per capita income of $13,428 in 2000.[146] Entering the Merritt Parkway from New York in Greenwich, Connecticut As of December 2019, Connecticut's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 3.8%, with U.S. unemployment at 3.5% that month. Dating back to 1982, Connecticut recorded its lowest unemployment in 2000 between August and October, at 2.2%. The highest unemployment rate during that period occurred in November and December 2010 at 9.3%,[147] but economists expect record new levels of layoffs as a result of business closures in the spring of 2020 as the result of the coronavirus pandemic.[148] Taxation[edit] Tax is collected by the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services[149] and by local municipalities.[150] As of 2012, Connecticut residents had the second highest rate in the nation of combined state and local taxes after New York, at 12.6% of income compared to the national average of 9.9% as reported by the Tax Foundation.[151] Before 1991, Connecticut had an investment-only income tax system. Income from employment was untaxed, but income from investments was taxed at 13%, the highest rate in the U.S., with no deductions allowed for costs of producing the investment income, such as interest on borrowing. In 1991, under Governor Lowell P. Weicker Jr., an independent, the system was changed to one in which the taxes on employment income and investment income were equalized at a maximum rate of 4%. The new tax policy drew investment firms to Connecticut; as of 2019[update], Fairfield County was home to the headquarters for 16 of the 200 largest hedge funds in the world.[152] As of 2019[update], the income tax rates on Connecticut individuals were divided into seven tax brackets of 3% (on income up to $10,000); 5% ($10,000-$50,000); 5.5% ($50,000-$100,000); 6% ($100,000-$200,000); 6.5% ($200,000-$250,000); 6.9% ($250,000-$500,000); and 6.99% above $500,000, with additional amounts owed depending on the bracket.[153] All wages of Connecticut residents are subject to the state's income tax, even if earned outside the state. However, in those cases, Connecticut income tax must be withheld only to the extent the Connecticut tax exceeds the amount withheld by the other jurisdiction.[154] Since New York has higher income tax rates than Connecticut,[155] this effectively means that Connecticut residents who work in New York have no Connecticut income tax withheld. Connecticut permits a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions, but since residents who work in other states are still subject to Connecticut income taxation, they may owe taxes if the jurisdictional credit does not fully offset the Connecticut tax amount.[154] Connecticut levies a 6.35% state sales tax on the retail sale, lease, or rental of most goods.[156] Some items and services in general are not subject to sales and use taxes unless specifically enumerated as taxable by statute. A provision excluding clothing under $50 from sales tax was repealed as of July 1, 2011[update].[156] There are no additional sales taxes imposed by local jurisdictions. In 2001, Connecticut instituted what became an annual sales tax ""holiday"" each August lasting one week, when retailers do not have to remit sales tax on certain items and quantities of clothing that has varied from year to year.[157] State law authorizes municipalities to tax property, including real estate, vehicles and other personal property, with state statute providing varying exemptions, credits and abatements. All assessments are at 70% of fair market value.[150] The maximum property tax credit is $200 per return[158] and any excess may not be refunded or carried forward.[159] According to the Tax Foundation, on a per capita basis in the 2017 fiscal year Connecticut residents paid the 3rd highest average property taxes in the nation after New Hampshire and New Jersey.[160] As of January 1, 2020[update], gasoline taxes and fees in Connecticut were 40.13 cents per gallon, 11th highest in the United States which had a nationwide average of 36.13 cents a gallon excluding federal taxes. Diesel taxes and fees as of January 2020 in Connecticut were 46.50 cents per gallon, ninth highest nationally with the U.S. average at 37.91 cents.[161] Real estate[edit] In 2019, sales of single-family homes in Connecticut totaled 33,146 units, a 2.1 percent decline from the 2018 transaction total. The median home sold in 2019 recorded a transaction amount of $260,000, up 0.4 percent from 2018.[162] Connecticut had the seventh highest rate of home foreclosure activity in the country in 2019 at 0.53 percent of the total housing stock.[163] Industries[edit] See also: List of Connecticut companies Hartford Skyline Finance, insurance and real estate was Connecticut's largest industry in 2018 as ranked by gross domestic product, generating $75.7 billion in GDP that year.[164] Major financial industry employers include The Hartford, Travelers, Cigna, the Aetna subsidiary of CVS Health, Mass Mutual, People's United Financial, Bank of America, Realogy,[165] Bridgewater Associates,[166] GE Capital,[167] William Raveis Real Estate,[168] and Berkshire Hathaway through reinsurance and residential real estate subsidiaries. The combined educational, health and social services sector was the largest single industry as ranked by employment, with a combined workforce of 342,600 people at the end of 2019,[169] ranking fourth the year before in GDP at $28.3 billion. The broad business and professional services sector had the second highest GDP total in Connecticut in 2018 at an estimated $33.7 billion.[164] Manufacturing was the third biggest industry in 2018 with GDP of $30.8 billion,[164] dominated by Raytheon Technologies formed in the March 2020 merger of Hartford-based United Technologies and Waltham, Mass.-based Raytheon Co. As of the merger, Raytheon Technologies employed about 19,000 people in Connecticut through subsidiaries Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace.[170] Lockheed Martin subsidiary Sikorsky Aircraft operates Connecticut's single largest manufacturing plant in Stratford,[168] where it makes helicopters. Other major manufacturers include the Electric Boat division of General Dynamics, which makes submarines in Groton,[171] Boehringer Ingelheim, a pharmaceuticals manufacturer with its U.S. headquarters in Ridgefield,[168] and ASML, which in Wilton makes precision lithography machines used to create circuitry on semiconductors and flat-screen displays.[172] Connecticut historically was a center of gun manufacturing, and four gun-manufacturing firms continued to operate in the state as of December 2012[update], employing 2,000 people: Colt, Stag, Ruger, and Mossberg.[173] Marlin, owned by Remington, closed in April 2011.[174] Other large components of the Connecticut economy in 2018 included wholesale trade ($18.1 billion in GDP); information services ($13.8 billion); retail ($13.7 billion); arts, entertainment and food services ($9.1 billion); and construction ($8.3 billion).[164] Tourists spent $9.3 billion in Connecticut in 2017 according to estimates as part of a series of studies commissioned by the state of Connecticut.[175] Foxwoods Resort Casino and Mohegan Sun are the two biggest tourist draws and number among the state's largest employers;[176] both are located on Native American reservations in the eastern part of Connecticut. Connecticut's agricultural production totaled $580 million in 2017, with just over half of that revenue the result of nursery stock production. Milk production totaled $81 million that year, with other major product categories including eggs, vegetables and fruit, tobacco and shellfish.[177] Energy[edit] See also: List of power stations in Connecticut Connecticut's economy uses less energy to produce each dollar of GDP than all other states except California, Massachusetts, and New York. It uses less energy on a per-capita basis than all but six other states. It has no fossil-fuel resources, but does have renewable resources. Average retail electricity prices are the highest among the 48 contiguous states. While the vast majority of state's overall energy consumption is fossil fuels, nuclear power delivered over 40% of state's electricity generation in 2019. Refuse-derived fuels and other biomass provided the largest share of renewable electricity at about a 3% share. Solar and wind generation has grown in recent years. More than three-quarters of solar generation came from distributed small-scale installations such as rooftop solar in 2019, and there is planning underway to significantly increase renewable generation with the state's offshore wind resource.[178] Transportation[edit] Main article: Transportation in Connecticut Roads[edit] For a more comprehensive list, see List of State Routes in Connecticut. The Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge, locally known as the Q Bridge, carries ten lanes over the Quinnipiac River in New Haven, along the Connecticut Turnpike. The Interstate highways in the state are Interstate 95 (I-95) traveling southwest to northeast along the coast, I-84 traveling southwest to northeast in the center of the state, I-91 traveling north to south in the center of the state, and I-395 traveling north to south near the eastern border of the state. The other major highways in Connecticut are the Merritt Parkway and Wilbur Cross Parkway, which together form Connecticut Route 15 (Route 15), traveling from the Hutchinson River Parkway in New York parallel to I-95 before turning north of New Haven and traveling parallel to I-91, finally becoming a surface road in Berlin. I-95 and Route 15 were originally toll roads; they relied on a system of toll plazas at which all traffic stopped and paid fixed tolls. A series of major crashes at these plazas eventually contributed to the decision to remove the tolls in 1988.[179] Other major arteries in the state include U.S. Route 7 (US 7) in the west traveling parallel to the New York state line, Route 8 farther east near the industrial city of Waterbury and traveling north–south along the Naugatuck River Valley nearly parallel with US 7, and Route 9 in the east. Between New Haven and New York City, I-95 is one of the most congested highways in the United States. Although I-95 has been widened in several spots, some areas are only three lanes and this strains traffic capacity, resulting in frequent and lengthy rush hour delays. Frequently, the congestion spills over to clog the parallel Merritt Parkway and even US 1. The state has encouraged traffic reduction schemes, including rail use and ride-sharing.[180] Connecticut also has a very active bicycling community, with one of the highest rates of bicycle ownership and use in the United States, particularly in New Haven. According to the U.S. Census 2006 American Community Survey, New Haven has the highest percentage of commuters who bicycle to work of any major metropolitan center on the East Coast.[181] Rail[edit] A Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line train leaving Stamford Station Rail is a popular travel mode between New Haven and New York City's Grand Central Terminal. Southwestern Connecticut is served by the Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line, operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and providing commuter service to New York City and New Haven, with branches servicing New Canaan, Danbury, and Waterbury. Connecticut lies along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor which features frequent Northeast Regional and Acela Express service from New Haven south to New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC, and Norfolk, VA. Coastal cities and towns between New Haven and New London are also served by the Shore Line East commuter line. Several new stations were completed along the Connecticut shoreline recently, and a commuter rail service called the Hartford Line between New Haven and Springfield on Amtrak's New Haven-Springfield Line began operating in June 2018.[182] A proposed commuter rail service, the Central Corridor Rail Line, will connect New London with Norwich, Willimantic, Storrs, and Stafford Springs, with service continuing into Massachusetts and Brattleboro. Amtrak also operates a shuttle service (CTRail) between New Haven and Springfield, Massachusetts, serving Wallingford, Meriden, Berlin, Hartford, Windsor Locks, and Springfield, MA and the Vermonter runs from Washington to St. Albans, Vermont via the same line. Bus[edit] Statewide bus service is supplied by Connecticut Transit, owned by the Connecticut Department of Transportation, with smaller municipal authorities providing local service. Bus networks are an important part of the transportation system in Connecticut, especially in urban areas like Hartford, Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport and New Haven. Connecticut Transit also operates CTfastrak, a bus rapid transit service between New Britain and Hartford. The bus route opened to the public on March 28, 2015.[183][184][185] Air[edit] Bradley International Airport, the state's largest Bradley International Airport,[186] is located in Windsor Locks, 15 miles (24 km) north of Hartford. Many residents of central and southern Connecticut also make heavy use of JFK International Airport and Newark International Airports, especially for international travel. Smaller regional air service is provided at Tweed New Haven Regional Airport. Larger civil airports include Danbury Municipal Airport and Waterbury-Oxford Airport in western Connecticut, Hartford–Brainard Airport in central Connecticut, and Groton-New London Airport in eastern Connecticut. Sikorsky Memorial Airport is located in Stratford and mostly services cargo, helicopter and private aviation. Ferry[edit] The Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry travels between Bridgeport, Connecticut and Port Jefferson, New York by crossing Long Island Sound. Ferry service also operates out of New London to Orient, New York; Fishers Island, New York; and Block Island, Rhode Island, which are popular tourist destinations. Small local services operate the Rocky Hill–Glastonbury Ferry and the Chester–Hadlyme Ferry which cross the Connecticut River.

Before then, New Haven and Hartford alternated as capitals.[61] Constitutional history[edit] Main article: History of the Connecticut Constitution Connecticut is known as the ""Constitution State"". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth helped to orchestrate what became known as the Connecticut Compromise, or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress. The nickname also might refer to the Fundamental Orders of 1638–39. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's constitutional history. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King Charles II of England through the Connecticut Charter of 1662. Separate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern U.S. Constitution was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications. Executive[edit] The governor heads the executive branch. As of 2020[update], Ned Lamont is the Governor[187] and Susan Bysiewicz is the Lieutenant Governor;[188] both are Democrats. From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, Ella Grasso was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.[104] There are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, Developmental Services, Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs. In addition to these departments, there are other independent bureaus, offices and commissions.[189] In addition to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, there are four other executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters: Secretary of the State, Treasurer, Comptroller, and Attorney General. All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.[61] Legislative[edit] The legislature is the General Assembly. The General Assembly is a bicameral body consisting of an upper body, the State Senate (36 senators); and a lower body, the House of Representatives (151 representatives).[61] Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, except when absent from the chamber, when the President pro tempore presides. The Speaker of the House presides over the House.[190] As of 2021[update], Matthew Ritter is the Speaker of the House of Connecticut. As of 2021[update], Connecticut's United States Senators are Richard Blumenthal (Democrat) and Chris Murphy (Democrat).[191] Connecticut has five representatives in the U.S. House, all of whom are Democrats.[192] Locally elected representatives also develop Local ordinances to govern cities and towns.[193] The town ordinances often include noise control and zoning guidelines.[194] However, the State of Connecticut also provides statewide ordinances for noise control as well.[195] Judicial[edit] The highest court of Connecticut's judicial branch is the Connecticut Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice of Connecticut. The Supreme Court is responsible for deciding on the constitutionality of the law or cases as they relate to the law. Its proceedings are similar to those of the United States Supreme Court, with no testimony given by witnesses, and the lawyers of the two sides each present oral arguments no longer than thirty minutes. Following a court proceeding, the court may take several months to arrive at a judgment. As of 2020[update] the Chief Justice is Richard A. Robinson. In 1818, the court became a separate entity, independent of the legislative and executive branches.[196] The Appellate Court is a lesser statewide court and the Superior Courts are lower courts that resemble county courts of other states. The State of Connecticut also offers access to Arrest warrant enforcement statistics through the Office of Policy and Management.[197] Local government[edit] See also: Administrative divisions of Connecticut and several lists: List of municipalities of Connecticut by population, List of towns in Connecticut, List of cities in Connecticut, Borough (Connecticut), List of counties in Connecticut Connecticut does not have county government, unlike all other states except Rhode Island. Connecticut county governments were mostly eliminated in 1960, with the exception of sheriffs elected in each county.[198] In 2000, the county sheriff was abolished and replaced with the state marshal system, which has districts that follow the old county territories. The judicial system is divided into judicial districts at the trial-court level which largely follow the old county lines.[199] The eight counties are still widely used for purely geographical and statistical purposes, such as weather reports and census reporting. Connecticut shares with the rest of New England a governmental institution called the New England town. The state is divided into 169 towns which serve as the fundamental political jurisdictions.[61] There are also 21 cities,[61] most of which simply follow the boundaries of their namesake towns and have a merged city-town government. There are two exceptions: the City of Groton, which is a subsection of the Town of Groton, and the City of Winsted in the Town of Winchester. There are also nine incorporated boroughs which may provide additional services to a section of town.[61][200] Naugatuck is a consolidated town and borough. The state is also divided into nine regional councils of government defined by the state Office of Planning and Management, which facilitate regional planning and coordination of services between member towns.[201] The Intragovernmental Policy Division of this Office coordinates regional planning with the administrative bodies of these regions. Each region has an administrative body made up chief executive officers of the member towns. The regions are established for the purpose of planning ""coordination of regional and state planning activities; redesignation of logical planning regions and promotion of the continuation of regional planning organizations within the state; and provision for technical aid and the administration of financial assistance to regional planning organizations"".[201] Politics[edit] Further information: Political party strength in Connecticut and Elections in Connecticut Connecticut political party registration 1958–2012, marked with presidential influence Registered voters[edit] Connecticut residents who register to vote may declare an affiliation to a political party, may become unaffiliated at will, and may change affiliations subject to certain waiting periods. As of 2021[update] around 59% of registered voters are enrolled (1.7% total in 28 third parties minor parties), and ratios among unaffiliated voters and the two major parties are about eight unaffiliated for every seven in the Democratic Party of Connecticut and for every four in the Connecticut Republican Party. (Among the minor parties, the Libertarian Party and Green Party appeared in the Presidential-electors column in 2016, and drew, respectively, 2.96% and 1.39% of the vote.) Many Connecticut towns and cities show a marked preference for moderate candidates of either party.[2] Party registration as of October 27, 2020[202] Party Total voters Percentage Unaffiliated 1,025,878 40.95% Democratic 926,567 36.99% Republican 510,012 20.36% Minor parties 42,619 1.70% Total 2,505,076 100% Voting[edit] In July 2009, the Connecticut legislature overrode a veto by Governor M. Jodi Rell to pass SustiNet, the first significant public-option health care reform legislation in the nation.[203] In April 2012, both houses of the Connecticut state legislature passed a bill (20 to 16 and 86 to 62) that abolished the capital punishment for all future crimes, while 11 inmates who were waiting on the death row at the time could still be executed.[204] Education[edit] Further information: List of school districts in Connecticut Connecticut ranked third in the nation for educational performance, according to Education Week's Quality Counts 2018 report. It earned an overall score of 83.5 out of 100 points. On average, the country received a score of 75.2.[205] Connecticut posted a B-plus in the Chance-for-Success category, ranking fourth on factors that contribute to a person's success both within and outside the K-12 education system. Connecticut received a mark of B-plus and finished fourth for School Finance. It ranked 12th with a grade of C on the K-12 Achievement Index.[205] K–12[edit] See also: Connecticut State Board of Education Public schools[edit] See also: Category:Public schools in Connecticut The Connecticut State Board of Education manages the public school system for children in grades K–12. Board of Education members are appointed by the Governor of Connecticut. Statistics for each school are made available to the public through an online database system called ""CEDAR"".[206] The CEDAR database also provides statistics for ""ACES"" or ""RESC"" schools for children with behavioral disorders.[207] Private schools[edit] See also: Country Day School movement Academy of Our Lady of Mercy, Lauralton Hall (1905) Avon Old Farms School (1927) Bridgeport International Academy (1997) Brunswick School (1902) Canterbury School (1915) Cheshire Academy (1794) Choate Rosemary Hall (1890) East Catholic High School (1961) Ethel Walker School (1911) Fairfield Country Day School (1936) Fairfield College Preparatory School (1942) Foote School (1916) Greens Farms Academy (1925) Greenwich Country Day School (1926) The Gunnery (1850) Hopkins School (1660) Hotchkiss School (1891) Kent School (1906) Kingswood-Oxford School (1909) Loomis Chaffee (1914) Marianapolis Preparatory School (1926) The Master's School (1970) Mercy High School (1963) Miss Porter's School (1843) New Canaan Country School (1916) Northwest Catholic High School (1961) Norwich Free Academy (1854) Notre Dame Catholic High School (1955) Notre Dame High School (1946) Pomfret School (1894) Rumsey Hall School (1900) Sacred Heart Academy (1946) Saint Bernard School (1956) Stanwich School (1998) St. Paul Catholic High School (1966) Suffield Academy (1833) The Taft School (1890) Watkinson School (1881) Westminster School (Connecticut) Westover School (1909) The Williams School (1891) Xavier High School (1963) Colleges and universities[edit] Connecticut was home to the nation's first law school, Litchfield Law School, which operated from 1773 to 1833 in Litchfield.

Sports[edit] There are two Connecticut teams in the American Hockey League. The Bridgeport Islanders is a farm team for the New York Islanders which competes at the Webster Bank Arena in Bridgeport. The Hartford Wolf Pack is the affiliate of the New York Rangers; they play in the XL Center in Hartford. The Hartford Yard Goats of the Eastern League are a AA affiliate of the Colorado Rockies. Also, the Norwich Sea Unicorns play in the New England college baseball league . The New Britain Bees play in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. The Connecticut Sun of the WNBA currently play at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville. In soccer, Hartford Athletic began play in the USL Championship in 2019, serving as the reserve team for the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer. The state hosts several major sporting events. Since 1952, a PGA Tour golf tournament has been played in the Hartford area. It was originally called the ""Insurance City Open"" and later the ""Greater Hartford Open"" and is now known as the Travelers Championship. Lime Rock, a home of the American Le Mans Series Lime Rock Park in Salisbury is a 1.5-mile (2.4 km) road racing course, home to the International Motor Sports Association, SCCA, United States Auto Club, and K&N Pro Series East races. Thompson International Speedway, Stafford Motor Speedway, and Waterford Speedbowl are oval tracks holding weekly races for NASCAR Modifieds and other classes, including the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour. The state also hosts several major mixed martial arts events for Bellator MMA and the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Professional sports teams[edit] The Hartford Whalers of the National Hockey League played in Hartford from 1975 to 1997 at the Hartford Civic Center. They departed to Raleigh, North Carolina, after disputes with the state over the construction of a new arena, and they are now known as the Carolina Hurricanes. In 1926, Hartford had a franchise in the National Football League known as the Hartford Blues.[222] They joined the National League for one season in 1876, making them the state's only Major League baseball franchise before moving to Brooklyn, New York, and then disbanding one season later. From 2000 until 2006 the city was home to the Hartford FoxForce of World TeamTennis.[223] Team Sport League Bridgeport Islanders Ice hockey American Hockey League Hartford Wolf Pack Ice hockey American Hockey League Connecticut Whale Ice hockey National Women's Hockey League Hartford Yard Goats Baseball Eastern League (AA) Norwich Sea Unicorns Baseball New York–Penn League (A) New Britain Bees Baseball Futures Collegiate Baseball League Connecticut Sun Basketball Women's National Basketball Association Hartford City FC Soccer National Premier Soccer League Hartford Athletic Soccer USL Championship AC Connecticut Soccer USL League Two College sports[edit] Yale Bowl during ""The Game"" between Yale and Harvard. The Bowl was also the home of the NFL's New York Giants in 1973–74. The Connecticut Huskies are the team of the University of Connecticut (UConn); they play NCAA Division I sports. Both the men's basketball and women's basketball teams have won multiple national championships. In 2004, UConn became the first school in NCAA Division I history to have its men's and women's basketball programs win the national title in the same year; they repeated the feat in 2014 and are still the only Division I school to win both titles in the same year.[224][225] The UConn women's basketball team holds the record for the longest consecutive winning streak in NCAA college basketball at 111 games, a streak that ended in 2017.[226] The UConn Huskies football team has played in the Football Bowl Subdivision since 2002, and has played in four bowl games. New Haven biennially hosts ""The Game"" between the Yale Bulldogs and the Harvard Crimson, the country's second-oldest college football rivalry. Yale alumnus Walter Camp is deemed the ""Father of American Football"", and he helped develop modern football while living in New Haven.[227] Other Connecticut universities which feature Division I sports teams are Quinnipiac University, Fairfield University, Central Connecticut State University, Sacred Heart University, and the University of Hartford. The Constitution State Rivalry is an in-state college football rivalry between Sacred Heart University and Central Connecticut State University. Both teams compete at the NCAA Division 1 Football Championship Subdivision level in the Northeast Conference.[228] Since 1998, the game has been played annually with the location of the matchup determined on a yearly basis.

It may have come from its sailors returning from voyages with nutmeg, which was a very valuable spice in the 18th and 19th centuries. It may have originated in the early machined sheet tin nutmeg grinders sold by early Connecticut peddlers. It is also facetiously said to come from Yankee peddlers from Connecticut who would sell small carved nobs of wood shaped to look like nutmeg to unsuspecting customers.[229] George Washington gave Connecticut the title of ""The Provisions State""[1] because of the material aid that the state rendered to the American Revolutionary War effort. Connecticut is also known as ""The Land of Steady Habits"".[1] According to Webster's New International Dictionary (1993), a person who is a native or resident of Connecticut is a ""Connecticuter"". There are numerous other terms coined in print but not in use, such as ""Connecticotian"" (Cotton Mather in 1702) and ""Connecticutensian"" (Samuel Peters in 1781). Linguist Allen Walker Read suggests the more playful term ""connecticutie"". ""Nutmegger"" is sometimes used,[229] as is ""Yankee"". The official state song is ""Yankee Doodle"". The traditional abbreviation of the state's name is ""Conn"".; the official postal abbreviation is CT. Commemorative stamps issued by the United States Postal Service with Connecticut themes include Nathan Hale, Eugene O'Neill, Josiah Willard Gibbs, Noah Webster, Eli Whitney, the whaling ship the Charles W. Morgan, which is docked at Mystic Seaport, and a decoy of a broadbill duck.

Founded in 1701 as the Collegiate School, it is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine Colonial Colleges chartered before the American Revolution. The Collegiate School was renamed Yale College in 1718 to honor the school's largest private benefactor for the first century of its existence, Elihu Yale.[7][8] Yale University is referred to as a member of the Big Three (colleges), is consistently ranked as one of the top universities and is considered one of the most prestigious in the nation and in the world.[9][10][11][12] Chartered by Connecticut Colony, the Collegiate School was established in 1701 by clergy to educate Congregational ministers before moving to New Haven in 1716. Originally restricted to theology and sacred languages, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution. In the 19th century, the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first PhD in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887. Yale's faculty and student populations grew after 1890 with rapid expansion of the physical campus and scientific research. Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools. While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the university owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, a campus in West Haven, Connecticut, and forests and nature preserves throughout New England. As of June 2020, the university's endowment was valued at $31.1 billion, the second largest of any educational institution.[1] The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.[13][14] Students compete in intercollegiate sports as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I – Ivy League. As of October 2020, 65 Nobel laureates, five Fields Medalists, four Abel Prize laureates, and three Turing award winners have been affiliated with Yale University. In addition, Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five U.S. Presidents, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, 31 living billionaires,[15] and many heads of state. Hundreds of members of Congress and many U.S. diplomats, 78 MacArthur Fellows, 252 Rhodes Scholars, 123 Marshall Scholars, and nine Mitchell Scholars have been affiliated with the university.

(July 2021) Early history of Yale College[edit] Origins[edit] Charter creating the Collegiate School, which became Yale College, October 9, 1701 Yale traces its beginnings to ""An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School"", a would-be charter passed during a meeting in New Haven by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut on October 9, 1701. The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. Soon after, a group of ten Congregational ministers, Samuel Andrew, Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather (nephew of Increase Mather), Rev. James Noyes II (son of James Noyes), James Pierpont, Abraham Pierson, Noadiah Russell, Joseph Webb, and Timothy Woodbridge, all alumni of Harvard, met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell, located in Branford, Connecticut, to donate their books to form the school's library.[16] The group, led by James Pierpont, is now known as ""The Founders"".[17] A Front View of Yale-College and the College Chapel, printed by Daniel Bowen in 1786 From its origin it is known as the ""Collegiate School"", the institution opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson, who is today considered the first president of Yale. Pierson lived in Killingworth (now Clinton). The school moved to Saybrook and then Wethersfield. In 1716, it moved to New Haven, Connecticut. Meanwhile, there was a rift forming at Harvard between its sixth president, Increase Mather, and the rest of the Harvard clergy, whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in Church polity. The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not.[18] Rev. Jason Haven, the minister at the First Church and Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts had been considered for the presidency on account of his orthodox theology and for ""Neatness dignity and purity of Style [which] surpass those of all that have been mentioned,"" but was passed over due to his ""very Valetudinary and infirm State of Health.""[19] Naming and development[edit] Coat of arms of the family of Elihu Yale, after whom the university was named in 1718 In 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted the successful Boston born businessman Elihu Yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Elihu ""Eli"" Yale, who had made a fortune in Madras while working for the East India Company as the first president of Fort St. George (largely through secret contracts with Madras merchants that were illegal under Company policy[20]), donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than £560, a substantial sum of money at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to ""Yale College.""[21] The Welsh name Yale is the Anglicized spelling of the Iâl, which the family estate at Plas yn Iâl, near the village of Llandegla, was called. Meanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology at the time.[22] It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the ""new divinity."" In 1722 the Rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745 and while he attempted to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy, he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.[23] Founders' connections to the slave trade[edit] One of Elihu Yale's responsibilities as president of Fort St. George was overseeing its slave trade, though he himself was never a slave trader, never owned slaves, opposed the slave trade, and imposed several restrictions on it during his tenure.[24] Critics nonetheless argue that he benefited from the trade by having it as one of his responsibilities as president, despite not owning any of the traded human beings or profiting from their sales.[25] The controversy over Yale University being named to honor the slave trader Elihu Yale dates back to at least 1994. In 2007, Yale University removed a painting which shows Elihu Yale attended to by a child slave. At the time, Yale University stated that the issues with Elihu Yale had begun at least 13 years prior. Although Elihu Yale was the president of the East India Company, a Yale University spokesperson claimed that, ""...Elihu Yale did not support slavery...""[26] A 2017 Wall Street Journal opinion article also called for renaming Yale University.[27][28] Since 2016, Yale University has acknowledged that Elihu Yale was ""...involved [in] and profited from the slave trade.""[29] The controversy over Yale's name started anew in 2020 with a Yale Daily News post, ""Yale Has to Go!""[30] After years of protest, Yale University renamed Calhoun College as Hopper College in 2017. Calhoun College was named for a South Carolina slave owner and anti-abolitionist, Vice President John C. Calhoun.[31][32][33] Yale University also acquired a slave plantation to finance its graduate program.[34] Yale University has multiple other buildings named to honor slave owners, including Bishop George Berkeley, Timothy Dwight and Ezra Stiles.[35] Curriculum[edit] Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753 First diploma awarded by Yale College, granted to Nathaniel Chauncey in 1702 Yale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and is organized into a social system of residential colleges. Yale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period—the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment—due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents Thomas Clap and Ezra Stiles. They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, ""irrelevance"" of curricula, desperate need for endowment and disagreements with the Connecticut legislature.[36][37][page needed] Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for the study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the college from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. A 1746 graduate of Yale, Stiles came to the college with experience in education, having played an integral role in the founding of Brown University, in addition to having been a minister.[38] Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the college. However, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning, Secretary to the British General in command of the occupation, intervened and the college was saved. In 1803, Fanning was granted an honorary degree LL.D. for his efforts.[39] Students[edit] As the only college in Connecticut from 1701 to 1823, Yale educated the sons of the elite.[40] Punishable offenses for students included cardplaying, tavern-going, destruction of college property, and acts of disobedience to college authorities. During this period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side.[41] The emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such organizations were debating societies: Crotonia in 1738, Linonia in 1753 and Brothers in Unity in 1768. While the societies no longer exist, commemorations to them can be found with names given to campus structures, like Brothers in Unity Courtyard in Branford College. 19th century[edit] Old Brick Row in 1807 The Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. During this period, all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track curriculum. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because it was difficult for an institution to be completely modern or completely classical.[42][43] A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a person possessed of religious values strong enough to sufficiently resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without.[44][page needed] William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms of students. Sumner bested President Noah Porter, who disliked the social sciences and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. Porter objected to Sumner's use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students.[45] Until 1887, the legal name of the university was ""The President and Fellows of Yale College, in New Haven."" In 1887, under an act passed by the Connecticut General Assembly, Yale was renamed to the present ""Yale University.""[46] Sports and debate[edit] The Revolutionary War soldier Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the archetype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who ""regretted"" that he ""had but one life to lose"" for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in the combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied this same heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel Stover at Yale (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, the alumni, and the team itself.[47] Yale's four-oared crew team posing with the 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy, won in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Along with Harvard and Princeton, Yale students rejected British concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football.[48][page needed] The Harvard–Yale football rivalry began in 1875. Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates,[49][page needed] and in 1909 (the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale and Princeton) the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There were also rallies to send off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.[50] In 1909–10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905–06, which sought to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. Presidents Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate reforms to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. While the big three had attempted to operate independently of the majority, the changes pushed did reduce injuries.[51] Expansion[edit] Starting with the addition of the Yale School of Medicine in 1810, the college expanded gradually from then on, establishing the Yale Divinity School in 1822, Yale Law School in 1822, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1847, the now-defunct Sheffield Scientific School in 1847,[52] and the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1869. In 1887, under the presidency of Timothy Dwight V, Yale College was renamed to Yale University, and the former name was subsequently applied only to the undergraduate college. The university would continue to expand greatly into the 20th and 21st century, adding the Yale School of Music in 1894, the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies in 1900, the Yale School of Public Health in 1915, the Yale School of Architecture in 1916, the Yale School of Nursing 1923, the Yale School of Drama in 1955, the Yale School of Management in 1976, and the Jackson School of Global Affairs which is planned to open in 2022.[53] The Sheffield Scientific School would also reorganize its relationship with the university to teach only undergraduate courses. Expansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. Noah Porter, a moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership.[citation needed] Historian George Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.[54][page needed] Levesque continues, saying he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. Levesque concludes, mention how he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university. 20th century[edit] Medicine[edit] Woolsey Hall c. 1905 Milton Winternitz led the Yale School of Medicine as its dean from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about ""social medicine"" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the ""Yale System"" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the Psychiatry Department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to resign.[55] Faculty[edit] Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor of the Yale campus facing northBefore World War II, most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions.[56] Almost all members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—and some members of other faculties—teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually.[57] Women[edit] In 1793, Lucinda Foote passed the entrance exams for Yale College, but was rejected by the President on the basis of her gender.[58] Women studied at Yale University as early as 1892, in graduate-level programs at the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[59] In 1966, Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female and part of the Seven Sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the Ivy League when most Ivy League institutions still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969.[60] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate;[61] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall. The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year;[62] at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall at the south end of Old Campus.[63] A decade into co-education, student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit Alexander v. Yale. In the late 1970s, a group of students and one faculty member sued Yale for its failure to curtail campus sexual harassment by especially male faculty. The case was party built from a 1977 report authored by plaintiff Ann Olivarius, now a feminist attorney known for fighting sexual harassment, ""A report to the Yale Corporation from the Yale Undergraduate Women's Caucus.""[64] This case was the first to use Title IX to argue and establish that the sexual harassment of female students can be considered illegal sex discrimination. The plaintiffs in the case were Olivarius, Ronni Alexander (now a professor at Kobe University, Japan), Margery Reifler (works in the Los Angeles film industry), Pamela Price (civil rights attorney in California), and Lisa E. Stone (works at Anti-Defamation League). They were joined by Yale classics professor John “Jack” J. Winkler, who died in 1990. The lawsuit, brought partly by Catharine MacKinnon, alleged rape, fondling, and offers of higher grades for sex by several Yale faculty, including Keith Brion, professor of flute and Director of Bands, Political Science professor Raymond Duvall (now at the University of Minnesota), English professor Michael Cooke, and coach of the field hockey team, Richard Kentwell. While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale's Grievance Board and the Yale Women's Center.[65] In March 2011 a Title IX complaint was filed against Yale by students and recent graduates, including editors of Yale's feminist magazine Broad Recognition, alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate.[66] In response, the university formed a Title IX steering committee to address complaints of sexual misconduct.[67] Afterwards, universities and colleges throughout the US also established sexual harassment grievance procedures. Class[edit] Yale, like other Ivy League schools, instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to maintain the proportion of white Protestants from notable families in the student body (see numerus clausus), and was one of the last of the Ivies to eliminate such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970.[68] 21st century[edit] In 2006, Yale and Peking University (PKU) established a Joint Undergraduate Program in Beijing, an exchange program allowing Yale students to spend a semester living and studying with PKU honor students.[69] In July 2012, the Yale University-PKU Program ended due to weak participation.[69] In 2007 outgoing Yale President Rick Levin characterized Yale's institutional priorities: ""First, among the nation's finest research universities, Yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education. Second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in Yale College, we are committed to the education of leaders.""[70] In 2009, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair picked Yale as one location – the others being Britain's Durham University and Universiti Teknologi Mara – for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation's United States Faith and Globalization Initiative.[71] As of 2009, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is the director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar, ""Debating Globalization"".[72] As of 2009, former presidential candidate and DNC chair Howard Dean teaches a residential college seminar, ""Understanding Politics and Politicians"".[73] Also in 2009, an alliance was formed among Yale, University College London, and both schools' affiliated hospital complexes to conduct research focused on the direct improvement of patient care—a growing field known as translational medicine. President Richard Levin noted that Yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world, but ""no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with UCL"".[74] In August 2013, a new partnership with the National University of Singapore led to the opening of Yale-NUS College in Singapore, a joint effort to create a new liberal arts college in Asia featuring a curriculum including both Western and Asian traditions.[75] In 2020, in the wake of protests around the world focused on racial relations and criminal justice reform, the #CancelYale tag was used on social media to demand that Elihu Yale's name be removed from Yale University. Most support for the change stemmed from politically conservative pundits, such as Mike Cernovich and Ann Coulter, satirizing perceived excesses of online cancel culture.[76] Yale was president of the East India Company, a trading company that traded slaves as well as goods, [77] and his singularly large donation[78][79] led to Yale relying on money from the slave-trade for its first scholarships and endowments.[25][80] In August 2020, the US Justice Department claimed that Yale discriminated against Asian and white candidates on the basis of their race. The university, however, denied the report.[81] In early February 2021, under the new Biden administration, the Justice Department withdrew the lawsuit. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, known for a similar lawsuit against Harvard alleging the same issue, plans to refile the lawsuit.[82] Yale alumni in politics[edit] The Boston Globe wrote that ""if there's one school that can lay claim to educating the nation's top national leaders over the past three decades, it's Yale"".[83][verification needed] Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. presidential election between 1972 and 2004.[84] Yale-educated Presidents since the end of the Vietnam War include Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, and major-party nominees during this period include Hillary Clinton (2016), John Kerry (2004), Joseph Lieberman (Vice President, 2000), and Sargent Shriver (Vice President, 1972). Other Yale alumni who have made serious bids for the Presidency during this period include Amy Klobuchar (2020), Tom Steyer (2020), Ben Carson (2016), Howard Dean (2004), Gary Hart (1984 and 1988), Paul Tsongas (1992), Pat Robertson (1988) and Jerry Brown (1976, 1980, 1992). Several explanations have been offered for Yale's representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates.[85][verification needed] Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale's focus on creating ""a laboratory for future leaders,"" an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster.[85] Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: ""We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale.""[83] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes ""an ethos of organized activity"" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News.[86] Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: ""It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school.""[87] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the ""son and grandson of alumni"", and for a ""member of a politically influential family"".[88] New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and The Atlantic Monthly correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others.[89] During the 1988 presidential election, George H. W. Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis for having ""foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique"". When challenged on the distinction between Dukakis' Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was ""so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it"" and said Yale did not share Harvard's reputation for ""liberalism and elitism"".[90] In 2004 Howard Dean stated, ""In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of '68 and the class of '71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation"".[89] Administration and organization[edit] Leadership[edit] School founding School Year founded Yale College 1701 Yale School of Medicine 1810 Yale Divinity School 1822 Yale Law School 1843 Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences 1847 Sheffield Scientific School[52] 1847 Yale School of Fine Arts 1869 Yale School of Music 1894 Yale School of the Environment 1900 Yale School of Public Health 1915 Yale School of Architecture 1916 Yale School of Nursing 1923 David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University 1955 Yale School of Management 1976 Jackson School of Global Affairs Planned for fall 2022[53] The President and Fellows of Yale College, also known as the Yale Corporation, or board of trustees, is the governing body of the university and consists of thirteen standing committees with separate responsibilities outlined in the by-laws. The corporation has 19 members: three ex officio members, ten successor trustees, and six elected alumni fellows.[91] The university has three major academic components: Yale College (the undergraduate program), the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the twelve professional schools.[92] Yale's former president Richard C. Levin was, at the time, one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million.[93] Yale's succeeding president Peter Salovey ranks 40th with a 2020 salary of $1.16 million.[94] The Yale Provost's Office and similar executive positions have launched several women into prominent university executive positions. In 1977, Provost Hanna Holborn Gray was appointed interim President of Yale and later went on to become President of the University of Chicago, being the first woman to hold either position at each respective school.[95][96] In 1994, Provost Judith Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution at the University of Pennsylvania.[97] In 2002, Provost Alison Richard became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge.[98] In 2003, the Dean of the Divinity School, Rebecca Chopp, was appointed president of Colgate University and later went on to serve as the President of the Swarthmore College in 2009, and then the first female chancellor of the University of Denver in 2014.[99] In 2004, Provost Dr. Susan Hockfield became the President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[100] In 2004, Dean of the Nursing school, Catherine Gilliss, was appointed the Dean of Duke University's School of Nursing and Vice Chancellor for Nursing Affairs.[101] In 2007, Deputy Provost H. Kim Bottomly was named President of Wellesley College.[102] Similar examples for men who've served in Yale leadership positions can also be found. In 2004, Dean of Yale College Richard H. Brodhead was appointed as the President of Duke University.[103] In 2008, Provost Andrew Hamilton was confirmed to be the Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford.[104] Staff and labor unions[edit] See also: Federation of Hospital and University Employees Yale University staff are represented by several different unions. Clerical and technical workers are represented by Local 34, and service and maintenance workers are represented by Local 35, both of the same union affiliate UNITE HERE.[105] Unlike similar institutions, Yale has consistently refused to recognize its graduate student union, Local 33 (another affiliate of UNITE HERE), citing claims that the union's elections were undemocratic and how graduate students are not employees;[106][107] the move to not recognize the union has been criticized by the American Federation of Teachers.[108] In addition, officers of the Yale University Police Department are represented by the Yale Police Benevolent Association, which affiliated in 2005 with the Connecticut Organization for Public Safety Employees.[105][109] Yale security officers joined the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America in late 2010,[110] even though the Yale administration contested the election.[111] In October 2014, after deliberation,[112] Yale security decided to form a new union, the Yale University Security Officers Association, which has since represented the campus security officers.[105][113] Yale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations, often culminating in strikes.[114][page needed] There have been at least eight strikes since 1968, and The New York Times wrote that Yale has a reputation as having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the U.S.[115] Moreover, Yale has been accused by the AFL–CIO of failing to treat workers with respect,[116] as well as not renewing contracts with professors over involvement in campus labor issues.[117] Yale has responded to strikes with claims over mediocre union participation and the benefits of their contracts.[118] Campus[edit] Yale Law School, located in the Sterling Law Building Interior of Beinecke Library Yale's central campus in downtown New Haven covers 260 acres (1.1 km2) and comprises its main, historic campus and a medical campus adjacent to the Yale–New Haven Hospital. In western New Haven, the university holds 500 acres (2.0 km2) of athletic facilities, including the Yale Golf Course.[119] In 2008, Yale purchased the 17-building, 136-acre (0.55 km2) former Bayer HealthCare complex in West Haven, Connecticut,[120] the buildings of which are now used as laboratory and research space.[121] Yale also owns seven forests in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire—the largest of which is the 7,840-acre (31.7 km2) Yale-Myers Forest in Connecticut's Quiet Corner—and nature preserves including Horse Island.[122] Yale is noted for its largely Collegiate Gothic campus[123] as well as several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: Louis Kahn's Yale Art Gallery[124] and Center for British Art, Eero Saarinen's Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph's Art & Architecture Building. Yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along Hillhouse Avenue, which was considered the most beautiful street in America by Charles Dickens when he visited the United States in the 1840s.[125] In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the Yale campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States.[126] Many of Yale's buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness, including the Yale Drama School.[127][128] Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities, such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes, like a policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid,[129] deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, 216 feet (66 m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon Statue of Nathan Hale in front of Connecticut Hall Vanderbilt Hall Other examples of the Gothic style are on the Old Campus by architects like Henry Austin, Charles C. Haight and Russell Sturgis. Several are associated with members of the Vanderbilt family, including Vanderbilt Hall,[130] Phelps Hall,[131] St. Anthony Hall (a commission for member Frederick William Vanderbilt), the Mason, Sloane and Osborn laboratories, dormitories for the Sheffield Scientific School (the engineering and sciences school at Yale until 1956) and elements of Silliman College, the largest residential college.[132] The oldest building on campus, Connecticut Hall (built in 1750), is in the Georgian style. Georgian-style buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include Timothy Dwight College, Pierson College, and Davenport College, except the latter's east, York Street façade, which was constructed in the Gothic style to coordinate with adjacent structures. The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books and manuscripts. The library includes a six-story above-ground tower of book stacks, filled with 180,000 volumes, that is surrounded by large translucent Vermont marble panels and a steel and granite truss. The panels act as windows and subdue direct sunlight while also diffusing the light in warm hues throughout the interior.[133] Near the library is a sunken courtyard, with sculptures by Isamu Noguchi that are said to represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube).[134] The library is located near the center of the university in Hewitt Quadrangle, which is now more commonly referred to as ""Beinecke Plaza."" Alumnus Eero Saarinen, Finnish-American architect of such notable structures as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Washington Dulles International Airport main terminal, Bell Labs Holmdel Complex and the CBS Building in Manhattan, designed Ingalls Rink, dedicated in 1959,[135] as well as the residential colleges Ezra Stiles and Morse.[136] These latter were modeled after the medieval Italian hill town of San Gimignano – a prototype chosen for the town's pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone towers.[137] These tower forms at Yale act in counterpoint to the college's many Gothic spires and Georgian cupolas.[138] Yale's Old Campus at dusk, April 2013 Notable nonresidential campus buildings[edit] Harkness Tower Notable nonresidential campus buildings and landmarks include Battell Chapel, Beinecke Rare Book Library, Harkness Tower, Ingalls Rink, Kline Biology Tower, Osborne Memorial Laboratories, Payne Whitney Gymnasium, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Sterling Hall of Medicine, Sterling Law Buildings, Sterling Memorial Library, Woolsey Hall, Yale Center for British Art, Yale University Art Gallery, Yale Art & Architecture Building, and the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art in London. Yale's secret society buildings (some of which are called ""tombs"") were built both to be private yet unmistakable. A diversity of architectural styles is represented: Berzelius, Donn Barber in an austere cube with classical detailing (erected in 1908 or 1910); Book and Snake, Louis R. Metcalfe in a Greek Ionic style (erected in 1901); Elihu, architect unknown but built in a Colonial style (constructed on an early 17th-century foundation although the building is from the 18th century); Mace and Chain, in a late colonial, early Victorian style (built in 1823). (Interior moulding is said to have belonged to Benedict Arnold);Manuscript Society, King Lui-Wu with Dan Kniley responsible for landscaping and Josef Albers for the brickwork intaglio mural. Building constructed in a mid-century modern style; Scroll and Key, Richard Morris Hunt in a Moorish- or Islamic-inspired Beaux-Arts style (erected 1869–70); Skull and Bones, possibly Alexander Jackson Davis or Henry Austin in an Egypto-Doric style utilizing Brownstone (in 1856 the first wing was completed, in 1903 the second wing, 1911 the Neo-Gothic towers in rear garden were completed); St. Elmo, (former tomb) Kenneth M. Murchison, 1912, designs inspired by Elizabethan manor. Current location, brick colonial; and Wolf's Head, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, erected 1923–1924, Collegiate Gothic. Sustainability[edit] Yale's Office of Sustainability develops and implements sustainability practices at Yale.[139] Yale is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10% below 1990 levels by the year 2020. As part of this commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by residential colleges.[140] Eleven campus buildings are candidates for LEED design and certification.[141] Yale Sustainable Food Project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all residential college dining halls.[142] Yale was listed as a Campus Sustainability Leader on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2008, and received a ""B+"" grade overall.[143] Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven Marsh Botanical Garden Yale Sustainable Food Program Farm Relationship with New Haven[edit] Yale is the largest taxpayer and employer in the City of New Haven,[144] and has often buoyed the city's economy and communities. Yale, however has consistently opposed paying a tax on its academic property.[145] Yale's Art Galleries, along with many other university resources, are free and openly accessible. Yale also funds the New Haven Promise program, paying full tuition for eligible students from New Haven public schools.[146] Town–gown relations[edit] Yale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.[147] Campus safety[edit] Several campus safety strategies have been pioneered at Yale. The first campus police force was founded at Yale in 1894, when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus.[148][149] Later hired by the university, the officers were originally brought in to quell unrest between students and city residents and curb destructive student behavior.[150][151] In addition to the Yale Police Department, a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a safety escort, and 24-hour shuttle service. In the 1970s and 1980s, poverty and violent crime rose in New Haven, dampening Yale's student and faculty recruiting efforts.[152] Between 1990 and 2006, New Haven's crime rate fell by half, helped by a community policing strategy by the New Haven Police and Yale's campus became the safest among the Ivy League and other peer schools.[153] In 2004, the national non-profit watchdog group Security on Campus filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, accusing Yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults.[154][155] In April 2021, Yale announced that it will require students to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of being on campus during the fall 2021 term.[156] Academics[edit] Admissions[edit] Admissions statistics2020 enteringclass[157]Change vs.2015[158]Admit rate6.5% ( −0.2)Yield rate54.9% ( −12)Test scores middle 50%SAT EBRW720–780SAT Math740–800ACT Composite33–35High school GPATop 10%†94% ( −3)†Among students whose school ranked Undergraduate admission to Yale College is considered ""most selective"" by U.S. News.[159][160] In 2017, Yale accepted 2,285 students to the Class of 2021 out of 32,914 applicants, for an acceptance rate of 6.9%.[161] 98% of students graduate within six years.[162] Through its program of need-based financial aid, Yale commits to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants. Most financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not need to be paid back to the university, and the average need-based aid grant for the Class of 2017 was $46,395.[163] 15% of Yale College students are expected to have no parental contribution, and about 50% receive some form of financial aid.[162][164][165] About 16% of the Class of 2013 had some form of student loan debt at graduation, with an average debt of $13,000 among borrowers.[162] Half of all Yale undergraduates are women, more than 39% are ethnic minority U.S. citizens (19% are underrepresented minorities), and 10.5% are international students.[163] 55% attended public schools and 45% attended private, religious, or international schools, and 97% of students were in the top 10% of their high school class.[162] Every year, Yale College also admits a small group of non-traditional students through the Eli Whitney Students Program. Collections[edit] Yale University's Sterling Memorial Library, as seen from Maya Lin's sculpture, Women's Table. The sculpture records the number of women enrolled at Yale over its history; female undergraduates were not admitted until 1969. Yale University Library, which holds over 15 million volumes, is the third-largest university collection in the United States.[13][166] The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject libraries. Rare books are found in several Yale collections. The Beinecke Rare Book Library has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The Lewis Walpole Library contains the largest collection of 18th‑century British literary works. The Elizabethan Club, technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale. The Night Café, Vincent van Gogh, 1888, Yale Art Gallery Yale's museum collections are also of international stature. The Yale University Art Gallery, the country's first university-affiliated art museum, contains more than 200,000 works, including Old Masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartwout and Kahn buildings. The latter, Louis Kahn's first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The Yale Center for British Art, the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of Paul Mellon and is housed in another Kahn-designed building. The Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments, affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of Yale's collections because its hours of opening are restricted. The museums once housed the artifacts brought to the United States from Peru by Yale history professor Hiram Bingham in his Yale-financed expedition to Machu Picchu in 1912 – when the removal of such artifacts was legal. The artifacts were restored to Peru in 2012.[167] Academic rankings National ARWU[168] 9 Forbes[169] 3 THE/WSJ[170] 3 U.S. News & World Report[171] 4 Washington Monthly[172] 4 Global ARWU[173] 11 QS[174] 14 THE[175] 8 U.S. News & World Report[176] 11 USNWR graduate school rankings[177] Business 9 Engineering 39 Law 1 Medicine: Primary Care 49 Medicine: Research 15 Nursing: Doctorate 17 Nursing: Master's 14 Rankings[edit] USNWR departmental rankings[177] Biological Sciences 6 Chemistry 9 Clinical Psychology 18 Computer Science 20 Earth Sciences 13 Economics 1 English 8 Fine Arts 2 History 1 Mathematics 9 Nursing–Midwifery 2 Physician Assistant 26 Physics 12 Political Science 4 Psychology 3 Public Health 15 Sociology 22 Statistics 31 The U.S. News & World Report ranked Yale 3rd among U.S. national universities for 2016,[159] as it had for each of the previous sixteen years.

(March 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Yale is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) and is classified among ""R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity"".[184] According to the National Science Foundation, Yale spent $990 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 15th in the nation.[185] Yale's faculty include 61 members of the National Academy of Sciences,[186] 7 members of the National Academy of Engineering[187] and 49 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The college is, after normalization for institution size, the tenth-largest baccalaureate source of doctoral degree recipients in the United States, and the largest such source within the Ivy League.[188] Yale's English and Comparative Literature departments were part of the New Criticism movement. Of the New Critics, Robert Penn Warren, W.K. Wimsatt, and Cleanth Brooks were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American deconstruction. Jacques Derrida, the father of deconstruction, taught at the Department of Comparative Literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called ""Yale School"". These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C. Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, David Montgomery, a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th century. The Journal of Music Theory was founded there in 1957; Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and scholars. In addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 Postdocs from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the Yale Postdoctoral Association. Campus life[edit] Yale is a research university, with the majority of its students in the graduate and professional schools. Undergraduates, or Yale College students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010–2011 freshman class, 10% are non‑U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.[189] The median family income of Yale students is $192,600, with 57% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 16% from the bottom 60%.[190] Residential colleges[edit] Main article: Residential colleges of Yale University Yale's residential college system was established in 1933 by Edward S. Harkness, who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as ""Master's Teas,"" but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college. All undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.[191] While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the Old Campus, the university's oldest precinct. While Harkness' original colleges were Georgian Revival or Collegiate Gothic in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history. In 2017, the university opened two new colleges near Science Hill.[192] Jonathan Edwards College courtyard Branford College courtyard Saybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard Hopper College courtyard Berkeley College buildings Trumbull College courtyard Davenport College courtyard Pierson College courtyard Silliman College courtyard Timothy Dwight College courtyard Morse College courtyard Ezra Stiles College courtyard Benjamin Franklin College courtyard Pauli Murray College courtyard Calhoun College[edit] Since the 1960s, John C. Calhoun's white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership[193][194][195][196] had prompted calls to rename the college or remove its tributes to Calhoun. The racially motivated church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, led to renewed calls in the summer of 2015 for Calhoun College, one of 12 residential colleges, to be renamed. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change.[194] They argued in the petition that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an ""extraordinary American statesman""—he was ""one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy"" in the history of the United States.[194][195] In August 2015 Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed.[196] He described Calhoun as ""a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina"".[196] He acknowledged that Calhoun also ""believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude. Not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests.""[193] Student activism about this issue increased in the fall of 2015, and included further protests sparked by controversy surrounding an administrator's comments on the potential positive and negative implications of students who wear Halloween costumes that are culturally sensitive.[197] Campus-wide discussions expanded to include critical discussion of the experiences of women of color on campus, and the realities of racism in undergraduate life.[198] The protests were sensationalized by the media and led to the labelling of some students as being members of Generation Snowflake.[199] In April 2016 Salovey announced that ""despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests,"" Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college[200] explaining that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun's ""shadow"" so they will be ""better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future"". He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would ""obscure"" his ""legacy of slavery rather than addressing it"".[200] ""Yale is part of that history"" and ""We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it."" One change that will be issued is the title of ""master"" for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to ""head of college"" due to its connotation of slavery.[201] Despite this apparently conclusive reasoning, Salovey announced that Calhoun College would be renamed for groundbreaking computer scientist Grace Murray Hopper in February 2017.[202] This renaming decision received a range of responses from Yale students and alumni.[203][204][205] Student organizations[edit] In 2014, Yale had 385 registered student organizations, plus an additional one hundred groups in the process of registration.[206] The university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. Established in 1872, The Yale Record is the world's oldest humor magazine. Newspapers include the Yale Daily News, which was first published in 1878, and the weekly Yale Herald, which was first published in 1986. The Yale Journal of Medicine & Law is a biannual magazine that explores the intersection of law and medicine. Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in New Haven. The Yale College Council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. The Yale Dramatic Association and Bulldog Productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. In addition, the Yale Drama Coalition[207] serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio[208] is the campus's radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM and FM frequencies, they now have an Internet-only stream. The Yale College Council (YCC) serves as the campus's undergraduate student government. All registered student organizations are regulated and funded by a subsidiary organization of the YCC, known as the Undergraduate Organizations Funding Committee (UOFC).[209] The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) serves as Yale's graduate and professional student government. The Yale Political Union is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry and George Pataki. The Yale International Relations Association (YIRA) functions as the umbrella organization for the top-ranked Model UN team. YIRA also has a Europe-based offshoot, Yale Model Government Europe, other Model UN conferences such as YMUN Korea or YMUN Taiwan, and educational programs such as the Yale Review of International Relations (YRIS), YMUN Institute, or Hemispheres. The campus includes several fraternities and sororities. The campus features at least 18 a cappella groups, the most famous of which is The Whiffenpoofs, which from its founding in 1909 until 2018 was made up solely of senior men. Yale's secret societies include Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, Wolf's Head, Book and Snake, Elihu, Berzelius, St. Elmo, Manuscript, Shabtai, Myth and Sword, Mace and Chain and Sage and Chalice. The two oldest existing honor societies are the Aurelian (1910) and the Torch Honor Society (1916).[210] The Elizabethan Club, a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. Membership is by invitation. Members and their guests may enter the ""Lizzie's"" premises for conversation and tea. The club owns first editions of a Shakespeare Folio, several Shakespeare Quartos, and a first edition of Milton's Paradise Lost, among other important literary texts. Traditions[edit] See also: Bladderball Yale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their ""bright college years,"" though in recent history the pipes have been replaced with ""bubble pipes"".[211][212] (""Bright College Years,"" the university's alma mater, was penned in 1881 by Henry Durand, Class of 1881, to the tune of Die Wacht am Rhein.) Yale's student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus; however, actual students rarely do so.[213] In the second half of the 20th century Bladderball, a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009, 2011, and 2014.[214][215][216] Athletic[edit] Main article: Yale Bulldogs The Yale Bowl, the college football stadium located near Yale University Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference, the Eastern College Athletic Conference, the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association. Yale athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the NCAA Division I level. Like other members of the Ivy League, Yale does not offer athletic scholarships. Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Yale Bowl (the nation's first natural ""bowl"" stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl), located at The Walter Camp Field athletic complex, and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world.[217] In May 2018, the men's lacrosse team defeated the Duke Blue Devils to claim their first ever NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship,[218] and are the first Ivy League school to win the title since the Princeton Tigers in 2001.[219] In 2016, the men's basketball team won the Ivy League Championship title for the first time in 54 years, earning a spot in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In the first round of the tournament, the Bulldogs beat the Baylor Bears 79–75 in the school's first-ever tournament win.[220] The Walter Camp Gate at the Yale Athletic Complex October 21, 2000, marked the dedication of Yale's fourth new boathouse in 157 years of collegiate rowing. The Gilder Boathouse is named to honor former Olympic rower Virginia Gilder '79 and her father Richard Gilder '54, who gave $4 million towards the $7.5 million project. Yale also maintains the Gales Ferry site where the heavyweight men's team trains for the Yale-Harvard Boat Race. Yale crew is the oldest collegiate athletic team in America, and won Olympic Games Gold Medal for men's eights in 1924 and 1956. The Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate sailing club in the world. In 1896, Yale and Johns Hopkins played the first known ice hockey game in the United States. Since 2006, the school's ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game.[221] Yale students claim to have invented Frisbee, by tossing empty Frisbie Pie Company tins.[222][223] Yale athletics are supported by the Yale Precision Marching Band. ""Precision"" is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching.[224] The band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter. Yale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about ten different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup. Song[edit] Notable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement, convocation, alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, ""Bright College Years"". Despite its popularity, ""Boola Boola"" is not the official fight song, albeit being the origin of the university's unofficial motto. The official Yale fight song, ""Bulldog"" was written by Cole Porter during his undergraduate days and is sung after touchdowns during a football game.[225] Additionally, two other songs, ""Down the Field"" by C.W. O'Conner, and ""Bingo Eli Yale"", also by Cole Porter, are still sung at football games. According to College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology published in 1998, ""Down the Field"" ranks as the fourth-greatest fight song of all time.[226] Mascot[edit] The school mascot is ""Handsome Dan,"" the Yale bulldog, and the Yale fight song contains the refrain, ""Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow"". The school color, since 1894, is Yale Blue.[227] Yale's Handsome Dan is believed to be the first college mascot in America, having been established in 1889.[228] Notable people[edit] Benefactors[edit] Yale has had many financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. Among those who have made large donations commemorated at the university are: Elihu Yale; Jeremiah Dummer; the Harkness family (Edward, Anna, and William); the Beinecke family (Edwin, Frederick, and Walter); John William Sterling; Payne Whitney; Joseph Earl Sheffield, Paul Mellon, Charles B. G. Murphy, Joseph Tsai, and William K. Lanman. The Yale Class of 1954, led by Richard Gilder, donated $70 million in commemoration of their 50th reunion.[229] Charles B. Johnson, a 1954 graduate of Yale College, pledged a $250 million gift in 2013 to support the construction of two new residential colleges.[230] The colleges have been named respectively in honor of Pauli Murray and Benjamin Franklin. A $100 million contribution[231] by Stephen Adams enabled the Yale School of Music to become tuition-free and the Adams Center for Musical Arts to be built.

For undergraduate institutions, “top-tier” typically included only Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Stanford, and potentially Wharton (University of Pennsylvania’s Business School).

Yale University reinstitutes face covering policy NEW HAVEN, CT (WFSB) - Yale University has reinstituted their mask mandate. On Monday, Quinnipiac University said it too will require the community, regardless of vaccination status, to wear a face mask inside at all indoor campus spaces.“Following are the only times it is not needed to wear a face mask: When outdoors; when alone in a private office or a partitioned cubicle/workspace, or in your living space; When eating in dining halls (masks must be worn at all other times in dining halls),” a letter to students said.Also on Monday, the University of New Haven said based on the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control, the Dept. of Public Health, and due to the increases in COVID transmission rates, all individuals will be required to wear face coverings when inside any university building, regardless of vaccination status.UNH officials said they will reassess the need for indoor masks weekly, based on the latest federal and state guidance. ""We’re checking to see what’s the appropriate to take, and we’ll continue to have that conversation so that districts can have that information as soon as possible,"" Acting Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker of the Dept. of Education said. As college students prepare to return to campus, more institutions are bringing back a mask mandate, including the University of New Haven. Colleges and universities are not alone in bringing back mask mandates. Many cities and towns across the state are requiring the public to wear a mask or face covering when inside municipal buildings.The University of Connecticut already has a universal mask policy in place at all of its campuses.Under the policy, all students, faculty, staff, and visitors are required to wear face coverings indoors, regardless of their vaccination status.School officials said that the mask policy will remain in effect for the Fall semester.

It is located on New Haven Harbor on the northern shore of Long Island Sound in New Haven County, Connecticut, and is part of the New York metropolitan area. With a population of 129,779 as determined by the 2010 United States Census,[3] it is the second-largest city in Connecticut after Bridgeport. New Haven is the principal municipality of Greater New Haven, which had a total population of 862,477 in 2010.[4] New Haven was one of the first planned cities in America.[5][6][7] A year after its founding by English Puritans in 1638, eight streets were laid out in a four-by-four grid, creating what is commonly known as the ""Nine Square Plan"".[8] The central common block is the New Haven Green, a 16-acre (6 ha) square at the center of Downtown New Haven. The Green is now a National Historic Landmark, and the ""Nine Square Plan"" is recognized by the American Planning Association as a National Planning Landmark.[9][10] New Haven is the home of Yale University. As New Haven's biggest taxpayer and employer,[11] Yale serves as an integral part of the city's economy. Health care (hospitals and biotechnology), professional services (legal, architectural, marketing, and engineering), financial services, and retail trade also contribute to the city's economic activity. The city served as co-capital of Connecticut from 1701 until 1873, when sole governance was transferred to the more centrally located city of Hartford. New Haven has since billed itself as the ""Cultural Capital of Connecticut"" for its supply of established theaters, museums, and music venues.[12] New Haven had the first public tree planting program in America, producing a canopy of mature trees (including some large elms) that gave the city the nickname ""The Elm City"".[13] Contents 1 History 1.1 Pre-colonial foundation as an independent colony 1.2 As part of the Connecticut Colony 1.3 Post-colonial period and industrialization 1.4 Post-industrial era and urban redevelopment 1.5 Timeline of notable firsts 2 Geography 2.1 Climate 2.2 Streetscape 2.3 Neighborhoods 3 Economy 3.1 Headquarters 4 Demographics 4.1 Census data 4.2 Other data 5 Law and Government 5.1 Political structure 5.2 Political history 5.3 Crime 6 Education 6.1 Colleges and universities 6.2 Primary and secondary schools 7 Culture 7.1 Cuisine 7.2 Theatre and film 7.3 Museums 7.4 Music 7.5 Festivals 7.6 Nightlife 7.7 Newspapers and media 7.8 Sports and athletics 8 Structures 8.1 Architecture 8.2 Historic points of interest 9 Transportation 9.1 Rail 9.2 Bus 9.3 Bicycle 9.3.1 Bikeshare 9.3.2 Bike lanes 9.3.3 Farmington Canal Greenway 9.4 Roads 9.5 Airport 9.6 Seaport 10 Infrastructure 10.1 Hospitals and medicine 10.2 Power supply facilities 11 In popular culture 12 Notable people 13 Sister cities 14 See also 15 References 16 Further reading 17 External links History[edit] Pre-colonial foundation as an independent colony[edit] Before Europeans arrived, the New Haven area was the home of the Quinnipiac tribe of Native Americans, who lived in villages around the harbor and subsisted off local fisheries and the farming of maize. The area was briefly visited by Dutch explorer Adriaen Block in 1614. Dutch traders set up a small trading system of beaver pelts with the local inhabitants, but trade was sporadic and the Dutch did not settle permanently in the area. The 1638 nine-square plan, with the extant New Haven Green at its center, continues to define New Haven's downtown In 1637 a small party of Puritans reconnoitered the New Haven harbor area and wintered over. In April 1638, the main party of five hundred Puritans who had left the Massachusetts Bay Colony under the leadership of Reverend John Davenport and London merchant Theophilus Eaton sailed into the harbor. It was their hope to set up a theological community with the government more closely linked to the church than that in Massachusetts, and to exploit the area's excellent potential as a port. The Quinnipiacs, who were under attack by neighboring Pequots, sold their land to the settlers in return for protection. Wikisource has original text related to this article: Government of New Haven Colony House of New Haven Founder Theophilus Eaton as it stood at Orange and Elm streets in the 17th Century By 1640, ""Quinnipiac's"" theocratic government and nine-square grid plan were in place, and the town was renamed Newhaven, with 'haven' meaning harbor or port. (However, the area to the north remained Quinnipiac until 1678, when it was renamed Hamden.) The settlement became the headquarters of the New Haven Colony, distinct from the Connecticut Colony previously established to the north centering on Hartford. Reflecting its theocratic roots, the New Haven Colony forbid the establishment of other churches, whereas the Connecticut Colony permitted them. Economic disaster struck Newhaven in 1646, when the town sent its first fully loaded ship of local goods back to England. It never reached its destination, and its disappearance stymied New Haven's development versus the rising trade powers of Boston and New Amsterdam. In 1660, Colony founder John Davenport's wishes were fulfilled, and Hopkins School was founded in New Haven with money from the estate of Edward Hopkins. In 1661, the Regicides who had signed the death warrant of Charles I of England were pursued by Charles II. Two of them, Colonel Edward Whalley and Colonel William Goffe, fled to New Haven for refuge. Davenport arranged for them to hide in the West Rock hills northwest of the town. Later a third judge, John Dixwell, joined the others. As part of the Connecticut Colony[edit] New Haven as it appeared in a 1786 engraving Second meeting house on the New Haven Green, as it stood from 1670 to 1757 In 1664 New Haven became part of the Connecticut Colony when the two colonies were merged under political pressure from England. Some members of the New Haven Colony seeking to establish a new theocracy elsewhere went on to establish Newark, New Jersey. Connecticut Hall, built 1750–1756, is the oldest extant building at Yale It was made co-capital of Connecticut in 1701, a status it retained until 1873. In 1716, the Collegiate School relocated from Old Saybrook to New Haven, establishing New Haven as a center of learning. In 1718, in response to a large donation from East India Company merchant Elihu Yale, former Governor of Madras, the name of the Collegiate School was changed to Yale College.[citation needed] For over a century, New Haven citizens had fought in the colonial militia alongside regular British forces, as in the French and Indian War. As the American Revolution approached, General David Wooster and other influential residents hoped that the conflict with the government in Britain could be resolved short of rebellion. On 23 April 1775, which is still celebrated in New Haven as Powder House Day, the Second Company, Governor's Foot Guard, of New Haven entered the struggle against the British parliament. Under Captain Benedict Arnold, they broke into the powder house to arm themselves and began a three-day march to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Other New Haven militia members were on hand to escort George Washington from his overnight stay in New Haven on his way to Cambridge. Contemporary reports, from both sides, remark on the New Haven volunteers' professional military bearing, including uniforms. On July 5, 1779, 2,600 loyalists and British regulars under General William Tryon, governor of New York, landed in New Haven Harbor and raided the 3,500-person town. A militia of Yale students had been preparing for battle, and former Yale president and Yale Divinity School professor Naphtali Daggett rode out to confront the Redcoats. Yale president Ezra Stiles recounted in his diary that while he moved furniture in anticipation of battle, he still couldn't quite believe the revolution had begun.[14] New Haven was not torched as the invaders did with Danbury in 1777, or Fairfield and Norwalk a week after the New Haven raid, so many of the town's colonial features were preserved. Post-colonial period and industrialization[edit] New Haven was incorporated as a city in 1784, and Roger Sherman, one of the signers of the Constitution and author of the ""Connecticut Compromise"", became the new city's first mayor.

That area is still known as Whitneyville, and the main road through both towns is known as Whitney Avenue. The factory is now the Eli Whitney Museum, which has a particular emphasis on activities for children and exhibits pertaining to the A. C. Gilbert Company. His factory, along with that of Simeon North, and the lively clock-making and brass hardware sectors, contributed to making early Connecticut a powerful manufacturing economy; so many arms manufacturers sprang up that the state became known as ""The Arsenal of America"". It was in Whitney's gun-manufacturing plant that Samuel Colt invented the automatic revolver in 1836. Many other talented machinists and firearms designers would go on to found successful firearms manufacturing companies in New Haven, including Oliver Winchester and O.F. Mossberg & Sons. The Farmington Canal, created in the early 19th century, was a short-lived transporter of goods into the interior regions of Connecticut and Massachusetts, and ran from New Haven to Northampton, Massachusetts. Site of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, which has since 1981 been converted to Science Park at Yale, a complex for start-ups and technological firms New Haven was home to one of the important early events in the burgeoning anti-slavery movement when, in 1839, the trial of mutineering Mende tribesmen being transported as slaves on the Spanish slaveship Amistad was held in New Haven's United States District Court.[16] There is a statue of Joseph Cinqué, the informal leader of the slaves, beside City Hall. See ""Museums"" below for more information. Abraham Lincoln delivered a speech on slavery in New Haven in 1860,[17] shortly before he secured the Republican nomination for President. The American Civil War boosted the local economy with wartime purchases of industrial goods, including that of the New Haven Arms Company, which would later become the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. (Winchester would continue to produce arms in New Haven until 2006, and many of the buildings that were a part of the Winchester plant are now a part of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company Historic District).[18] After the war, population grew and doubled by the start of the 20th century, most notably due to the influx of immigrants from southern Europe, particularly Italy. Today, roughly half the populations of East Haven, West Haven, and North Haven are Italian-American. Jewish immigration to New Haven has left an enduring mark on the city. Westville was the center of Jewish life in New Haven, though today many have fanned out to suburban communities such as Woodbridge and Cheshire. Post-industrial era and urban redevelopment[edit] The historic New Haven Green, ca. 1919 New Haven's expansion continued during the two World Wars, with most new inhabitants being African Americans from the American South and Puerto Ricans. The city reached its peak population after World War II. The area of New Haven is only 17 square miles (44 km2), encouraging further development of new housing after 1950 in adjacent, suburban towns. Moreover, as in other U.S. cities in the 1950s, New Haven began to suffer white flight of middle-class workers. One author suggested that aggressive redlining and rezoning made it difficult for residents to obtain financing for older, deteriorating urban housing stock, thereby condemning such structures to deterioration.[19][additional citation(s) needed] In 1954; then-mayor Richard C. Lee began some of the earliest major urban renewal projects in the United States. Certain sections of downtown New Haven were redeveloped to include museums, new office towers, a hotel, and large shopping complexes.[20] Other parts of the city, particularly the Wooster Square and Fair Haven neighborhoods were affected by the construction of Interstate 95 along the Long Wharf section, Interstate 91, and the Oak Street Connector. The Oak Street Connector (Route 34), running between Interstate 95, downtown, and The Hill neighborhood, was originally intended as a highway to the city's western suburbs but was only completed as a highway to the downtown area, with the area to the west becoming a boulevard (See ""Redevelopment"" below). In 1970, a series of criminal prosecutions against various members of the Black Panther Party took place in New Haven, inciting mass protests on the New Haven Green involving twelve thousand demonstrators and many well-known New Left political activists. (See ""Political Culture"" below for more information). From the 1960s through the late 1990s, central areas of New Haven continued to decline both economically and in terms of population despite attempts to resurrect certain neighborhoods through renewal projects. In conjunction with its declining population, New Haven experienced a steep rise in its crime rate. The Connecticut Financial Center, completed in 1990, is the tallest building in New Haven Since approximately 2000, many parts of downtown New Haven have been revitalized with new restaurants, nightlife, and small retail stores. In particular, the area surrounding the New Haven Green has experienced an influx of apartments and condominiums. In recent years, downtown retail options have increased with the opening of new stores such as Urban Oufitters, J Crew, Origins, American Apparel, Gant Clothing, and an Apple Store, joining older stores such as Barnes & Noble and Raggs Clothing. In addition, two new supermarkets opened to serve downtown's growing residential population. A Stop & Shop opened just west of downtown, while Elm City Market, located one block from the Green, opened in 2011.[21] The recent turnaround of downtown New Haven has received positive press from various periodicals.[22][23][24] Whitney Avenue, one of downtown New Haven's principal commercial corridors Major projects include the current construction of a new campus for Gateway Community College downtown, and also a 32-story, 500-unit apartment/retail building called 360 State Street. The 360 State Street project is now occupied and is the largest residential building in Connecticut.[25] A new boathouse and dock is planned for New Haven Harbor, and the linear park Farmington Canal Trail is set to extend into downtown New Haven within the coming year.[26] Additionally, foundation and ramp work to widen I-95 to create a new harbor crossing for New Haven, with an extradosed bridge to replace the 1950s-era Q Bridge, has begun.[27] The city still hopes to redevelop the site of the New Haven Coliseum, which was demolished in 2007. Recent decades have brought increased commercial activity to much of New Haven, including this stretch of upper State Street In April 2009, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear a suit over reverse discrimination brought by 18 white firefighters against the city. The suit involved the 2003 promotion test for the New Haven Fire Department. After the tests were scored, no black firefighters scored high enough to qualify for consideration for promotion, so the city announced that no one would be promoted. In the subsequent Ricci v. DeStefano decision the court found 5-4 that New Haven's decision to ignore the test results violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[28] As a result, a district court subsequently ordered the city to promote 14 of the white firefighters.[29] In 2010 and 2011, state and federal funds were awarded to Connecticut (and Massachusetts) to construct the Hartford Line, with a southern terminus at New Haven's Union Station and a northern terminus at Springfield's Union Station.[30] According to the White House, ""This corridor [currently] has one train per day connecting communities in Connecticut and Massachusetts to the Northeast Corridor and Vermont. The vision for this corridor is to restore the alignment to its original route via the Knowledge Corridor in western Massachusetts, improving trip time and increasing the population base that can be served.""[31] Set for construction in 2013, the ""Knowledge Corridor high speed intercity passenger rail"" project will cost approximately $1 billion, and the ultimate northern terminus for the project is reported to be Montreal in Canada.[32] Train speeds between will reportedly exceed 110 miles per hour (180 km/h) and increase both cities' rail traffic exponentially.[33] Timeline of notable firsts[edit] The world's first phonebook was made in New Haven in 1878. See also: Yale – New Haven Hospital § Milestones in medicine 1638: New Haven becomes the first planned city in America. 1776: Yale student David Bushnell invents the first American submarine. 1787: John Fitch builds the first steamboat. 1793: Eli Whitney invents the cotton gin. 1836: Samuel Colt invents the automatic revolver in Whitney's factory. 1839: Charles Goodyear of New Haven discovers the process of vulcanizing rubber in Woburn, Massachusetts, and later perfects it and patents the process in nearby Springfield, Massachusetts.[34] 1860: Philios P. Blake patents the first corkscrew. 1877: New Haven hosts the first Bell PSTN (telephone) switch office. 1878–1880: The District Telephone Company of New Haven creates the world's first telephone exchange and the first telephone directory and installs the first public phone. The company expanded and became the Connecticut Telephone Company, then the Southern New England Telephone Company (now part of AT&T).[35] 1882: The Knights of Columbus are founded in New Haven. The city still serves as the world headquarters of the organization, which maintains a museum downtown.[36] 1892: Local confectioner George C. Smith of the Bradley Smith Candy Co. invents the first lollipops.[37] Late 19th century-early 20th century: The first public tree planting program takes place in New Haven, at the urging of native James Hillhouse.[38] 1900: Louis Lassen, owner of Louis' Lunch, is credited with inventing the hamburger, as well as the steak sandwich.[39] 1911: The Erector Set, the popular and culturally important construction toy, is invented in New Haven by A.C. Gilbert. It was manufactured by the A. C. Gilbert Company at Erector Square from 1913 until the company's bankruptcy in 1967.[40] 1920: In competition with competing explanations, the Frisbee is said to have originated on the Yale campus, based on the tin pans of the Frisbie Pie Company which were tossed around by students on the New Haven Green.[41] 1977: The first memorial to victims of the Holocaust on public land in America[42] stands in New Haven's Edgewood Park at the corner of Whalley and West Park avenues. It was built with funds collected from the community[43] and is maintained by Greater New Haven Holocaust Memory, Inc.[44] The ashes of victims killed and cremated at Auschwitz are buried under the memorial.[42] Geography[edit] View of the Quinnipiac River from Fair Haven Map of towns in the New Haven area According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 20.1 square miles (52.1 km2), of which 18.7 square miles (48.4 km2) is land and 1.4 square miles (3.7 km2), or 6.67%, is water.[45] New Haven's best-known geographic features are its large, shallow harbor, and two reddish basalt trap rock ridges which rise to the northeast and northwest of the city core. These trap rocks are known respectively as East Rock and West Rock, and both serve as extensive parks. West Rock has been tunneled through to make way for the east–west passage of the Wilbur Cross Parkway (the only highway tunnel through a natural obstacle in Connecticut), and once served as the hideout of the ""Regicides"" (see: Regicides Trail). Most New Haveners refer to these men as ""The Three Judges"". East Rock features the prominent Soldiers and Sailors war monument on its peak as well as the ""Great/Giant Steps"" which run up the rock's cliffside. The city is drained by three rivers; the West, Mill, and Quinnipiac, named in order from west to east. The West River discharges into West Haven Harbor, while the Mill and Quinnipiac rivers discharge into New Haven Harbor. Both harbors are embayments of Long Island Sound. In addition, several smaller streams flow through the city's neighborhoods, including Wintergreen Brook, the Beaver Ponds Outlet, Wilmot Brook, Belden Brook, and Prospect Creek. Not all of these small streams have continuous flow year-round. Climate[edit] According to the Köppen classification, New Haven is cfa, or a Temperate climate. The city has hot, humid summers and cool to cold winters. From May to late September, the weather is typically hot and humid, with average temperatures exceeding 80 °F (27 °C) on 70 days per year. In summer, the Bermuda High creates as southern flow of warm and humid air, with frequent thundershowers. October to early December is normally mild to cool late in the season, while early spring (April) can be cool to warm. Winters are moderately cold with both rain and snow fall. The weather patterns that affect New Haven result from a primarily offshore direction, thus reducing the marine influence of Long Island Sound—although, like other marine areas, differences in temperature between areas right along the coastline and areas a mile or two inland can be large at times. During summer heat waves, temperatures may reach 95 °F (35 °C) or higher on occasion with heat-index values of over 100 °F (38 °C). Tropical cyclones have struck New Haven in the past, including 1938 Hurricane (Long Island Express), Hurricane Carol in 1954, Hurricane Gloria in 1985.[citation needed] Climate data for New Haven (HVN), elevation: 4 m or 13 ft, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1948–present Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °F (°C) 69(21) 67(19) 77(25) 87(31) 92(33) 96(36) 101(38) 100(38) 82(28) 89(32) 76(24) 65(18) 101(38) Mean maximum °F (°C) 56(13) 55(13) 64(18) 77(25) 83(28) 88(31) 91(33) 90(32) 86(30) 78(26) 68(20) 59(15) 92(33) Average high °F (°C) 38.1(3.4) 40.2(4.6) 47.0(8.3) 57.8(14.3) 67.7(19.8) 76.4(24.7) 82.1(27.8) 81.0(27.2) 74.7(23.7) 63.8(17.7) 53.4(11.9) 43.7(6.5) 60.5(15.8) Daily mean °F (°C) 30.5(−0.8) 32.0(0.0) 38.5(3.6) 48.5(9.2) 58.5(14.7) 67.9(19.9) 73.9(23.3) 72.9(22.7) 66.0(18.9) 54.7(12.6) 44.7(7.1) 36.3(2.4) 52.0(11.1) Average low °F (°C) 23.0(−5.0) 23.9(−4.5) 30.1(−1.1) 39.3(4.1) 49.4(9.7) 59.3(15.2) 65.7(18.7) 64.7(18.2) 57.3(14.1) 45.5(7.5) 35.9(2.2) 28.9(−1.7) 43.9(6.6) Mean minimum °F (°C) 5(−15) 9(−13) 16(−9) 27(−3) 38(3) 48(9) 57(14) 54(12) 45(7) 31(−1) 22(−6) 15(−9) 6(−14) Record low °F (°C) −8(−22) −6(−21) 1(−17) 17(−8) 30(−1) 40(4) 50(10) 43(6) 34(1) 23(−5) 13(−11) −3(−19) −8(−22) Average precipitation inches (mm) 2.72(69) 2.84(72) 3.66(93) 4.19(106) 3.54(90) 3.47(88) 3.36(85) 3.55(90) 4.03(102) 3.78(96) 3.12(79) 3.53(90) 41.79(1,061) Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) 9.5 8.5 9.6 10.9 12.9 11.8 10.4 9.9 9.3 11.1 9.4 11.0 124.3 Average relative humidity (%) 62.8 60.3 64.4 65.1 69.7 73.8 74.2 73.8 74.1 70.4 68.2 63.6 68.4 Average ultraviolet index 2 2 4 6 7 8 8 8 6 4 2 1 5 Source 1: NOAA[46][47] Source 2: Weatherbase (humidity),[48] Weather Atlas (UV index)[49] Streetscape[edit] The city from the south with The Hill in the foreground. East Rock is visible in the background. American Elm in New Haven New Haven has a long tradition of urban planning and a purposeful design for the city's layout.[50] The city could be argued to have some of the first preconceived layouts in the country.[51][52] Upon founding, New Haven was laid out in a grid plan of nine square blocks; the central square was left open, in the tradition of many New England towns, as the city green (a commons area). The city also instituted the first public tree planting program in America. As in other cities, many of the elms that gave New Haven the nickname ""Elm City"" perished in the mid-20th century due to Dutch elm disease, although many have since been replanted. The New Haven Green is currently home to three separate historic churches which speak to the original theocratic nature of the city.[8] The Green remains the social center of the city today. It was named a National Historic Landmark in 1970. Downtown New Haven, occupied by nearly 7,000 residents, has a more residential character than most downtowns.[53] The downtown area provides about half of the city's jobs and half of its tax base[53] and in recent years has become filled with dozens of new upscale restaurants, in addition to shops and thousands of apartments and condominium units which subsequently help overall growth of the city.[54] Neighborhoods[edit] The Quinnipiac River Historic District, located in the Fair Haven neighborhood, is one of dozens of listed historic districts in New Haven. Main article: Neighborhoods of New Haven, Connecticut The city has many distinct neighborhoods. In addition to Downtown, centered on the central business district and the Green, are the following neighborhoods: the west central neighborhoods of Dixwell and Dwight; the southern neighborhoods of The Hill, historic water-front City Point (or Oyster Point), and the harborside district of Long Wharf; the western neighborhoods of Beaver Hills, Edgewood, West River, Westville, Amity, and West Rock-Westhills; East Rock, Cedar Hill, Prospect Hill, and Newhallville in the northern side of town; the east central neighborhoods of Mill River and Wooster Square, an Italian-American neighborhood; Fair Haven, an immigrant community located between the Mill and Quinnipiac rivers; Quinnipiac Meadows and Fair Haven Heights across the Quinnipiac River; and facing the eastern side of the harbor, The Annex and East Shore (or Morris Cove).[55][56][57][58] Economy[edit] Data from City-Data.com[59] The Port of New Haven New Haven's economy originally was based in manufacturing, but the postwar period brought rapid industrial decline; the entire Northeast was affected, and medium-sized cities with large working-class populations, like New Haven, were hit particularly hard. Simultaneously, the growth and expansion of Yale University further affected the economic shift. Today, over half (56%) of the city's economy is now made up of services, in particular education and health care; Yale is the city's largest employer, followed by Yale – New Haven Hospital. Other large employers include Southern Connecticut State University, Assa Abloy lock manufacturing, the Knights of Columbus headquarters, Higher One, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Covidien and United Illuminating.[60] Clothing stores Gant and Ann Taylor were founded in the city. In 2017, New Haven was ranked by a Verizon study as one of the top 10 cities in America for launching tech startups, and top two in New England.[61] Industry sectors: Agriculture (.6%), Construction and Mining (4.9%), Manufacturing (2.9%), Transportation and Utilities (2.9%), Trade (21.7%), Finance and Real Estate (7.1%), Services (55.9%), Government (4.0%) Headquarters[edit] The Knights of Columbus, the world's largest Catholic fraternal service organization and a Fortune 1000 company, is headquartered in New Haven.[62] Two more Fortune 1000 companies are based in Greater New Haven: the electrical equipment producers Hubbell Incorporated, based in Orange,[63] and Amphenol, based in Wallingford.[64] Eight Courant 100 companies are based in Greater New Haven, with four headquartered in New Haven proper.[65] New Haven-based companies traded on stock exchanges include NewAlliance Bank, the second largest bank in Connecticut and fourth-largest in New England (NYSE: NAL), Higher One Holdings (NYSE: ONE), a financial services firm United Illuminating, the electricity distributor for southern Connecticut (NYSE: UIL), Achillion Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: ACHN), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), and Transpro Inc. (AMEX: TPR). Vion Pharmaceuticals is traded OTC (OTC BB: VIONQ.OB). Other notable companies based in the city include the Peter Paul Candy Manufacturing Company (the candy-making division of the Hershey Company), and the American division of Assa Abloy (one of the world's leading manufacturers of locks). The Southern New England Telephone Company (SNET) began operations in the city as the District Telephone Company of New Haven in 1878; the company remains headquartered in New Haven as a subsidiary of Frontier Communications and provides telephone service for all but two municipalities in Connecticut.[66] SeeClickFix was founded and has been headquartered in the city since 2007.

The population density was 6,859.8 people per square mile (2,648.6/km2). There were 52,941 housing units at an average density of 2,808.5 per square mile (1,084.4/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 42.6% White, 35.4% African American, 0.5% Native American, 4.6% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 12.9% from other races, and 3.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 27.4% of the population.[68] Non-Hispanic Whites were 31.8% of the population in 2010,[69] down from 69.6% in 1970.[70] The city's demography is shifting rapidly: New Haven has always been a city of immigrants and the Latino population is growing rapidly. Previous influxes among ethnic groups have been African-Americans in the postwar era, and Irish, Italian and (to a lesser degree) Slavic peoples in the prewar period. As of the 2010 census, of the 47,094 households, 29.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 27.5% include married couples living together, 22.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 45.1% were non-families. 36.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.40 and the average family size 3.19.[71][72] The ages of New Haven's residents were 25.4% under the age of 18, 16.4% from 18 to 24, 31.2% from 25 to 44, 16.7% from 45 to 64, and 10.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 29 years, which was significantly lower than the national average. There were 91.8 males per 100 females. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.6 males. The median income for a household in the city was $29,604, and the median income for a family was $35,950. Median income for males was $33,605, compared with $28,424 for females. The per capita income for the city was $16,393. About 20.5% of families and 24.4% of the population were living below the poverty line, including 32.2% of those under age 18 and 17.9% of those age 65 or over.[71][72] Other data[edit] It is estimated that 14% of New Haven residents are pedestrian commuters, ranking it number four by highest percentage in the United States. This is primarily due to New Haven's small area and the presence of Yale University. New Haven is noted for having the highest percentage of Italian American residents of any US city.[73] New Haven is a predominantly Roman Catholic city, as the city's Dominican, Irish, Italian, Mexican, Ecuadorian, and Puerto Rican populations are overwhelmingly Catholic. The city is part of the Archdiocese of Hartford. Jews also make up a considerable portion of the population, as do Black Baptists. There is a growing number of (mostly Puerto Rican) Pentecostals as well. There are churches for all major branches of Christianity within the city, multiple store-front churches, ministries (especially in working-class Latino and Black neighborhoods), a mosque, many synagogues (including two yeshivas), and other places of worship; the level of religious diversity in the city is high.[citation needed] A study of the demographics of the New Haven metro area, based on age, educational attainment, and race and ethnicity, found that they were the closest of any American city to the national average.[74] Law and Government[edit] Political structure[edit] See also: List of mayors of New Haven, Connecticut and Mayoral elections in New Haven, Connecticut Statue of Roman orator Cicero at the New Haven County Courthouse New Haven is governed via the mayor-council system. Connecticut municipalities (like those of neighboring states Massachusetts and Rhode Island) provide nearly all local services (such as fire and rescue, education, snow removal, etc.), as county government has been abolished since 1960.[75] New Haven City Hall New Haven County merely refers to a grouping of towns and a judicial district, not a governmental entity. New Haven is a member of the South Central Connecticut Regional Council of Governments (SCRCOG), a regional agency created to facilitate coordination between area municipal governments and state and federal agencies, in the absence of county government.[76] Justin Elicker is the mayor of New Haven. He was sworn in as the 51st mayor of New Haven on January 1, 2020. The city council, called the Board of Alders, consists of thirty members, each elected from single-member wards.[77] Each of the 30 wards consists of slightly over 4,300 residents; redistricting takes place every ten years.[78] The city is overwhelmingly Democratic. In 2017, of the town's 83,694 voters, 66% were registered as Democrats (-4% since 2015), 4% were registered as Republicans (+1%), and 29% were unaffiliated (+3).[79] The board of alders is dominated by Democrats; a Republican has not served as a New Haven alder since 2011.[80][81] New Haven is served by the New Haven Police Department, which had 443 sworn officers in 2011.[82] The city is also served by the New Haven Fire Department. New Haven lies within Connecticut's 3rd congressional district and has been represented by Rosa DeLauro since 1991. Martin Looney and Gary Holder-Winfield represent New Haven in the Connecticut State Senate, and the city lies within six districts (numbers 92 through 97) of the Connecticut House of Representatives.[83][84] The Greater New Haven area is served by the New Haven Judicial District Court and the New Haven Superior Court, both headquartered at the New Haven County Courthouse.[85] The federal District Court for the District of Connecticut has a New Haven facility, the Richard C. Lee United States Courthouse. Political history[edit] See also: List of Yale University people § Law and politics; and List of people from New Haven, Connecticut § Politicians A portrait of Roger Sherman, signer of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, author of the Connecticut Compromise, and the first mayor of New Haven New Haven is the birthplace of former president George W. Bush,[86] who was born when his father, former president George H. W. Bush, was living in New Haven while a student at Yale. In addition to being the site of the college educations of both Presidents Bush, as Yale students, New Haven was also the temporary home of former presidents William Howard Taft, Gerald Ford, and Bill Clinton, as well as Secretary of State John Kerry. President Clinton met his wife, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while the two were students at Yale Law School. Former vice presidents John C. Calhoun and Dick Cheney also studied in New Haven (although the latter did not graduate from Yale). Before the 2008 election, the last time there was not a person with ties to New Haven and Yale on either major party's ticket was 1968. James Hillhouse, a New Haven native, served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate in 1801. A predominantly Democratic city, New Haven voters overwhelmingly supported Al Gore in the 2000 election, Yale graduate John Kerry in 2004,[87] and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. In the 2008 election, New Haven County was third among all Connecticut counties in campaign contributions, after Fairfield and Hartford counties. (Connecticut, in turn, was ranked 14th among all states in total campaign contributions.)[88][89] New Haven was the subject of Who Governs? Democracy and Power in An American City, a very influential book in political science by preeminent Yale professor Robert A. Dahl, which includes an extensive history of the city and thorough description of its politics in the 1950s. New Haven's theocratic history is also mentioned several times by Alexis de Tocqueville in his classic volume on 19th-century American political life, Democracy in America.[90] New Haven was the residence of conservative thinker William F. Buckley, Jr., in 1951, when he wrote his influential God and Man at Yale. William Lee Miller's The Fifteenth Ward and the Great Society (1966) similarly explores the relationship between local politics in New Haven and national political movements, focusing on Lyndon Johnson's Great Society and urban renewal.[91] George Williamson Crawford, a Yale Law School graduate, served as the city's first black corporation counsel from 1954 to 1962, under Mayor Richard C. Lee.[92] In 1970, the New Haven Black Panther trials took place, the largest and longest trials in Connecticut history. Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale and ten other party members were tried for murdering an alleged informant. Beginning on May Day, the city became a center of protest for 12,000 Panther supporters, college students, and New Left activists (including Jean Genet, Benjamin Spock, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and John Froines), who amassed on the New Haven Green, across the street from where the trials were being held. Violent confrontations between the demonstrators and the New Haven Police occurred, and several bombs were set off in the area by radicals. The event became a rallying point for the New Left and critics of the Nixon Administration.[93][94] During the summer of 2007, New Haven was the center of protests by anti-immigration groups who opposed the city's program of offering municipal ID cards, known as the Elm City Resident Card, to illegal immigrants.[95][96][97] In 2008, the country of Ecuador opened a consulate in New Haven to serve the large Ecuadorean immigrant population in the area. It is the first foreign mission to open in New Haven since Italy opened a consulate (now closed) in the city in 1910.[98][99] In April 2009, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear a suit over reverse discrimination brought by 20 white and Hispanic firefighters against the city. The suit involved the 2003 promotion test for the New Haven Fire Department. After the tests were scored, no blacks scored high enough to qualify for consideration for promotion, so the city announced that no one would be promoted. On 29 June 2009, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the firefighters, agreeing that they were improperly denied promotion because of their race.[100] The case, Ricci v. DeStefano, became highly publicized and brought national attention to New Haven politics due to the involvement of then-Supreme Court nominee (and Yale Law School graduate) Sonia Sotomayor in a lower court decision.[101] Garry Trudeau, creator of the political Doonesbury comic strip, attended Yale University. There he met fellow student and later Green Party candidate for Congress Charles Pillsbury, a long-time New Haven resident for whom Trudeau's comic strip is named. During his college years, Pillsbury was known by the nickname ""The Doones"". A theory of international law, which argues for a sociological normative approach in regards to jurisprudence, is named the New Haven Approach, after the city. Connecticut US senator Richard Blumenthal is a Yale graduate, as is former Connecticut US Senator Joe Lieberman who also was a New Haven resident for many years, before moving back to his hometown of Stamford.[102] Crime[edit] See also: America's Safest and Most Dangerous Cities Crime increased in the 1990s, with New Haven having one of the ten highest violent crime rates per capita in the United States.[103] In the late 1990s New Haven's crime began to stabilize. The city, adopting a policy of community policing, saw crime rates drop during the 2000s.[104][105] Violent crime levels vary dramatically among New Haven's neighborhoods, with some areas having crime rates in line with the state of Connecticut average, and others having extremely high rates of crime. A 2011 New Haven Health Department report identifies these issues in greater detail.[106] In 2010, New Haven ranked as the 18th most dangerous city in the United States (albeit below the safety benchmark of 200.00 for the second year in a row).[107] However, according to a completely different analysis conducted by the ""24/7 Wall Street Blog"", in 2011 New Haven had risen to become the fourth most dangerous city in the United States, and was widely cited in the press as such.[108][109] However, an analysis by the Regional Data Cooperative for Greater New Haven, Inc., has shown that due to issues of comparative denominators and other factors, such municipality-based rankings can be considered inaccurate.[110] For example, two cities of identical population can cover widely differing land areas, making such analyses irrelevant. The research organization called for comparisons based on neighborhoods, blocks, or standard methodologies (similar to those used by Brookings, DiversityData, and other established institutions), not based on municipalities. Education[edit] Colleges and universities[edit] New Haven is a notable center for higher education. Yale University, at the heart of downtown, is one of the city's best known features and its largest employer.[111] New Haven is also home to Southern Connecticut State University, part of the Connecticut State University System, and Albertus Magnus College, a private institution. Gateway Community College has a campus in downtown New Haven, formerly located in the Long Wharf district; Gateway consolidated into one campus downtown into a new state-of-the-art campus (on the site of the old Macy's building) and was open for the Fall 2012 semester.[112][113] There are several institutions immediately outside of New Haven, as well. Quinnipiac University and the Paier College of Art are located just to the north, in the town of Hamden. The University of New Haven is located not in New Haven but in neighboring West Haven. The 1911 student body of the Hopkins School, the fifth-oldest educational institution in the United States Primary and secondary schools[edit] New Haven Public Schools is the school district serving the city. Wilbur Cross High School and Hillhouse High School are New Haven's two largest public secondary schools. Hopkins School, a private school, was founded in 1660 and is the fifth-oldest educational institution in the United States.[114] New Haven is home to a number of other private schools as well as public magnet schools, including Metropolitan Business Academy, High School in the Community, Hill Regional Career High School, Co-op High School, New Haven Academy, Edgewood Magnet School, ACES Educational Center for the Arts, the Foote School and the Sound School, all of which draw students from New Haven and suburban towns. New Haven is also home to two Achievement First charter schools, Amistad Academy and Elm City College Prep, and to Common Ground, an environmental charter school. The city is renowned for its progressive school lunch programs,[115] and participation in statewide bussing efforts toward increased diversity in schools.[116] Culture[edit] Cuisine[edit] Livability.com named New Haven as the Best Foodie City in the country in 2014. There are 56 Zagat-rated restaurants in New Haven, the most in Connecticut and the third most in New England (after Boston and Cambridge).[117] More than 120 restaurants are located within two blocks of the New Haven Green.[118] The city is home to an eclectic mix of ethnic restaurants and small markets specializing in various foreign foods.[119][120] Represented cuisines include Malaysian, Ethiopian, Spanish, Belgian, French, Greek, Latin American, Mexican, Italian, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Indian, Jamaican, Cuban, Peruvian, Syrian/Lebanese, and Turkish.[121] White clam pizza from Pepe's, in the classic New Haven-style New Haven's greatest culinary claim to fame may be its pizza, which has been claimed to be among the best in the country,[122][123][124][125] or even in the world.[126][127] New Haven-style pizza, called ""apizza"", made its debut at the iconic Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana (known as Pepe's) in 1925.[128] Apizza is baked in coal- or wood-fired brick ovens, and is notable for its thin crust. Apizza may be red (with a tomato-based sauce) or white (with a sauce of garlic and olive oil), and pies ordered ""plain"" are made without the otherwise customary mozzarella (originally smoked mozzarella, known as ""scamorza"" in Italian). A white clam pie is a well-known specialty of the restaurants on Wooster Street in the Little Italy section of New Haven, including Pepe's and Sally's Apizza (which opened in 1938). Modern Apizza on State Street, which opened in 1934, is also well-known.[129] Louis' Lunch, where the hamburger was reputedly invented in 1900 A second New Haven gastronomical claim to fame is Louis' Lunch, which is located in a small brick building on Crown Street and has been serving fast food since 1895.[130] Though fiercely debated, the restaurant's founder Louis Lassen is credited by the Library of Congress with inventing the hamburger and steak sandwich.[131][132] Louis' Lunch broils hamburgers, steak sandwiches and hot dogs vertically in original antique 1898 cast iron stoves using gridirons, patented by local resident Luigi Pieragostini in 1939, that hold the meat in place while it cooks.[133] A third New Haven gastronomical claim to fame is Miya's, the first sustainable sushi restaurant in the world. Miya's, founded by Chef Yoshiko Lai in 1982, featured the first sustainable seafood-based sushi menu, the first plant-based sushi menu, and the first invasive species menu in the world. Second generation Miya's chef, Bun Lai, is the 2016 White House Champions of Change for Sustainable Seafood and a James Beard Foundation Award nominee. Chef Bun Lai is credited as the first chef in the world for implementing a sustainability paradigm to the cuisine of sushi.[134][135][136][137][138] Miya's sushi rolls made with invasive Asian shore crab During weekday lunchtime, over 150 lunch carts and food trucks cater to diners around the city.[139] The carts and food trucks cluster at four main points: on Long Wharf Drive, along the city's shoreline with quick access off Interstate 95,[140] by Yale – New Haven Hospital in the center of the Hospital Green (Cedar and York streets), by Yale's Trumbull College (Elm and York streets), and on the intersection of Prospect and Sachem streets by the Yale School of Management.[141] Popular farmers' markets, managed by the local non-profit CitySeed,[142] set up shop weekly in several neighborhoods, including Westville/Edgewood Park, Fair Haven, Upper State Street, Wooster Square, and Downtown/New Haven Green. A large grocery store, the Elm City Market, opened on 360 State Street in New Haven in early fall 2011 and served local produce and groceries to the community. Originally, the market was a member-owned co-op,[143] but debt defaults in August 2014 forced a sale of the business. It is now an employee-owned business; the co-op's previous owners received no equity in the new business.[144] In the past several years, two separate Downtown food tour companies have started offering popular restaurant tours on weekends. Taste of New Haven Tours offers several different weekly restaurant/bar tours and a popular pizza, bike, and pints tour. Culinary Walking Tours offers monthly restaurant tours and sponsors an annual Elm City Iron Chef competition. Theatre and film[edit] The city hosts numerous theatres and production houses, including the Yale Repertory Theatre, the Long Wharf Theatre, and the Shubert Theatre. There is also theatre activity from the Yale School of Drama, which works through the Yale University Theatre and the student-run Yale Cabaret. Southern Connecticut State University hosts the Lyman Center for the Performing Arts. The shuttered Palace Theatre (opposite the Shubert Theatre) was renovated and reopened as the College Street Music Hall in May, 2015. Smaller theatres include the Little Theater on Lincoln Street. Cooperative Arts and Humanities High School also has a theatre on College Street. The theatre is used for student productions, and is the home to weekly services to a local non-denominational church, the City Church New Haven.[145] The Shubert Theatre once premiered many major theatrical productions before their Broadway debuts. Productions that premiered at the Shubert include Oklahoma! (which was also written in New Haven[146]), Carousel, South Pacific, My Fair Lady, The King and I, and The Sound of Music, and the Tennessee Williams play A Streetcar Named Desire. Bow Tie Cinemas owns and operates the Criterion Cinemas, the first new movie theater to open in New Haven in over 30 years and the first luxury movie complex in the city's history. The Criterion has seven screens and opened in November 2004, showing a mix of upscale first run commercial and independent film.[147] Museums[edit] The historic Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale The Yale Center for British Art, designed by Louis Kahn New Haven has a variety of museums, many of them associated with Yale. The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library features an original copy of the Gutenberg Bible. There is also the Connecticut Children's Museum; the Knights of Columbus museum near that organization's world headquarters; the Peabody Museum of Natural History; the Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments; the Eli Whitney Museum (across the town line in Hamden, Connecticut, on Whitney Avenue); the Yale Center for British Art, which houses the largest collection of British art outside the U.K.,[148] and the Yale University Art Gallery, the western hemisphere's oldest college art museum.[149] New Haven is also home to the New Haven Museum and Historical Society on Whitney Avenue, which has a library of many primary source treasures dating from Colonial times to the present. Artspace on Orange Street is one of several contemporary art galleries around the city, showcasing the work of local, national, and international artists. Others include City Gallery and A. Leaf Gallery in the downtown area. Westville galleries include Kehler Liddell, Jennifer Jane Gallery, and The Hungry Eye. The Erector Square complex in the Fair Haven neighborhood houses, the Parachute Factory gallery along with numerous artist studios, and the complex serves as an active destination during City-Wide Open Studios held yearly in October. New Haven is the home port of a life-size replica of the historical Freedom Schooner Amistad, which is open for tours at Long Wharf pier at certain times during the summer. Also at Long Wharf pier is the Quinnipiack schooner, offering sailing cruises of the harbor area throughout the summer. The Quinnipiack also functions as a floating classroom for hundreds of local students. Music[edit] The New Haven Green is the site of many free music concerts, especially during the summer months. These have included the New Haven Symphony Orchestra, the July Free Concerts on the Green, and the New Haven Jazz Festival in August. The Jazz Festival, which began in 1982, is one of the longest-running free outdoor festivals in the U.S., until it was canceled for 2007. Headliners such as The Breakfast, Dave Brubeck, Ray Charles and Celia Cruz have historically drawn 30,000 to 50,000 fans, filling up the New Haven Green to capacity. The New Haven Jazz Festival was revived in 2008 and has been sponsored since by Jazz Haven.[150] New Haven is home to the concert venue Toad's Place, and a new venue, College Street Music Hall. The city has retained an alternative art and music underground that has helped to influence post-punk era music movements such as indie, college rock and underground hip-hop. Other local venues include Cafe Nine, BAR, Pacific Standard Tavern, Stella Blues, Three Sheets, Firehouse 12, and Rudy's. The Yale School of Music contributes to the city's music scene by offering hundreds of free concerts throughout the year at venues in and around the Yale campus. Large performances are held in the 2,700-seat Woolsey Hall auditorium, which contains the world's largest symphonic organs, while chamber music and recitals are performed in Sprague Hall. Hardcore band Hatebreed are from Wallingford, but got their start in New Haven under the name Jasta 14. The band Miracle Legion formed in New Haven in 1983. Folk musicians from New Haven include Loren Mazzacane Connors and Kath Bloom. The Hillhouse Opera Company is a U.S. non-profit[151] opera company based in New Haven that performs in the New Haven area. Founded in 2008 by Victoria Leigh Gardner, Nicole Rodriguez and Jim Coatsworth Hillhouse Opera Company has performed operas as well as opera scenes programs, master classes and concert series.[152][153][154] In 2011, the Company professionally staged the works created through the Riverview Opera Project. The Riverview Opera Project created workshops for children and adolescents at Riverview Hospital, Connecticut's only state-funded psychiatric hospital for youth, and helped them to successfully create, produce, and perform four original operas.[155] Festivals[edit] In addition to the Jazz Festival (described above), New Haven serves as the home city of the annual International Festival of Arts and Ideas. New Haven's Saint Patrick's Day parade, which began in 1842, is New England's oldest and draws the largest crowds of any one-day spectator event in Connecticut.[156] The St. Andrew the Apostle Italian Festival has taken place in the historic Wooster Square neighborhood every year since 1900. Other parishes in the city celebrate the Feast of Saint Anthony of Padua and a carnival in honor of St. Bernadette Soubirous.[157] New Haven celebrates Powder House Day every April on the New Haven Green to commemorate the city's entrance into the Revolutionary War. The annual Wooster Square Cherry Blossom Festival[158] commemorates the 1973 planting of 72 Yoshino Japanese cherry blossom trees by the New Haven Historic Commission in collaboration with the New Haven Parks Department and residents of the neighborhood. The Festival now draws well over 5,000 visitors. The Film Fest New Haven has been held annually since 1995. Nightlife[edit] In the past decade downtown has seen an influx of new restaurants, bars, and nightclubs. Large crowds are drawn to the Crown Street area downtown on weekends where many of the restaurants and bars are located. Crown Street between State and High Streets has dozens of establishments, as do nearby Temple and College Streets. Away from downtown, Upper State Street has a number of restaurants and bars popular with local residents and weekend visitors. Newspapers and media[edit] New Haven is served by the daily New Haven Register, the weekly ""alternative"" New Haven Advocate (which is run by Tribune, the corporation owning the Hartford Courant), the online daily New Haven Independent,[159] and the monthly Grand News Community Newspaper. Downtown New Haven is covered by an in-depth civic news forum, Design New Haven. The Register also backs PLAY magazine, a weekly entertainment publication. The city is also served by several student-run papers, including the Yale Daily News, the weekly Yale Herald and a humor tabloid, Rumpus Magazine. WTNH Channel 8, the ABC affiliate for Connecticut, WCTX Channel 59, the MyNetworkTV affiliate for the state, Connecticut Public Television station WEDY channel 65, a PBS affiliate, and WTXX Channel 34, the IntrigueTV affiliate, broadcast from New Haven. All New York City news and sports team stations broadcast to New Haven County. Sports and athletics[edit] Yale Bowl during ""The Game"" in 2001 Main article: Sports in New Haven, Connecticut New Haven has a history of professional sports franchises dating back to the 19th century[160] and has been the home to professional baseball, basketball, football, hockey, and soccer teams—including the New York Giants of the National Football League from 1973 to 1974, who played at the Yale Bowl. Throughout the second half of the 20th century, New Haven consistently had minor league hockey and baseball teams, which played at the New Haven Arena (built in 1926, demolished in 1972), New Haven Coliseum (1972–2002), and Yale Field (1928–present). When John DeStefano, Jr., became mayor of New Haven in 1995, he outlined a plan to transform the city into a major cultural and arts center in the Northeast, which involved investments in programs and projects other than sports franchises. As nearby Bridgeport built new sports facilities, the brutalist New Haven Coliseum rapidly deteriorated. Believing the upkeep on the venue to be a drain of tax dollars, the DeStefano administration closed the Coliseum in 2002; it was demolished in 2007. New Haven's last professional sports team, the New Haven County Cutters, left in 2009. The DeStefano administration did, however, see the construction of the New Haven Athletic Center in 1998, a 94,000-square-foot (8,700 m2) indoor athletic facility with a seating capacity of over 3,000. The NHAC, built adjacent to Hillhouse High School, is used for New Haven public schools athletics, as well as large-scale area and state sporting events; it is the largest high school indoor sports complex in the state.[161][162][163] New Haven was the host of the 1995 Special Olympics World Summer Games; then-President Bill Clinton spoke at the opening ceremonies.[164] The city is home to the Pilot Pen International tennis event, which takes place every August at the Connecticut Tennis Center, one of the largest tennis venues in the world.[165] New Haven biannually hosts ""The Game"" between Yale and Harvard, the country's second-oldest college football rivalry. Numerous road races take place in New Haven, including the USA 20K Championship during the New Haven Road Race.[166] Greater New Haven is home to a number of college sports teams. The Yale Bulldogs play Division I college sports, as do the Quinnipiac Bobcats in neighboring Hamden. Division II athletics are played by Southern Connecticut State University and the University of New Haven (actually located in neighboring West Haven), while Albertus Magnus College athletes perform at the Division III level. New Haven is home to many New York Yankees, New York Mets, & Boston Red Sox fans due to the proximity of New York City & Boston.[167] Walter Camp, deemed the ""father of American football,"" was a New Havener. The New Haven Warriors rugby league team play in the AMNRL. They have a large number of Pacific Islanders playing for them.[168] Their field is located at the West Haven High School's Ken Strong Stadium.[169] They won the 2008 AMNRL Grand Final.[170] Structures[edit] Architecture[edit] Collegiate Gothic architecture is popular in New Haven New Haven has many architectural landmarks dating from every important time period and architectural style in American history. The city has been home to a number of architects and architectural firms that have left their mark on the city including Ithiel Town and Henry Austin in the 19th century and Cesar Pelli, Warren Platner, Kevin Roche, Herbert Newman and Barry Svigals in the 20th. The Yale School of Architecture has fostered this important component of the city's economy. Cass Gilbert, of the Beaux-Arts school, designed New Haven's Union Station and the New Haven Free Public Library and was also commissioned for a City Beautiful plan in 1919. Frank Lloyd Wright, Marcel Breuer, Alexander Jackson Davis, Philip C. Johnson, Gordon Bunshaft, Louis Kahn, James Gamble Rogers, Frank Gehry, Charles Willard Moore, Stefan Behnisch, James Polshek, Paul Rudolph, Eero Saarinen and Robert Venturi all have designed buildings in New Haven. Yale's 1950s-era Ingalls Rink, designed by Eero Saarinen, was included on the America's Favorite Architecture list created in 2007.[171] Several residential homes in New Haven were designed by Alice Washburn, a noted female architect whose Colonial Revival style set a standard for homes in the region.[172] Many of the city's neighborhoods are well-preserved as walkable ""museums"" of 19th- and 20th-century American architecture, particularly by the New Haven Green, Hillhouse Avenue and other residential sections close to Downtown New Haven. Overall, a large proportion of the city's land area is National (NRHP) historic districts. One of the best sources on local architecture is New Haven: Architecture and Urban Design, by Elizabeth Mills Brown.[173] See also: List of tallest buildings in New Haven The five tallest buildings in New Haven are:[174] Connecticut Financial Center 383 ft (117 m) 26 floors 360 State Street 338 ft (103 m) 32 floors Knights of Columbus Building 321 ft (98 m) 23 floors Kline Biology Tower 250 ft (76 m) 16 floors Crown Towers 233 ft (71 m) 22 floors Historic points of interest[edit] The Graves-Dwight mansion on Hillhouse Avenue See also: National Register of Historic Places listings in New Haven, Connecticut Many historical sites exist throughout the city, including 59 properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Of these, nine are among the 60 U.S. National Historic Landmarks in Connecticut. The New Haven Green, one of the National Historic Landmarks, was formed in 1638, and is home to three 19th-century churches. Below the First Church of Christ in New Haven (referred to as the Center Church on the Green) lies a 17th-century crypt, which is open to visitors.[175] Some of the more famous burials include the first wife of Benedict Arnold and the aunt and grandmother of President Rutherford B. Hayes; Hayes visited the crypt while President in 1880.[176] The Old Campus of Yale University is located next to the Green, and includes Connecticut Hall, Yale's oldest building and a National Historic Landmark. The Hillhouse Avenue area, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is also a part of Yale's campus, has been called a walkable museum, due to its 19th-century mansions and street scape; Charles Dickens is said to have called Hillhouse Avenue ""the most beautiful street in America"" when visiting the city in 1868.[177] The restored Black Rock Fort In 1660, Edward Whalley (a cousin and friend of Oliver Cromwell) and William Goffe, two English Civil War generals who signed the death warrant of King Charles I, hid in a rock formation in New Haven after having fled England upon the restoration of Charles II to the English throne.[178] They were later joined by a third regicide, John Dixwell. The rock formation, which is now a part of West Rock Park, is known as Judges' Cave, and the path leading to the cave is called the Regicides Trail. After the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, the Connecticut colonial government ordered the construction of Black Rock Fort (to be built on top of an older 17th-century fort) to protect the port of New Haven. In 1779, during the Battle of New Haven, British soldiers captured Black Rock Fort and burned the barracks to the ground. The fort was reconstructed in 1807 by the federal government (on orders from the Thomas Jefferson administration), and rechristened Fort Nathan Hale, after the Revolutionary War hero who had lived in New Haven. The cannons of Fort Nathan Hale were successful in defying British war ships during the War of 1812. In 1863, during the Civil War, a second Fort Hale was built next to the original, complete with bomb-resistant bunkers and a moat, to defend the city should a Southern raid against New Haven be launched. The United States Congress deeded the site to the state in 1921, and all three versions of the fort have been restored. The site is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places and receives thousands of visitors each year.[179][180] Grove Street Cemetery, a National Historic Landmark which lies adjacent to Yale's campus, contains the graves of Roger Sherman, Eli Whitney, Noah Webster, Josiah Willard Gibbs, Charles Goodyear and Walter Camp, among other notable burials.[181] The cemetery is noted for its Egyptian Revival gateway, and is the oldest planned burial ground in the United States.[182] The Union League Club of New Haven building, located on Chapel Street, is notable for not only being a historic Beaux-Arts building, but also is built on the site where Roger Sherman's home once stood; George Washington is known to have stayed at the Sherman residence while President in 1789 (one of three times Washington visited New Haven throughout his lifetime).[183][184] Two sites pay homage to the time President and Chief Justice William Howard Taft lived in the city, as both a student and later Professor at Yale: a plaque on Prospect Street marks the site where Taft's home formerly stood,[185] and downtown's Taft Apartment Building (formerly the Taft Hotel) bears the name of the former president who resided in the building for eight years before becoming Chief Justice of the United States.[146] Lighthouse Point Park, a public beach run by the city, was a popular tourist destination during the Roaring Twenties, attracting luminaries of the period such as Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb.[186] The park remains popular among New Haveners, and is home to the Five Mile Point Lighthouse, constructed in 1847, and the Lighthouse Point Carousel, constructed in 1916.[187][188] Five Mile Point Light was decommissioned in 1877 following the construction of Southwest Ledge Light at the entrance of the harbor, which remains in service to this day. Both of the lighthouses and the carousel are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Other historic sites in the city include the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, which stands at the summit of East Rock, the Marsh Botanical Garden, Wooster Square, Dwight Street, Louis' Lunch, and the Farmington Canal, all of which date back to the 19th century. Other historic parks besides the Green include Edgerton Park, Edgewood Park, and East Rock Park, each of which is included on the National Register of Historic Places. Transportation[edit] Rail[edit] Union Station in 2016 New Haven is connected to New York City and points along the Northeast corridor by commuter rail, regional rail and inter-city rail. Service is provided by: Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line (commuter rail) to points west, such as Bridgeport, Stamford, Greenwich, and New York City Shore Line East (commuter rail) to points east, such as Old Saybrook and New London, with limited rush-hour service west to Stamford Hartford Line (commuter rail) to points north, such as Meriden, Hartford, Windsor, and Springfield, MA Amtrak (regional and intercity rail) The city's main railroad station is the historic Beaux-Arts Union Station, which serves Metro-North, Hartford Line, and Shore Line East commuter trains. Union Station is also served by four Amtrak lines: the Northeast Regional and the high-speed Acela Express provide service to New York, Washington, D.C. and Boston, and rank as the first and second busiest routes in the country; the New Haven–Springfield Line provides service to Hartford and Springfield, Massachusetts; and the Vermonter provides service to both Washington, D.C., and Vermont, 15 miles (24 km) from the Canada–US border. Amtrak also codeshares with United Airlines for travel to any airport serviced by United Airlines, via Newark Liberty International Airport (IATA: EWR) originating from or terminating at Union Station (IATA: ZVE). An additional station, State Street Station, was opened in 2002, providing passengers easier access to downtown New Haven. State Street Station is currently serviced by Shore Line East and Hartford Line trains, plus some peak-hour Metro-North trips. Bus[edit] A New Haven Division bus in Downtown New Haven, near the Green The New Haven Division of Connecticut Transit (CT Transit), the state's bus system, is the second largest division in the state with 24 routes. All routes originate from the New Haven Green, making it the central transfer hub of the city. Service is provided to 19 different municipalities throughout Greater New Haven. Bus routes were formerly identified by letters, but as of October 8, 2017, all service was renamed using 200-series numbers, in accordance with a renumbering of CTtransit's statewide services.[189] CT Transit's Union Station Shuttle provides free service from Union Station to the New Haven Green and several New Haven parking garages. Peter Pan and Greyhound bus lines have scheduled stops at Union Station, and connections downtown can be made via the Union Station Shuttle. A private company operates the New Haven/Hartford Express which provides commuter bus service to Hartford. The Yale University Shuttle provides free transportation around New Haven for Yale students, faculty, and staff. The New Haven Division buses follow routes that had originally been covered by trolley service. Horse-drawn streetcars began operating in New Haven in the 1860s, and by the mid-1890s all the lines had become electric. In the 1920s and 1930s, some of the trolley lines began to be replaced by bus lines, with the last trolley route converted to bus in 1948. The City of New Haven is in the very early stages of considering the restoration of streetcar (light-rail) service, which has been absent since the postwar period.[190][191][192][193] Bicycle[edit] Bikeshare[edit] On February 21, 2018, New Haven officially launched its Bike New Haven bikeshare program.[194] based on dockless technology powered by Noa Technologies[195] At time of launch, the program features 10 docking stations and 100 bikes, spread throughout the urban core; there are plans to reach 30 bike stations and 300 bikes by the end of April 2018.[194] The launch of the New Haven bikeshare program coincided with the launch of Yale University's own bikeshare program, which uses the same technology powered by Noa.[196] Bike lanes[edit] In 2004, the first bike lane in the city was added to Orange Street, connecting East Rock Park and the East Rock neighborhood to downtown. Since then, bike lanes have also been added to sections of Howard Ave, Elm St, Dixwell Avenue, Water Street, Clinton Avenue and State Street. The city has created recommended bike routes for getting around New Haven, including use of the Canal Trail and the Orange Street lane.[197][198] As of the end of 2012, bicycle lanes have also been added in both directions on Dixwell Avenue along most of the street from downtown to the Hamden town line, as well as along Howard Avenue from Yale New Haven Hospital to City Point. The city has plans to create two additional bike lanes connecting Union Station with downtown, and the Westville neighborhood with downtown. The city has added dozens of covered bike parking spots at Union Station, in order to facilitate more bike commuting to the station.[199] Farmington Canal Greenway[edit] The Farmington Canal Trail is a rail trail that will eventually run continuously from downtown New Haven to Northampton, Massachusetts. The scenic trail follows the path of the historic New Haven and Northampton Company and the Farmington Canal. Currently, there is a continuous 14-mile (23 km) stretch of the trail from downtown, through Hamden and into Cheshire, making bicycle commuting between New Haven and those suburbs possible. The trail is part of the East Coast Greenway, a proposed 3,000-mile (4,800 km) bike path that would link every major city on the East Coast from Florida to Maine. Roads[edit] The Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge, locally known as the Q Bridge, carries ten lanes over the Quinnipiac River along the Connecticut Turnpike. New Haven lies at the intersection of Interstate 95 on the coast—which provides access southwards and/or westwards to the western coast of Connecticut and to New York City, and eastwards to the eastern Connecticut shoreline, Rhode Island, and eastern Massachusetts—and Interstate 91, which leads northward to the interior of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont and the Canada–US border. I-95 is infamous for traffic jams increasing with proximity to New York City; on the east side of New Haven it passes over the Quinnipiac River via the Pearl Harbor Memorial, or ""Q Bridge"", which often presents a major bottleneck to traffic. I-91, however, is relatively less congested, except at the intersection with I-95 during peak travel times. The Oak Street Connector (Connecticut Route 34) intersects I-91 at exit 1, just south of the I-95/I-91 interchange, and runs northwest for a few blocks as an expressway spur into downtown before emptying onto surface roads. The Wilbur Cross Parkway (Connecticut Route 15) runs parallel to I-95 west of New Haven, turning northwards as it nears the city and then running northwards parallel to I-91 through the outer rim of New Haven and Hamden, offering an alternative to the I-95/I-91 journey (restricted to non-commercial vehicles). Route 15 in New Haven is the site of the only highway tunnel in the state (officially designated as Heroes Tunnel), running through West Rock, home to West Rock Park and the Three Judges Cave. The Wilbur Cross Parkway passes through West Rock via Heroes Tunnel, the only highway tunnel in Connecticut. The city also has several major surface arteries. U.S. Route 1 (Columbus Avenue, Union Avenue, Water Street, Forbes Avenue) runs in an east–west direction south of downtown serving Union Station and leading out of the city to Milford, West Haven, East Haven and Branford. The main road from downtown heading northwest is Whalley Avenue (partly signed as Route 10 and Route 63) leading to Westville and Woodbridge. Heading north towards Hamden, there are two major thoroughfares, Dixwell Avenue and Whitney Avenue. To the northeast are Middletown Avenue (Route 17), which leads to the Montowese section of North Haven, and Foxon Boulevard (Route 80), which leads to the Foxon section of East Haven and to the town of North Branford. To the west is Route 34, which leads to the city of Derby. Other major intracity arteries are Ella Grasso Boulevard (Route 10) west of downtown, and College Street, Temple Street, Church Street, Elm Street, and Grove Street in the downtown area. Traffic safety is a major concern for drivers, pedestrians and cyclists in New Haven.[200] In addition to many traffic-related fatalities in the city each year, since 2005, over a dozen Yale students, staff and faculty have been killed or injured in traffic collisions on or near the campus.[201] Airport[edit] Tweed New Haven Regional Airport is located within the city limits 3 miles (5 km) east of the business district. Bus service between Downtown New Haven and Tweed is available via the CT Transit New Haven Division. Taxi service and rental cars are available at the airport. Travel time from Tweed to downtown takes approximately 15 minutes by car. Other nearby airports include: Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. Sikorsky Memorial Airport in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Seaport[edit] Port of New Haven New Haven Harbor is home to the Port of New Haven, a deep-water seaport with three berths capable of hosting vessels and barges as well as the facilities required to handle break bulk cargo. The port has the capacity to load 200 trucks a day from the ground or via loading docks. Rail transportation access is available, with a private switch engine for yard movements and private siding for loading and unloading. Approximately 400,000 square feet (40,000 m2) of inside storage and 50 acres (200,000 m2) of outside storage are available at the site. Five shore cranes with a 250-ton capacity and 26 forklifts, each with a 26-ton capacity, are also available.[60] On June 17, 2013, the city commissioned the Nathan Hale, a 36 foot (11 m) port security vessel capable of serving search and rescue, firefighting, and constabulary roles.[202][203] Infrastructure[edit] Yale's Sterling Memorial Library Hospitals and medicine[edit] The New Haven area supports several medical facilities that are considered some of the best hospitals in the country. There are two major medical centers downtown: Yale – New Haven Hospital has four pavilions, including the Yale – New Haven Children's Hospital[204] and the Smilow Cancer Hospital;[205] the Hospital of Saint Raphael is several blocks north, and touts its excellent cardiac emergency care program. Smaller downtown health facilities are the Temple Medical Center located downtown on Temple Street, Connecticut Mental Health Center/[206] across Park Street from Y-NHH, and the Hill Health Center,[207] which serves the working-class Hill neighborhood. A large Veterans Affairs hospital is located in neighboring West Haven. To the west in Milford is Milford Hospital, and to the north in Meriden is the MidState Medical Center.[208] Yale and New Haven are working to build a medical and biotechnology research hub in the city and Greater New Haven region, and are succeeding to some extent.[citation needed] The city, state and Yale together run Science Park,[209] a large site three blocks northwest of Yale's Science Hill campus.[210] This multi-block site, approximately bordered by Mansfield Street, Division Street, and Shelton Avenue, is the former home of Winchester's and Olin Corporation's 45 large-scale factory buildings. Currently, sections of the site are large-scale parking lots or abandoned structures, but there is also a large remodeled and functioning area of buildings (leased primarily by a private developer) with numerous Yale employees, financial service and biotech companies. A second biotechnology district is being planned for the median strip on Frontage Road, on land cleared for the never-built Route 34 extension.[210] As of late 2009, a Pfizer drug-testing clinic, a medical laboratory building serving Yale – New Haven Hospital, and a mixed-use structure containing parking, housing and office space, have been constructed on this corridor.[210] A former SNET telephone building at 300 George Street is being converted into lab space, and has been quite successful so far in attracting biotechnology and medical firms.[210] Power supply facilities[edit] Electricity for New Haven is generated by a 448 MW oil and gas-fired generating station located on the shore at New Haven Harbor.[211] Pennsylvania Power and Light (PPL) Inc. operates a 220 MW peaking natural gas turbine plant in nearby Wallingford. Near New Haven there is the static inverter plant of the HVDC Cross Sound Cable. There are three PureCell Model 400 fuel cells placed in the city of New Haven—one at the New Haven Public Schools and newly constructed Roberto Clemente School,[212] one at the mixed-use 360 State Street building,[213] and one at City Hall.[214] According to Giovanni Zinn of the city's Office of Sustainability, each fuel cell may save the city up to $1 million in energy costs over a decade.[215] The fuel cells were provided by ClearEdge Power,[216] formerly UTC Power.[217] Additional fuel cells are located at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History and at the Greater New Haven Water Pollution Control Authority (GNHWPCA).[218] Ikea's New Haven facility also utilizes a 250 kW fuel cell and 940.8 kW solar array.[219] New Haven recently installed solar panels at 11 city schools with a combined power generation capacity of 1.8 MW.[220] Owned and maintained by Greenskies, the panels allow New Haven to purchase electricity at a discounted rate through a power-purchasing agreement. The panels bring New Haven's solar capacity to 2.8 MW and will help New Haven meet its commitment to powering 100% of its municipal operations through clean energy, which it made in Summer 2017[221] and reaffirmed in the 2018 New Haven Climate and Sustainability Framework.[222] In popular culture[edit] This article needs additional citations for verification.

Several downtown streets were closed to traffic and received a ""makeover"" to look like streets of 1957, when the film is set. 500 locals were cast as extras for the film.[225][226] In Everybody's Fine (2009), Robert De Niro has a close encounter in what is supposed to be the Denver train station; the scene was filmed in New Haven's Union Station. Union Station tunnel as seen in Everybody's Fine (2009) New Haven is mentioned in the song Peace Frog by The Doors, referencing a 1967 incident where Morrison was arrested for ""attempting to incite a riot"" in the middle of a concert at the New Haven Arena. Notable people[edit] For a more comprehensive list, see List of people from New Haven, Connecticut. Sister cities[edit] New Haven's sister cities are:[227] Afula, Israel Amalfi, Italy Avignon, France Changsha, China Freetown, Sierra Leone Huế, Vietnam León, Nicaragua, Nicaragua San Francisco Tetlanohcan, Mexico Some of these were selected because of historical connection—Freetown because of the Amistad trial. Others, such as Amalfi and Afula, reflect ethnic groups in New Haven. In 1990, the United Nations named New Haven a ""Peace Messenger City"".

It is Canada's third-largest university,[3] and it has approximately 55,700 students, 7,000 faculty and staff, and over 325,000 alumni worldwide.[3] It has eleven faculties, including the Faculty of Liberal Arts & Professional Studies, Faculty of Science, Lassonde School of Engineering, Schulich School of Business, Osgoode Hall Law School, Glendon College, Faculty of Education, Faculty of Health, Faculty of Environmental Studies, Faculty of Graduate Studies, the School of the Arts, Media, Performance and Design (formerly the Faculty of Fine Arts), and 28 research centres. York University was established in 1959 as a non-denominational institution by the York University Act,[4] which received Royal Assent in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario on 26 March of that year.[5] Its first class was held in September 1960 in Falconer Hall on the University of Toronto campus with a total of 76 students.[6] In the fall of 1961, York moved to its first campus, Glendon College, which was leased from U of T, and began to emphasize liberal arts and part-time adult education.[5] In 1965, the university opened a second campus, the Keele Campus, in North York, within the neighbourhood community now called York University Heights. Several of York's programs have gained notable recognition both nationally and internationally. York houses Canada's oldest film school,[7] which has been ranked one of the best in Canada,[8] with an acceptance rate comparable to that of USC School of Cinematic Arts and Tisch School of the Arts.[9] York's Osgoode Hall Law School was ranked fourth best in Canada, behind U of T, McGill, and UBC.[10] In The Economist's 2011 full-time MBA rankings, York's Schulich School of Business ranked ninth in the world, and first in Canada,[11] and in CNN Expansion's ranking of MBA programs, Schulich ranked 18th in the world, placing first in Canada.[12] York's School of Kinesiology and Health Science ranked fourth in Canada and 24th best in the world in 2018.[13] Over the last twenty years, York has become a centre for labour strife with several faculty and other strikes occurring,[14][15][16][17][2][18] including the longest university strike in Canadian history in 2018.

The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.[5] In the fall of 1961, York moved to its first campus, Glendon College, and began to emphasize liberal arts and part-time adult education.[5] York became independent in 1965, after an initial period of affiliation with the University of Toronto (U of T), under the York University Act, 1965.[19] Its main campus on the northern outskirts of Toronto opened in 1965.[6] Murray Ross, who continues to be honoured today at the university in several ways – including the Murray G. Ross Award – was still vice-president of U of T when he was approached to become York University's new president.[20] At the time, York University was envisaged as a feeder campus to U of T, until Ross's powerful vision led it to become a completely separate institution.[21] In 1965, the university opened a second campus, the Keele Campus, in North York, in the Jane and Finch community.[22] The Glendon campus became a bilingual liberal arts college led by Escott Reid, who envisaged it as a national institution to educate Canada's future leaders, a vision shared by Prime Minister Lester Pearson, who formally opened Glendon College in 1966.[22] The first Canadian undergraduate program in dance opened at York University in 1970.[20] In 1972, Canada Post featured the nascent institution on 8¢ stamps, entitled York University Campus, North York, Ont.[23] The first Canadian PhD program in women's studies opened with five candidates in January 1992.[20] Its bilingual mandate and focus on the liberal arts continue to shape Glendon's special status within York University.[24] The new Keele Campus was regarded as somewhat isolated, in a generally industrialized part of the city. Petrol storage facilities are still across the street. Some of the early architecture was unpopular with many, not only for the brutalist designs, but the vast expanses between buildings, which was not viewed as suitable for the climate. In the last two decades, the campus has been intensified with new buildings, including a dedicated student centre and new fine arts, computer science and business administration buildings, a small shopping mall, and a hockey arena. The Aviva Centre tennis stadium, built in 2004, is a perennial host of the Canada Masters tennis tournament. As Toronto has spread further out, York has found itself in a relatively central location within the built-up Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and in particular, near the Jane and Finch neighbourhood. Its master plan envisages a denser on-campus environment commensurate with that location. Students occupied the university's administration offices in March 1997, protesting escalating tuition hikes.[20] In June 2014, the university announced that a new campus would be constructed in Markham, Ontario.[25] The campus will be built near Highway 407, between Kennedy Road and Warden Avenue in partnership with Seneca College.[26] The new campus would house approximately 4,200 students[27] and is anticipated to accommodate up to 10,000 students in future phases.[28] On May 20, 2015, the provincial government announced it will provide financial contribution to this new project.[29] On October 24, 2018, the provincial government announced it would pull its funding for the campus, along with funding for the planned satellite campuses of Laurier University and Ryerson University.[30][31] After this cancellation of funding for the Markham project, York University and its partners planned to seek alternative funding.[32] In July 2020, the provincial government allowed plans for the university to go through. Academics[edit] Reflecting pool in the Harry W. Arthurs Common York's approximately 2,450 full-time faculty and academic librarians are represented by the York University Faculty Association.[33] Contract faculty, teaching assistants, and graduate assistants are represented by CUPE Local 3903.[34] Admissions[edit] York University has over 120 undergraduate programs with 17 degree types (BA, iBA, BHS, BSc, iBSc, BBA, iBBA, BEng, BES, BDes, BPA, BFA, BCom, BEd, BDEM, BHRM, BScN, BSW) and offers over 170 degree options. They admit to 30 international degrees offering international language study and opportunities to study abroad at more than 100 international universities. Its international students represent over 150 countries around the world.

The 2019 Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities ranked the university 488th in the world, and 19th in Canada,[42] whereas the University Ranking by Academic Performance placed the university 488th in the world, and 19th in Canada.[43] York University has also been featured in rankings that evaluates the employment prospects of its graduates. In QS's 2019 graduate employability ranking, the university ranked 301–500 in the world, and 10–17 in Canada.[44] Faculties[edit] View of Vari Hall from Harry W. Arthurs Common York University's Film Department houses Canada's oldest film school[7] and has been ranked one of the best in Canada,[8] with an acceptance rate comparable to that of USC School of Cinematic Arts and Tisch School of the Arts.[9] York University is home to the oldest and largest environmental studies faculty in Canada.[45] From 1999 to 2018, York University offered the first and largest graphic design program in Ontario York/Sheridan Design (YSDN).[46] It was a four-year University degree delivered jointly by the two leading educational institutions of design in Canada (York University and Sheridan College). The joint program has been discontinued and beginning with the class entering in 2019, four-year design students will enrol in a new Bachelor of Design offered by York University, one which is geared for the future of the profession.[47] The Osgoode Hall Law School moved from a downtown location to the York campus in 1969, following the requirement that every law school affiliate with a university.[48] Osgoode Hall offers a number of joint and combined programs.[49] Research centres and institutes[edit] York researchers at the York University Research Leaders 2014 event.

Bronfman Business Library.[58] Study abroad programs[edit] The university also offers the opportunity for students to earn credits towards their degree while studying abroad through international internships, the ""Discover India"" program operated between York and FLAME University, and student exchange programs.[59] The university has student exchange agreements with over 120 institutions in 40 countries.[60] Campuses[edit] Keele Campus[edit] An outdoor art exhibit outside of Scott Library, Keele Campus Main article: Keele Campus (York University) The Keele Campus is the main campus of York University and is located in northern Toronto bordering York Region.[61] Most of the university's faculties reside here, including Liberal Arts, Fine Arts, Business, Law, Environmental Studies, Science and Engineering, Education, and Health. All together, nearly 50,000 students attend classes on the Keele campus. Glendon Campus[edit] Main article: Glendon College Glendon College is a bilingual liberal arts faculty and separate campus of York University.[62] Glendon College is home to the Leslie Frost library.[63] Markham Centre Campus[edit] Main article: Markham Centre Campus In 2018, York University announced a proposal to construct a third campus in the city of Markham. The Government of Ontario supported to partially fund the construction and was announced by premier Doug Ford on July 23, 2020.[64] Other locations[edit] While most of the Schulich School of Business and Osgoode Hall Law School programs are offered at the Keele Campus, both of them maintain satellite facilities in downtown Toronto. Schulich operates the Miles S. Nadal Management Centre at 222 Bay Street (Ernst & Young Tower within the Toronto-Dominion Centre), while Osgoode Hall has a Professional Development Centre at One Dundas West Tower within the Toronto Eaton Centre. Faculty of Environmental Studies The Lillian Meighen Wright Centre is billed as an eco campus next to Las Nubes Forest Reserve in Costa Rica.[65] Student life[edit] Colleges and residences[edit] York has nine undergraduate residential colleges: Founders Residence Vanier Residence Winters Residence Colleges of York University Name(Founded) Motto/Mandate Academic Affiliations Namesake Calumet (1970) ""Technology and the Arts"" Business Administration, Economics, Business and Society, Cognitive Science, Communication Studies, Psychology Norman-French for pipe or pipestem.

Glendon College acts as both a faculty and a college of the university. New College was created in 2009 to accommodate the creation of the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies. Student unions and organizations[edit] York University is home to over 350 student clubs.[66] A number of larger student organizations are supported by student levy fees. These include the local chapters of the social justice group OPIRG, and Regenesis, an environmental organization on campus that runs farmers' markets at the Keele and Glendon campuses, a free store, a community bike centre and an borrowing centre. The Village at York University[edit] The Village at York University[67] off-campus student housing area has become a popular area of accommodation for many upper-year and post-graduate students, and the area has had a large amount of attention particularly for large parties hosted by students, including the annual Battle of the Village kegger held in March. There have also been many reports of the level of noise pollution from late-night parties from students living in the area.[68] Safety has also been a pressing issue.[69] Campus media[edit] Excalibur has been the university's autonomous student newspaper since 1966. In 2008, the YU Free Press was formed as an alternative campus newspaper.[70] YorkU Magazine (est. 2003) is the official magazine of York University. It is published 3 times a year in both a print and digital format. Athletics[edit] York University vs University of Guelph The university is represented in U Sports by the York Lions. Beginning in 1968 York's sporting teams were known as the ""Yeomen"", after the Yeomen Warders, the guardians of the fortress and palace at the Tower of London, otherwise known as Beefeaters. Later, the name ""Yeowomen"" was introduced to encourage women to participate in sports. Popular sentiment ran against this name scheme, however, as many students were fond of noting that a ""Yeowoman"" was fictitious, neither a real word nor having any historical merit. In 2003, after conducting an extensive internal study, the university replaced both names with the ""Lions"", as part of a larger renaming effort, and a new logo, now a white and red lion, was brought into line with the university's new visual scheme. The name change also brought York University in line with the 92% of other Canadian universities which use a single name for both sexes' sports teams. Ironically, students often refer to the female Lions teams as the ""York Lionesses"", even though the name ""Lion"" is intended to apply to both sexes.[71] York offers 29 interuniversity sport teams, 12 sport clubs, 35 intramural sport leagues, special events and 10 pick-up sport activities offered daily. York University has several athletic facilities, some of which are used for major tournaments. These include a football stadium, 4 gymnasia, 5 sport playing fields, 4 softball fields, 9 outdoor tennis courts, 5 squash courts, 3 dance/aerobic studios, 6 ice arenas, a swimming pool, an expanding fitness centre and the new Aviva Centre (home of the Rogers Tennis Cup). In 2014 the York Lions won four banners: the Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) men's national track and field championship, the Ontario University Athletics women's provincial tennis championship and both the OUA and CIS men's soccer titles. York will be hosting the 2015 CIS Men's Soccer Championships at York Stadium November, 2015.[72] In 2015 and 2016 York Lions Women's Tennis team won the Canadian University National Championships.[73] Fight song[edit] Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement and convocation, and athletic games are: ""York Song"", sung to the tune ""Harvard"".[74] Fraternities and sororities[edit] Fraternities and sororities are not recognized by York University.[75] Phi Delta Phi (ΦΔΦ) international legal fraternity, at Osgoode Law School, was given special dispensation when the law school became part of the university, as the fraternity's history with the law school dated back to 1896, and is recognized at York. Campus safety[edit] Many students at York University feel that York University does not do enough to notify students of security incidents on or near campus.[76] Incidents[edit] In June 2008, the university announced it had commissioned an external safety audit after a string of rapes on the university campus. During frosh week 2007, two men entered a campus dormitory and raped two students.[77][78] The victims were 17 and 18 years old at the time.[79] A lawsuit filed claims that ""the entrance door to the college and to the residential room areas of the college were virtually wide open to the public at large"".[80] The perpetrators were Daniel Katsnelson (aka Daniel Kaye or Daniel Katz) and Justin Connort.[81] The next year, in January 2008, another student was sexually assaulted in the stairwell of a campus building.[82] In May 2009, a contract security guard was shot at a York University campus pub, The Underground.[83] In April 2010, a 20-year-old student was sexually assaulted while walking to her apartment, minutes away from the main campus.[84] The incident, described by police as ""particularly severe"" and resulting in ""very serious"" injuries for the victim, was particularly notable as it occurred just a week after Daniel Katsnelson was sentenced for the 2007 rape on the university campus.[85][86] In April 2011, campus security was temporarily increased following the murder of a 23-year-old Chinese overseas student[87][88] in the off-campus housing neighborhood The Village at York University.[89][90][91] On August 26, 2011, York University announced that in response to recommendations in the METRAC Safety Audit, the university will be modifying the service delivery model for York Security Services (YSS) personnel. Members will be trained and issued with handcuffs and batons. Cruisers are to also be equipped with ""silent partners"" for transporting arrested persons.[92] On March 6, 2014, local police and paramedics responded late at night to a shooting at the York University Student Centre. Two women were found at the scene; one had been shot and suffered non-life-threatening injuries and another received minor (non-gun-related) injuries from the suspect. A suspect was apprehended and subsequently charged.[93] On April 10, 2014, two injured students and six others who witnessed the shooting filed a $20.5 million lawsuit against the university, alleging a pattern of negligence.[94] According to the York University community safety reports, security incidents have been on the rise.[95] Property crime has increased from 497 incidents in 2014/2015 to 670 in 2018/2019. Incidents affecting quality of life increased from 962 incidents in 2014/2015 to 1529 in 2018/2019. Crimes against persons increased from 145 in 2014/2015 to 187 in 2018/2019.

Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (December 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) York University has a history of faculty and teaching assistant strikes. In 1997, there was a faculty strike by YUFA[102] that lasted seven weeks. At the time, this was the second longest strike in Canadian University history.[103] Key issues in the strike included retirement, funding, and institutional governance. In 2001, teaching assistants and contract faculty went on strike for 11 weeks, when the university broke its own record.[104] The central issue in the 2001 disruption was the administration's proposed attempts to remove tuition indexation language. 2008 CUPE 3903 Strike Main article: 2008–09 York University strike A strike beginning on November 6, 2008[105] concerned a variety of institutional grievances, including job security for contract professors, elimination of the Non-Academic Student Code of Conduct, creation of whistleblower protection, and fund indexation. On January 20, 2009, CUPE 3903 defeated a forced ratification vote that would have ended the strike. On January 24, Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty announced a rare Sunday recall of the provincial legislature in order to pass back-to-work legislation mandating an immediate end to the strike.[106] On January 29, the York University Labour Disputes Resolution Act was passed in the provincial parliament on a count of 42–8 ending the long 85-day strike and setting a precedent for future university strikes in Ontario. 2015 CUPE 3903 Strike An additional strike by teaching assistants, contract faculty, and graduate assistants took place throughout March 2015. When the strike began, on March 2, the university cancelled nearly all classes because about 2/3 of York courses were taught by the striking contract faculty at the time. On March 10, the contract faculty ratified a new agreement, but the teaching assistants and graduate assistants rejected tentative agreements the bargaining team had reached with the university. The teaching assistants and graduate assistants, continued their strike until the end of the month. Contract faculty did not go back to work in support of the union and classes remained cancelled. The union reached a tentative agreement with the university on March 29, 2015, which was ratified on March 31, 2015, thus putting an immediate end to the 29-day strike.[107] 2018 CUPE 3903 Strike Main article: 2018 York University strike Units 1, 2, and 3 of CUPE Local 3903, the union represented by teaching assistants, contract faculty, and graduate assistants, began striking on Monday, March 5, 2018; several months after their previous collective agreement expired on August 31, 2017. The union's aim was to, in their words, ""secure a fair collective agreement that, among other things, protected quality education and creates a less precarious working environment in Ontario's university sector.""[108] The main issues of the strike revolved around job security and the path to permanent tenured employment for contract faculty. A forced ratification vote was held between April 6–9 and was rejected by an overwhelming majority by all three units. [109] On June 13, a ratification vote was held for Unit 2 members, where the union executives recommended voting against the university's offer.[110] The results of the vote were thrown out due to the fact that there were more ballots cast than signatures of eligible voters.[111] A re-vote was held on June 14 and 15, where Unit 2 ratified the university's offer, with 239 members voting in favour, and 122 opposed. Units 1 and 3 remained on strike until July 25, when the newly formed 42nd Parliament of Ontario led by Premier Doug Ford passed back-to-work legislation via the Urgent Priorities Act, ending the strike after 143 days, making it the longest strike in the post-secondary sector in Canadian history.

"Dance prof’s documentary wins at Cannes Indies Cinema Awards – YFile Home Top Stories Current News Research Bookshelf COVID-19 More about YFile Dance prof's documentary wins at Cannes Indies Cinema Awards July 28, 2021 A film by York University Associate Professor Patrick Alcedo earned the Best Short Documentary award at the Cannes Indies Cinema Awards on July 10. The film, titled They Call Me Dax, tells the story of 15-year-old Dorothy Echipare who struggles to survive as a high-school student and ballet dancer while living alone in a poor urban district in Quezon City, Philippines. “I was elated and surprised when I learned that my new short docu won, as it was an international online competition,” said Alcedo. Chair of the Department of Dance in York’s School of the Arts, Media, Performance & Design (AMPD), Alcedo has directed, written and produced three documentary films in the past year. Two of his other documentary films – A Will To Dream and Am I Being Selfish? – also won, respectively, Best Dance Feature Documentary and Best Inspirational Short Documentary at the Silk Road Film Awards Cannes in May. This same competition singled out They Call Me Dax as Best Dance Short Documentary. The three films put a spotlight on issues of teenage pregnancy, illegal drugs, precarity of labour and inconsistent governmental support in poverty alleviation in the Philippines. They illustrate how dance, when partnered with grit and altruistic teaching, has the potential to navigate and even overcome these social, economic and political issues. Patrick Alcedo “As a dance ethnographer, I am passionate about putting an emphasis on dance’s ability to empower the marginalized. I want to illustrate that dance, as lived in the lives of its practitioners, is an incredible embodied form in understanding the complexities of race, class, ethnicity, gender, religious practices and diasporic/transnational identities,” said Alcedo. “As a Philippine studies scholar and a Filipino, I devote my energies and resources to fleshing out who Filipinos are, whether in the Philippines or in transnational elsewhere – from the point of view of dance, from their own dancing and choreographed bodies.” Along the same vein of marginality as Dorothy’s story, Am I Being Selfish? focuses on the life of her fellow dancer, Jon-Jon Bides. Despite the resulting financial hardship, Jon-Jon insists on supporting his wife and two young sons by teaching ballet to poor children and at-risk youth, like Dorothy. The feature-length documentary, A Will To Dream, anchors its narrative in the life of Luther Perez, a former ballet star in the Philippines and Dorothy and Jon-Jon’s mentor and adoptive father. To give underprivileged children and youth from squatters’ areas in Quezon City and Manila a shot in life, he surrendered his U.S. green card – and with it the promise of a better life abroad – to teach them dance. To date, these films have garnered six official selections from film festivals and award-giving bodies such as the New York Independent Cinema Awards, International Shorts, Lift-Off Online Sessions and the Chicago Indie Film Awards. Alcedo’s latest win at the Cannes Indies has caught the attention of three television stations – DZRH News of the Manila Broadcasting Corporation, Net25 and Omni Filipino News – that together have thus far garnered more than 28,000 views. The three films build on Alcedo’s 20-minute documentary Dancing Manilenyos, which was an official selection at the 2019 Diversity in Cannes Short Film Showcase and received an Award of Merit from the 2019 Global Shorts Competition and an Award of Recognition from the 2018 Hollywood International Independent Documentary Awards. These three recent films would not have been possible if not for the team that Alcedo has put together. Behind these works are cinematographer Alex Felipe, editor and colourist Alec Bell, and transcriber Paulo Alcedo – all York University alumni. Additional cinematography is from John Marie Soberano and archival footage is from both Mark Gary and Denisa Reyes. Peter Alcedo Jr. did the musical scoring. The pre-production, production and post-production of Alcedo’s films have received support from AMPD, the York Centre for Asian Research, the government of Ontario’s Early Researcher Awards program, the Canada Council for the Arts, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council's Research-Creation Grant.

With a recorded population of 2,731,571 in 2016,[13] it is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America. The city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of 9,245,438 people (as of 2016) surrounding the western end of Lake Ontario,[14] while the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) proper had a 2016 population of 6,417,516. Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.[15][16][17] Indigenous peoples have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto area, located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers, deep ravines, and urban forest, for more than 10,000 years.[18] After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase, when the Mississauga surrendered the area to the British Crown,[19] the British established the town of York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada.[20] During the War of 1812, the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by American troops.[21] York was renamed and incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto. It was designated as the capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian Confederation.[22] The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of 630.2 km2 (243.3 sq mi). The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada.[23][24] More than 50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority population group,[25] and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants.[26] While the majority of Torontonians speak English as their primary language, over 160 languages are spoken in the city.[27] Toronto is a prominent centre for music,[28] theatre,[29] motion picture production,[30] and television production,[31] and is home to the headquarters of Canada's major national broadcast networks and media outlets.[32] Its varied cultural institutions,[33] which include numerous museums and galleries, festivals and public events, entertainment districts, national historic sites, and sports activities,[34] attract over 43 million tourists each year.[35][36] Toronto is known for its many skyscrapers and high-rise buildings,[37] in particular the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere, the CN Tower.[38] The city is home to the Toronto Stock Exchange, the headquarters of Canada's five largest banks,[39] and the headquarters of many large Canadian and multinational corporations.[40] Its economy is highly diversified with strengths in technology, design, financial services, life sciences, education, arts, fashion, aerospace, environmental innovation, food services, and tourism.[41][42][43] Contents 1 History 1.1 Before 1800 1.2 19th century 1.3 20th century 1.4 21st century 2 Geography 2.1 Topography 2.2 Climate 3 Cityscape 3.1 Architecture 3.2 Neighbourhoods 3.2.1 Old Toronto 3.2.2 Suburbs 3.2.3 Industrial 3.3 Public spaces 4 Culture 4.1 Media 4.2 Tourism 4.3 Sports 4.3.1 Professional sports 4.3.2 Collegiate sports 4.3.3 Events 5 Economy 6 Demographics 6.1 Population 6.2 Ethnicity 6.3 Religion 6.4 Language 7 Government 8 Crime 9 Education 10 Infrastructure 10.1 Health and medicine 10.2 Transportation 10.2.1 Public transportation 10.2.2 Airports 10.2.3 Intercity transportation 10.2.4 Road system 11 Notable people 12 Sister cities 12.1 Partnership cities 12.2 Friendship cities 13 See also 14 Notes 15 References 15.1 Bibliography 16 Further reading 17 External links History Main article: History of Toronto See also: Amalgamation of Toronto and Name of Toronto Before 1800 When Europeans first arrived at the site of present-day Toronto, the vicinity was inhabited by the Iroquois,[44] who had displaced the Wyandot (Huron) people, occupants of the region for centuries before c. 1500.[45] The name Toronto is likely derived from the Mohawk word tkaronto, meaning ""place where trees stand in the water"".[46][47] This refers to the northern end of what is now Lake Simcoe, where the Huron had planted tree saplings to corral fish. However, the word ""Toronto"", meaning ""plenty"" also appears in a 1632 French lexicon of the Huron language, which is also an Iroquoian language.[48] It also appears on French maps referring to various locations, including Georgian Bay, Lake Simcoe, and several rivers.[49] A portage route from Lake Ontario to Lake Huron running through this point, known as the Toronto Carrying-Place Trail, led to widespread use of the name. The site of Toronto lay at the entrance to one of the oldest routes to the northwest, a route known and used by the Huron, Iroquois, and Ojibwe, and was of strategic importance from the beginning of Ontario's recorded history.[50] In the 1660s, the Iroquois established two villages within what is today Toronto, Ganatsekwyagon on the banks of the Rouge River and Teiaiagon on the banks of the Humber River. By 1701, the Mississauga had displaced the Iroquois, who abandoned the Toronto area at the end of the Beaver Wars, with most returning to their homeland in present-day New York.[51] In the 17th century, the area was a crucial link for travel, with the Humber and Rouge rivers providing a shortcut to the upper Great Lakes. These routes together were known as the Toronto Passage. French traders founded Fort Rouillé in 1750 (the current Exhibition grounds were later developed here), but abandoned it in 1759 during the Seven Years' War.[52] The British defeated the French and their indigenous allies in the war, and the area became part of the British colony of Quebec in 1763. During the American Revolutionary War, an influx of British settlers came here as United Empire Loyalists fled for the British-controlled lands north of Lake Ontario. The Crown granted them land to compensate for their losses in the Thirteen Colonies. The new province of Upper Canada was being created and needed a capital. In 1787, the British Lord Dorchester arranged for the Toronto Purchase with the Mississauga of the New Credit First Nation, thereby securing more than a quarter of a million acres (1000 km2) of land in the Toronto area.[53] Dorchester intended the location to be named Toronto.[49] The first 25 years after the Toronto purchase was quiet, although ""there were occasional independent fur traders"" present in the area, with the usual complaints of debauchery and drunkenness.[50] In 1793, Governor John Graves Simcoe established the town of York on the Toronto Purchase lands, naming it after Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany. Simcoe decided to move the Upper Canada capital from Newark (Niagara-on-the-Lake) to York,[54] believing the new site would be less vulnerable to attack by the United States.[55] The York garrison was built at the entrance of the town's natural harbour, sheltered by a long sand-bar peninsula. The town's settlement formed at the harbour's eastern end behind the peninsula, near the present-day intersection of Parliament Street and Front Street (in the ""Old Town"" area). 19th century In 1813, as part of the War of 1812, the Battle of York ended in the town's capture and plunder by United States forces.[56] John Strachan negotiated the town's surrender. American soldiers destroyed much of the garrison and set fire to the parliament buildings during their five-day occupation. Because of the sacking of York, British troops retaliated later in the war with the burning of Washington, D.C. American forces attacked York in 1813. The Americans subsequently plundered the town, and set fire to the legislative buildings. York was incorporated as the City of Toronto on March 6, 1834, adopting an Indigenous name. Reformist politician William Lyon Mackenzie became the first mayor of Toronto and led the unsuccessful Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837 against the British colonial government. Toronto's population of 9,000 included African-American slaves, some of whom were brought by the Loyalists, including Mohawk leader Joseph Brant, and fewer Black Loyalists, whom the Crown had freed. (Most of the latter were resettled in Nova Scotia.) By 1834, refugee slaves from America's South were also immigrating to Toronto, settling in Canada to gain freedom.[57] Slavery was banned outright in Upper Canada (and throughout the British Empire) in 1834.[58] Torontonians integrated people of colour into their society. In the 1840s, an eating house at Frederick and King Streets, a place of mercantile prosperity in the early city, was operated by a black man named Bloxom.[59] As a major destination for immigrants to Canada, the city grew rapidly through the remainder of the 19th century. The first significant wave of immigrants were Irish, fleeing the Great Irish Famine; most of them were Catholic. By 1851, the Irish-born population had become the largest single ethnic group in the city. The Scottish and English population welcomed smaller numbers of Protestant Irish immigrants, some from what is now Northern Ireland, which gave the Orange Order significant and long-lasting influence over Toronto society. View of Toronto in 1854. Toronto became a major destination for immigrants to Canada in the second half of the 19th century. For brief periods, Toronto was twice the capital of the united Province of Canada: first from 1849 to 1852, following unrest in Montreal, and later 1856–1858. After this date, Quebec was designated as the capital until 1866 (one year before Canadian Confederation). Since then, the capital of Canada has remained Ottawa, Ontario.[60] Toronto became the capital of the province of Ontario after its official creation in 1867. The seat of government of the Ontario Legislature is at Queen's Park. Because of its provincial capital status, the city was also the location of Government House, the residence of the viceregal representative of the Crown in right of Ontario. Long before the Royal Military College of Canada was established in 1876, supporters of the concept proposed military colleges in Canada. Staffed by British Regulars, adult male students underwent a three-month-long military course at the School of Military Instruction in Toronto. Established by Militia General Order in 1864, the school enabled officers of militia or candidates for commission or promotion in the Militia to learn military duties, drill and discipline, to command a company at Battalion Drill, to drill a company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a company, and the duties of a company's officer.[61] The school was retained at Confederation, in 1867. In 1868, Schools of cavalry and artillery instruction were formed in Toronto.[62] The Gooderham and Worts buildings c. 19th century. The distillery became the world's largest whiskey factory by the 1860s. In the 19th century, the city built an extensive sewage system to improve sanitation, and streets were illuminated with gas lighting as a regular service. Long-distance railway lines were constructed, including a route completed in 1854 linking Toronto with the Upper Great Lakes. The Grand Trunk Railway and the Northern Railway of Canada joined in the building of the first Union Station in downtown. The advent of the railway dramatically increased the numbers of immigrants arriving, commerce and industry, as had the Lake Ontario steamers and schooners entering port before. These enabled Toronto to become a major gateway linking the world to the interior of the North American continent. Toronto became the largest alcohol distillation (in particular, spirits) centre in North America. By the 1860s the Gooderham and Worts Distillery operations became the world's largest whiskey factory. A preserved section of this once dominant local industry remains in the Distillery District. The harbour allowed for sure access to grain and sugar imports used in processing. Expanding port and rail facilities brought in northern timber for export and imported Pennsylvania coal. Industry dominated the waterfront for the next 100 years. Horse-drawn streetcars in 1890. The city's streetcar system transitioned to electric-powered streetcars in 1892. Horse-drawn streetcars gave way to electric streetcars in 1891, when the city granted the operation of the transit franchise to the Toronto Railway Company. The public transit system passed into public ownership in 1921 as the Toronto Transportation Commission, later renamed the Toronto Transit Commission. The system now has the third-highest ridership of any city public transportation system in North America.[63] 20th century The Great Toronto Fire of 1904 destroyed a large section of downtown Toronto. The fire destroyed more than 100 buildings.[64] The fire claimed one victim, John Croft, who was an explosive expert clearing the ruins from the fire.[65] It caused CA$10,387,000 in damage (roughly CA$277,600,000 in 2020 terms).[66] The city received new European immigrant groups beginning in the late 19th century into the early 20th century, particularly Germans, French, Italians, and Jews. They were soon followed by Russians, Poles, and other Eastern European nations, in addition to Chinese entering from the West. As the Irish before them, many of these migrants lived in overcrowded shanty-type slums, such as ""the Ward"" which was centred on Bay Street, now the heart of the country's Financial District. By 1934, the Toronto Stock Exchange emerged as the country's largest stock exchange. As new migrants began to prosper, they moved to better housing in other areas, in what is now understood to be succession waves of settlement. Despite its fast-paced growth, by the 1920s, Toronto's population and economic importance in Canada remained second to the much longer established Montreal, Quebec. However, by 1934, the Toronto Stock Exchange had become the largest in the country. In 1954, the City of Toronto and 12 surrounding municipalities were federated into a regional government known as Metropolitan Toronto.[67] The postwar boom had resulted in rapid suburban development and it was believed a coordinated land-use strategy and shared services would provide greater efficiency for the region. The metropolitan government began to manage services that crossed municipal boundaries, including highways, police services, water and public transit. In that year, a half-century after the Great Fire of 1904, disaster struck the city again when Hurricane Hazel brought intense winds and flash flooding. In the Toronto area, 81 people were killed, nearly 1,900 families were left homeless, and the hurricane caused more than CA$25 million in damage.[68] In 1967, the seven smallest municipalities of Metropolitan Toronto were merged with larger neighbours, resulting in a six-municipality configuration that included the former city of Toronto and the surrounding municipalities of East York, Etobicoke, North York, Scarborough, and York.[69] Construction of First Canadian Place, the operational headquarters of the Bank of Montreal, in 1975. During the 1970s, several Canadian financial institutions moved to Toronto. In the decades after World War II, refugees from war-torn Europe and Chinese job-seekers arrived, as well as construction labourers, particularly from Italy and Portugal. Toronto's population grew to more than one million in 1951 when large-scale suburbanization began and doubled to two million by 1971. Following the elimination of racially based immigration policies by the late 1960s, Toronto became a destination for immigrants from all parts of the world. By the 1980s, Toronto had surpassed Montreal as Canada's most populous city and chief economic hub. During this time, in part owing to the political uncertainty raised by the resurgence of the Quebec sovereignty movement, many national and multinational corporations moved their head offices from Montreal to Toronto and Western Canadian cities.[70] On January 1, 1998, Toronto was greatly enlarged, not through traditional annexations, but as an amalgamation of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto and its six lower-tier constituent municipalities: East York, Etobicoke, North York, Scarborough, York, and the original city itself. They were dissolved by an act of the Government of Ontario, and formed into a single-tier City of Toronto (colloquially dubbed the ""megacity"") replacing all six governments. The merger was proposed as a cost-saving measure by the Progressive Conservative provincial government under Mike Harris. The announcement touched off vociferous public objections. In March 1997, a referendum in all six municipalities produced a vote of more than 3∶1 against amalgamation.[71] However, municipal governments in Canada are creatures of the provincial governments, and referendums have little to no legal effect. The Harris government could thus legally ignore the results of the referendum, and did so in April when it tabled the City of Toronto Act. Both opposition parties held a filibuster in the provincial legislature, proposing more than 12,000 amendments that allowed residents on streets of the proposed megacity take part in public hearings on the merger and adding historical designations to the streets.[72] This only delayed the bill's inevitable passage, given the PCO's majority. North York mayor Mel Lastman became the first ""megacity"" mayor, and the 62nd mayor of Toronto, with his electoral victory.[73] Lastman gained national attention after multiple snowstorms, including the January Blizzard of 1999, dumped 118 cm of snow and effectively immobilized the city.[74][75] He called in the Canadian Army to aid snow removal by use of their equipment to augment police and emergency services. The move was ridiculed by some in other parts of the country, fuelled in part by what was perceived as a frivolous use of resources.[76][77] 21st century The city attracted international attention in 2003 when it became the centre of a major Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Public health attempts to prevent the disease from spreading elsewhere temporarily dampened the local economy.[78] From August 14–17, 2003, the city was hit by a massive blackout which affected millions of Torontonians (it also affected most of Southern Ontario and parts of the United States), stranding some hundreds of people in tall buildings, knocking out traffic lights and suspending subway and streetcar service across the city during those aforementioned days.[79] On March 6, 2009, the city celebrated the 175th anniversary of its inception as the City of Toronto in 1834. Toronto hosted the 4th G20 summit during June 26–27, 2010. This included the largest security operation in Canadian history. Following large-scale protests and rioting, law enforcement conducted the largest mass arrest (more than a thousand people) in Canadian history.[80] On July 8, 2013, severe flash flooding hit Toronto after an afternoon of slow-moving, intense thunderstorms. Toronto Hydro estimated 450,000 people were without power after the storm and Toronto Pearson International Airport reported 126 mm (5 in) of rain had fallen over five hours, more than during Hurricane Hazel.[81] Within six months, From December 20 to 22, 2013, Toronto was brought to a near halt by the worst ice storm in the city's history, rivalling the severity of the 1998 Ice Storm (which mostly affected southeastern Ontario, and Quebec). At the height of the storm over 300,000 Toronto Hydro customers had no electricity or heating.[82] Toronto hosted WorldPride in June 2014,[83] and the Pan American Games in 2015.[84] The city continues to grow and attract immigrants. A study by Ryerson University showed that Toronto was the fastest-growing city in North America. The city added 77,435 people between July 2017 and July 2018. The Toronto metropolitan area was the second-fastest-growing metropolitan area in North America, adding 125,298 persons, compared with 131,767 in the Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington metroplex in Texas. The large growth in the Toronto metropolitan area is attributed to international migration to Toronto.[85] The COVID-19 pandemic in Canada first occurred in Toronto and is among the hotspots in the country.[86][87] Geography Main article: Geography of Toronto Toronto covers an area of 630 square kilometres (243 sq mi),[88] with a maximum north–south distance of 21 kilometres (13 mi). It has a maximum east–west distance of 43 km (27 mi) and it has a 46-kilometre (29 mi) long waterfront shoreline, on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario. The Toronto Islands and Port Lands extend out into the lake, allowing for a somewhat sheltered Toronto Harbour south of the downtown core.[89] An Outer Harbour was constructed south east of downtown during the 1950s and 1960s and it is now used for recreation. The city's borders are formed by Lake Ontario to the south, the western boundary of Marie Curtis Park, Etobicoke Creek, Eglinton Avenue and Highway 427 to the west, Steeles Avenue to the north and the Rouge River and Scarborough–Pickering Townline to the east.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (July 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Satellite image of Toronto and surrounding area. Urban areas of the city are interrupted by the Toronto ravine system. The city is mostly flat or gentle hills and the land gently slopes upward away from the lake. The flat land is interrupted by the Toronto ravine system, which is cut by numerous creeks and rivers of the Toronto waterway system, most notably the Humber River in the west end, the Don River east of downtown (these two rivers flanking and defining the Toronto Harbour), and the Rouge River at the city's eastern limits. Most of the ravines and valley lands in Toronto today are parklands, and recreational trails are laid out along the ravines and valleys. The original town was laid out in a grid plan on the flat plain north of the harbour, and this plan was extended outwards as the city grew. The width and depth of several of the ravines and valleys are such that several grid streets, such as Finch Avenue, Leslie Street, Lawrence Avenue, and St. Clair Avenue, terminate on one side of a ravine or valley and continue on the other side. Toronto has many bridges spanning the ravines. Large bridges such as the Prince Edward Viaduct were built to span wide river valleys. Despite its deep ravines, Toronto is not remarkably hilly, but its elevation does increase steadily away from the lake. Elevation differences range from 76.5 metres (251 ft) above sea level at the Lake Ontario shore to 209 m (686 ft) above sea level near the York University grounds in the city's north end at the intersection of Keele Street and Steeles Avenue.[90] There are occasional hilly areas; in particular, midtown Toronto has a number of sharply sloping hills. Lake Ontario remains occasionally visible from the peaks of these ridges as far north as Eglinton Avenue, 7 to 8 kilometres (4.3 to 5.0 mi) inland. The Scarborough Bluffs is an escarpment, formed during the Last Glacial Period as part of the Glacial Lake Iroquois shoreline, which runs along the eastern portion of the Toronto waterfront. The other major geographical feature of Toronto is its escarpments. During the last ice age, the lower part of Toronto was beneath Glacial Lake Iroquois. Today, a series of escarpments mark the lake's former boundary, known as the ""Iroquois Shoreline"". The escarpments are most prominent from Victoria Park Avenue to the mouth of Highland Creek where they form the Scarborough Bluffs. Other observable sections include the area near St. Clair Avenue West between Bathurst Street and the Don River, and north of Davenport Road from Caledonia to Spadina Road; the Casa Loma grounds sit above this escarpment.[91] The geography of the lakeshore is greatly changed since the first settlement of Toronto. Much of the land on the north shore of the harbour is landfill, filled in during the late 19th century. Until then, the lakefront docks (then known as wharves) were set back farther inland than today. Much of the adjacent Port Lands on the east side of the harbour was a wetland filled in early in the 20th century.[92] The shoreline from the harbour west to the Humber River has been extended into the lake. Further west, landfill has been used to create extensions of land such as Humber Bay Park. The Toronto Islands were a natural peninsula until a storm in 1858 severed their connection to the mainland,[93] creating a channel to the harbour. The peninsula was formed by longshore drift taking the sediments deposited along the Scarborough Bluffs shore and transporting them to the Islands area. The other source of sediment for the Port Lands wetland and the peninsula was the deposition of the Don River, which carved a wide valley through the sedimentary land of Toronto and deposited it in the shallow harbour. The harbour and the channel of the Don River have been dredged numerous times for shipping. The lower section of the Don River was straightened and channelled in the 19th century. The former mouth drained into a wetland; today, the Don River drains into the harbour through a concrete waterway, the Keating Channel. To mitigate flooding in the area, as well as to create parkland, a second more natural mouth is being built to the south during the early 2020s, thereby creating Villiers Island.

According to the classification applied by Natural Resources Canada, the city of Toronto is in plant hardiness zone 7a, with some suburbs & nearby towns having lower zone ratings.[97][98] The city experiences four distinct seasons, with considerable variance in length.[99] As a result of the rapid passage of weather systems (such as high- and low-pressure systems), the weather is variable from day to day in all seasons.[99] Owing to urbanization and its proximity to water, Toronto has a fairly low diurnal temperature range. The denser urbanscape makes for warmer nights year round; the average nighttime temperature is about 3.0 °C (5.40 °F) warmer in the city than in rural areas in all months.[100] However, it can be noticeably cooler on many spring and early summer afternoons under the influence of a lake breeze, since Lake Ontario is cool relative to the air during these seasons.[100] These lake breezes mostly occur in summer, bringing relief on hot days.[100] Other low-scale maritime effects on the climate include lake-effect snow, fog, and delaying of spring- and fall-like conditions, known as seasonal lag.[100] Winters in Toronto are typically cold with frequent snowfall. Winters are cold with frequent snow.[101] During the winter months, temperatures are usually below 0 °C (32 °F).[101] Toronto winters sometimes feature cold snaps when maximum temperatures remain below −10 °C (14 °F), often made to feel colder by wind chill. Occasionally, they can drop below −25 °C (−13 °F).[101] Snowstorms, sometimes mixed with ice and rain, can disrupt work and travel schedules, while accumulating snow can fall anytime from November until mid-April. However, mild stretches also occur in most winters, melting accumulated snow. The summer months are characterized by very warm temperatures.[101] Daytime temperatures are usually above 20 °C (68 °F), and often rise above 30 °C (86 °F).[101] However, they can occasionally surpass 35 °C (95 °F) accompanied by high humidity. Spring and autumn are transitional seasons with generally mild or cool temperatures with alternating dry and wet periods.[100] Daytime temperatures average around 10 to 12 °C (50 to 54 °F) during these seasons.[101] Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, but summer is usually the wettest season, the bulk falling during thunderstorms. The average yearly precipitation is about 831 mm (32.7 in), with an average annual snowfall of about 1,220 mm (48 in).[102] Toronto experiences an average of 2,066 sunshine hours or 45% of daylight hours, varying between a low of 28% in December to 60% in July.[102] vteClimate data for Toronto (The Annex), 1981–2010 normals, extremes 1840–present[b] Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high humidex 15.7 12.2 21.7 31.6 39.8 44.5 43.0 42.6 43.8 31.2 26.1 17.7 44.5 Record high °C (°F) 16.1(61.0) 19.1(66.4) 26.7(80.1) 32.2(90.0) 34.4(93.9) 36.7(98.1) 40.6(105.1) 38.9(102.0) 37.8(100.0) 30.8(87.4) 23.9(75.0) 19.9(67.8) 40.6(105.1) Average high °C (°F) −0.7(30.7) 0.4(32.7) 4.7(40.5) 11.5(52.7) 18.4(65.1) 23.8(74.8) 26.6(79.9) 25.5(77.9) 21.0(69.8) 14.0(57.2) 7.5(45.5) 2.1(35.8) 12.9(55.2) Daily mean °C (°F) −3.7(25.3) −2.6(27.3) 1.4(34.5) 7.9(46.2) 14.1(57.4) 19.4(66.9) 22.3(72.1) 21.5(70.7) 17.2(63.0) 10.7(51.3) 4.9(40.8) −0.5(31.1) 9.4(48.9) Average low °C (°F) −6.7(19.9) −5.6(21.9) −1.9(28.6) 4.1(39.4) 9.9(49.8) 14.9(58.8) 18.0(64.4) 17.4(63.3) 13.4(56.1) 7.4(45.3) 2.3(36.1) −3.1(26.4) 5.9(42.6) Record low °C (°F) −32.8(−27.0) −31.7(−25.1) −26.7(−16.1) −15.0(5.0) −3.9(25.0) −2.2(28.0) 3.9(39.0) 4.4(39.9) −2.2(28.0) −8.9(16.0) −20.6(−5.1) −30.0(−22.0) −32.8(−27.0) Record low wind chill −37 −34 −26 −17 −8 0 0 0 0 −8 −17 −34 −37 Average precipitation mm (inches) 61.5(2.42) 55.4(2.18) 53.7(2.11) 68.0(2.68) 82.0(3.23) 70.9(2.79) 63.9(2.52) 81.1(3.19) 84.7(3.33) 64.4(2.54) 84.1(3.31) 61.5(2.42) 831.1(32.72) Average rainfall mm (inches) 29.1(1.15) 29.7(1.17) 33.6(1.32) 61.1(2.41) 82.0(3.23) 70.9(2.79) 63.9(2.52) 81.1(3.19) 84.7(3.33) 64.3(2.53) 75.4(2.97) 38.2(1.50) 714.0(28.11) Average snowfall cm (inches) 37.2(14.6) 27.0(10.6) 19.8(7.8) 5.0(2.0) 0.0(0.0) 0.0(0.0) 0.0(0.0) 0.0(0.0) 0.0(0.0) 0.1(0.0) 8.3(3.3) 24.1(9.5) 121.5(47.8) Average precipitation days (≥ 0.2 mm) 15.4 11.6 12.6 12.6 12.7 11.0 10.4 10.2 11.1 11.7 13.0 13.2 145.5 Average rainy days (≥ 0.2 mm) 5.4 4.8 7.9 11.2 12.7 11.0 10.4 10.2 11.1 11.7 10.9 7.0 114.1 Average snowy days (≥ 0.2 cm) 12.0 8.7 6.5 2.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.08 3.1 8.4 40.9 Mean monthly sunshine hours 85.9 111.3 161.0 180.0 227.7 259.6 279.6 245.6 194.4 154.3 88.9 78.1 2,066.3 Percent possible sunshine 29.7 37.7 43.6 44.8 50.0 56.3 59.8 56.7 51.7 45.1 30.5 28.0 44.5 Average ultraviolet index 1 2 3 5 7 8 8 7 5 3 2 1 4 Source 1: Environment Canada [102][107][108] Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV)[109] Cityscape Toronto skyline at dusk, from Toronto Harbour looking north, in 2018 Architecture Main article: Architecture of Toronto See also: List of oldest buildings and structures in Toronto and List of tallest buildings in Toronto The Royal Ontario Museum was originally designed in a Romanesque Revival style, although other styles have since been added to the building. Architecture in Toronto has been called a ""mix of periods and styles"". Toronto's buildings vary in design and age with many structures dating back to the early 19th century, while other prominent buildings were just newly built in the first decade of the 21st century.[110] Lawrence Richards, a member of the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Toronto, has said, ""Toronto is a new, brash, rag-tag place—a big mix of periods and styles.""[111] Bay-and-gable houses, mainly found in Old Toronto, are a distinct architectural feature of the city. Defining the Toronto skyline is the CN Tower, a telecommunications and tourism hub. Completed in 1976 at a height of 553.33 metres (1,815 ft 5 in), it was the world's tallest[112] freestanding structure until 2007 when it was surpassed by Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[113] Toronto is a city of high-rises, and had 1,875 buildings over 30 metres (98 ft) as of 2011.[114] Through the 1960s and 1970s, significant pieces of Toronto's architectural heritage were demolished to make way for redevelopment or parking. In contrast, since 2000, Toronto has experienced a period of condo construction boom and architectural revival, with several buildings by world-renowned architects having opened. Daniel Libeskind's Royal Ontario Museum addition, Frank Gehry's remake of the Art Gallery of Ontario, and Will Alsop's distinctive OCAD University expansion are among the city's new showpieces.[115] The mid-1800s Distillery District, on the eastern edge of downtown, has been redeveloped into a pedestrian-oriented arts, culture and entertainment neighbourhood.[116] Neighbourhoods Main articles: History of neighbourhoods in Toronto and List of neighbourhoods in Toronto Map of Toronto with major traffic routes. Also shown are the boundaries of six former municipalities, which form the current City of Toronto. Toronto encompasses an area formerly administered by several separate municipalities that were amalgamated over the years. Each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians. Former municipalities include East York, Etobicoke, Forest Hill, Mimico, North York, Parkdale, Scarborough, Swansea, Weston and York. Throughout the city there exists hundreds of small neighbourhoods and some larger neighbourhoods covering a few square kilometres.[citation needed] The many residential communities of Toronto express a character distinct from the skyscrapers in the commercial core. Victorian and Edwardian-era residential buildings can be found in enclaves such as Rosedale, Cabbagetown, The Annex, and Yorkville.[117] The Wychwood Park neighbourhood, historically significant for the architecture of its homes, and for being one of Toronto's earliest planned communities, was designated as an Ontario Heritage Conservation district in 1985.[118] The Casa Loma neighbourhood is named after ""Casa Loma"", a castle built in 1911 by Sir Henry Pellat, complete with gardens, turrets, stables, an elevator, secret passages, and a bowling alley.[119] Spadina House is a 19th-century manor that is now a museum.[120] Old Toronto Victorian-era Bay-and-gable houses are a distinct architectural style of residence that is ubiquitous throughout the older neighbourhoods of Toronto. The pre-amalgamation City of Toronto covers the downtown core and also older neighbourhoods to the east, west, and north of it. It is the most densely populated part of the city. The Financial District contains the First Canadian Place, Toronto-Dominion Centre, Scotia Plaza, Royal Bank Plaza, Commerce Court and Brookfield Place. This area includes, among others, the neighbourhoods of St. James Town, Garden District, St. Lawrence, Corktown, and Church and Wellesley. From that point, the Toronto skyline extends northward along Yonge Street.[citation needed] Old Toronto is also home to many historically wealthy residential enclaves, such as Yorkville, Rosedale, The Annex, Forest Hill, Lawrence Park, Lytton Park, Deer Park, Moore Park, and Casa Loma, most stretching away from downtown to the north.[citation needed] East and west of downtown, neighbourhoods such as Kensington Market, Chinatown, Leslieville, Cabbagetown and Riverdale are home to bustling commercial and cultural areas as well as communities of artists with studio lofts, with many middle- and upper-class professionals.[citation needed] Other neighbourhoods in the central city retain an ethnic identity, including two smaller Chinatowns, the Greektown area, Little Italy, Portugal Village, and Little India, among others.[citation needed] Suburbs In an attempt to curb suburban sprawl, many suburban neighbourhoods in Toronto encouraged high-density populations by mixing housing lots with apartment buildings far from the downtown core. The inner suburbs are contained within the former municipalities of York and East York.[121] These are mature and traditionally working-class areas, consisting primarily of post–World War I small, single-family homes and small apartment blocks.[121] Neighbourhoods such as Crescent Town, Thorncliffe Park, Weston, and Oakwood Village consist mainly of high-rise apartments, which are home to many new immigrant families. During the 2000s, many neighbourhoods have become ethnically diverse and have undergone gentrification as a result of increasing population, and a housing boom during the late 1990s and the early 21st century. The first neighbourhoods affected were Leaside and North Toronto, gradually progressing into the western neighbourhoods in York.[citation needed] The outer suburbs comprising the former municipalities of Etobicoke (west), Scarborough (east) and North York (north) largely retain the grid plan laid before post-war development.[122] Sections were long established and quickly growing towns before the suburban housing boom began and the emergence of metropolitan government, existing towns or villages such as Mimico, Islington and New Toronto in Etobicoke; Willowdale, Newtonbrook and Downsview in North York; Agincourt, Wexford and West Hill in Scarborough where suburban development boomed around or between these and other towns beginning in the late 1940s. Upscale neighbourhoods were built such as the Bridle Path in North York, the area surrounding the Scarborough Bluffs in Guildwood, and most of central Etobicoke, such as Humber Valley Village, and The Kingsway. One of largest and earliest ""planned communities"" was Don Mills, parts of which were first built in the 1950s.[123] Phased development, mixing single-detached housing with higher-density apartment blocks, became more popular as a suburban model of development. Over the late 20th century and early 21st century, North York City Centre, Etobicoke City Centre and Scarborough City Centre have emerged as secondary business districts outside Downtown Toronto. High-rise development in these areas has given the former municipalities distinguishable skylines of their own, with high-density transit corridors serving them.[citation needed] Industrial The Distillery District holds the largest collection of preserved Victorian industrial architecture in North America. In the 1800s, a thriving industrial area developed around Toronto Harbour and lower Don River mouth, linked by rail and water to Canada and the United States. Examples included the Gooderham and Worts Distillery, Canadian Malting Company, the Toronto Rolling Mills, the Union Stockyards and the Davies pork processing facility (the inspiration for the ""Hogtown"" nickname).[124][125] This industrial area expanded west along the harbour and rail lines and was supplemented by the infilling of the marshlands on the east side of the harbour to create the Port Lands. A garment industry developed along lower Spadina Avenue, the ""Fashion District"". Beginning in the late 19th century, industrial areas were set up on the outskirts, such as West Toronto/The Junction, where the Stockyards relocated in 1903.[126] The Great Fire of 1904 destroyed a large amount of industry in the downtown. Some of the companies moved west along King Street, some as far west as Dufferin Street; where the large Massey-Harris farm equipment manufacturing complex was located.[127] Over time, pockets of industrial land mostly followed rail lines and later highway corridors as the city grew outwards. This trend continues to this day, the largest factories and distribution warehouses are in the suburban environs of Peel and York Regions; but also within the current city: Etobicoke (concentrated around Pearson Airport), North York, and Scarborough.[citation needed] The West Don Lands is one of many former industrial sites in the downtown area that have undergone redevelopment. Many of Toronto's former industrial sites close to (or in) downtown have been redeveloped including parts of the Toronto waterfront, the rail yards west of downtown, and Liberty Village, the Massey-Harris district and large-scale development is underway in the West Don Lands.[citation needed] The Gooderham & Worts Distillery produced spirits until 1990, and is preserved today as the ""Distillery District"", the largest and best-preserved collection of Victorian industrial architecture in North America.[128] Some industry remains in the area, including the Redpath Sugar Refinery. Similar areas that retain their industrial character, but are now largely residential are the Fashion District, Corktown, and parts of South Riverdale and Leslieville. Toronto still has some active older industrial areas, such as Brockton Village, Mimico and New Toronto. In the west end of Old Toronto and York, the Weston/Mount Dennis and The Junction areas still contain factories, meat-packing facilities and rail yards close to medium-density residential, although the Junction's Union Stockyards moved out of Toronto in 1994.[126] The brownfield industrial area of the Port Lands, on the east side of the harbour, is one area planned for redevelopment.[129] Formerly a marsh that was filled in to create industrial space, it was never intensely developed — its land unsuitable for large-scale development — because of flooding and unstable soil.[130] It still contains numerous industrial uses, such as the Portlands Energy Centre power plant, some port facilities, some movie and TV production studios, a concrete processing facility and various low-density industrial facilities. The Waterfront Toronto agency has developed plans for a naturalized mouth to the Don River and to create a flood barrier around the Don, making more of the land on the harbour suitable for higher-value residential and commercial development.[131] A former chemicals plant site along the Don River is slated to become a large commercial complex and transportation hub.[132] Public spaces See also: List of Toronto parks This section needs additional citations for verification.

(July 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Nathan Phillips Square is the city's main square. The square includes a reflecting pool that is converted into an ice rink during the winter.[c] Toronto has a diverse array of public spaces, from city squares to public parks overlooking ravines. Nathan Phillips Square is the city's main square in downtown, contains the 3D Toronto sign,[133] and forms the entrance to City Hall. Yonge–Dundas Square, near City Hall, has also gained attention in recent years as one of the busiest gathering spots in the city. Other squares include Harbourfront Square, on the Toronto waterfront, and the civic squares at the former city halls of the defunct Metropolitan Toronto, most notably Mel Lastman Square in North York. The Toronto Public Space Committee is an advocacy group concerned with the city's public spaces. In recent years, Nathan Phillips Square has been refurbished with new facilities, and the central waterfront along Queen's Quay West has been updated recently with a new street architecture and a new square next to Harbourfront Centre. In the winter, Nathan Phillips Square, Harbourfront Centre, and Mel Lastman Square feature popular rinks for public ice-skating. Etobicoke's Colonel Sam Smith Trail opened in 2011 and is Toronto's first skating trail. Centennial Park and Earl Bales Park offer outdoor skiing and snowboarding slopes with a chairlift, rental facilities, and lessons. Several parks have marked cross-country skiing trails. There are many large downtown parks, which include Allan Gardens, Christie Pits, Grange Park, Little Norway Park, Moss Park, Queen's Park, Riverdale Park and Trinity Bellwoods Park. An almost hidden park is the compact Cloud Gardens,[134] which has both open areas and a glassed-in greenhouse, near Queen and Yonge. South of downtown are two large parks on the waterfront: Tommy Thompson Park on the Leslie Street Spit, which has a nature preserve, is open on weekends; and the Toronto Islands, accessible from downtown by ferry. Rouge National Urban Park is a national park in Scarborough. Large parks in the outer areas managed by the city include High Park, Humber Bay Park, Centennial Park, Downsview Park, Guild Park and Gardens, Sunnybrook Park and Morningside Park.[135] Toronto also operates several public golf courses. Most ravine lands and river bank floodplains in Toronto are public parklands. After Hurricane Hazel in 1954, construction of buildings on floodplains was outlawed, and private lands were bought for conservation. In 1999, Downsview Park, a former military base in North York, initiated an international design competition to realize its vision of creating Canada's first urban park. The winner, ""Tree City"", was announced in May 2000. Approximately 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres), or 12.5 percent of Toronto's land base is maintained parkland.[136] Morningside Park is the largest park managed by the city, which is 241.46 hectares (596.7 acres) in size.[136] In addition to public parks managed by the municipal government, parts of Rouge National Urban Park, the largest urban park in North America, is in the eastern portion of Toronto. Managed by Parks Canada, the national park is centred around the Rouge River and encompasses several municipalities in the Greater Toronto Area.[137] Culture Main article: Culture in Toronto See also: Annual events in Toronto, List of festivals in Toronto, and Recreation in Toronto This section needs additional citations for verification.

While Miami's foreign-born population has traditionally consisted primarily of Cubans and other Latin Americans, no single nationality or culture dominates Toronto's immigrant population, placing it among the most diverse cities in the world.[186] In 2010, it was estimated over 100,000 immigrants arrive in the Greater Toronto Area each year.[187] Ethnicity In 2016, the three most commonly reported ethnic origins overall were Chinese (332,830 or 12.5 per cent), English (331,890 or 12.3 per cent) and Canadian (323,175 or 12.0 per cent).[25] Common regions of ethnic origin were European (47.9 per cent), Asian (including Middle-Eastern – 40.1 per cent), African (5.5 per cent), Latin/Central/South American (4.2 per cent), and North American aboriginal (1.2 per cent).[25] In 2016, 51.5 per cent of the residents of the city proper belonged to a visible minority group, compared to 49.1 per cent in 2011,[25][188] and 13.6 per cent in 1981.[189] The largest visible minority groups were South Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan at 338,960 or 12.6 per cent), East Asian (Chinese at 332,830 or 12.5 per cent), and Black (239,850 or 8.9 per cent).[25] Visible minorities are projected to increase to 63 per cent of the city's population by 2031.[190] This diversity is reflected in Toronto's ethnic neighbourhoods, which include Chinatown, Corso Italia, Greektown, Kensington Market, Koreatown, Little India, Little Italy, Little Jamaica, Little Portugal and Roncesvalles (Polish community).[191] Religion Questions on religion is conducted in every other Canadian census, with the latest census to include them being the 2011 Canadian Census.[192] In 2011, the most commonly reported religion in Toronto was Christianity, adhered to by 54.1 per cent of the population.

The structure of the municipal government is stipulated by the City of Toronto Act. The mayor of Toronto is elected by direct popular vote to serve as the chief executive of the city. The Toronto City Council is a unicameral legislative body, comprising 25 councillors, since the 2018 municipal election, representing geographical wards throughout the city.[199] The mayor and members of the city council serve four-year terms without term limits. (Until the 2006 municipal election, the mayor and city councillors served three-year terms.) As of 2016, the city council has twelve standing committees, each consisting of a chair, (some have a vice-chair), and a number of councillors.[200] The mayor names the committee chairs and the remaining members of the committees are appointed by city council. An executive committee is formed by the chairs of each of standing committee, along with the mayor, the deputy mayor and four other councillors. Councillors are also appointed to oversee the Toronto Transit Commission and the Toronto Police Services Board. Toronto City Hall acts as the seat of the City of Toronto government. The city has four community councils that consider local matters. City council has delegated final decision-making authority on local, routine matters, while others—like planning and zoning issues—are recommended to the city council. Each city councillor serves as a member of a community council.[200] There are about 40 subcommittees and advisory committees appointed by the city council. These bodies are made up of city councillors and private citizen volunteers. Examples include the Pedestrian Committee, Waste Diversion Task Force 2010, and the Task Force to Bring Back the Don.[201] The City of Toronto had an approved operating budget of CA$13.53 billion in 2020 and a ten-year capital budget and plan of CA$43.5 billion.[202] The city's revenues include subsidies from the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario (for programs mandated by those governments), 33% from property tax, 6% from the land transfer tax and the rest from other tax revenues and user fees.[203] The city's largest operating expenditures are the Toronto Transit Commission at CA$2.14 billion,[204] and the Toronto Police Service, CA$1.22 billion.[205] Crime Main article: Crime in Toronto See also: Crime in Canada and Gun politics in Canada The historically low crime rate in Toronto has resulted in the city having a reputation as one of the safest major cities in North America.[206][207][208] For instance, in 2007, the homicide rate for Toronto was 3.3 per 100,000 people, compared with Atlanta (19.7), Boston (10.3), Los Angeles (10.0), New York City (6.3), Vancouver (3.1), and Montreal (2.6). Toronto's robbery rate also ranks low, with 207.1 robberies per 100,000 people, compared with Los Angeles (348.5), Vancouver (266.2), New York City (265.9), and Montreal (235.3).[209][210][211][212][213][214] Toronto has a comparable rate of car theft to various U.S. cities, although it is not among the highest in Canada.[206] In 2005, Toronto media coined the term ""Year of the Gun"", because of a record number of gun-related homicides, 52, out of 80 homicides in total.[208][215] The total number of homicides dropped to 70 in 2006; that year, nearly 2,000 people in Toronto were victims of a violent gun-related crime, about one-quarter of the national total.[216] 84 homicides were committed in 2007, roughly half of which involved guns. Gang-related incidents have also been on the rise; between the years of 1997 and 2005, over 300 gang-related homicides have occurred. As a result, the Ontario government developed an anti-gun strategy.[217] In 2011, Toronto's murder rate plummeted to 51 murders—nearly a 26% drop from the previous year. The 51 homicides were the lowest number the city has recorded since 1999 when there were 47.[218] While subsequent years did see a return to higher rates, it remained nearly flat line of 57–59 homicides in from 2012 to 2015. 2016 went to 75 for the first time in over 8 years. 2017 had a drop off of 10 murders to close the year at 65, with a homicide rate of 1.47 per 100,000 population.[219][220] The total number of homicides in Toronto reached a record 96 in 2018; the number included fatalities from the Toronto van attack and the Danforth shooting. The record year for per capita murders was previously 1991, with 3.9 murders per 100,000 people.[221] The 2018 homicide rate was higher than in Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Ottawa, Montreal, Hamilton, New York City, San Diego, and Austin.[222] Education Main article: Education in Toronto Further information: List of secondary schools in Ontario § City of Toronto There are four public school boards that provide elementary and secondary education in Toronto, the Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir, the Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), and the Toronto District School Board (TDSB).

In 2007, Toronto was reported as having some of the longer average emergency room waiting times in Ontario. Toronto hospitals at the time employed a system of triage to ensure life-threatening injuries receive rapid treatment.[230] After initial screening, initial assessments by physicians were completed within the waiting rooms themselves for greater efficiency, within a median of 1.2 hours. Tests, consultations, and initial treatments were also provided within waiting rooms. 50% of patients waited 4 hours before being transferred from the emergency room to another room.[230] The least-urgent 10% of cases wait over 12 hours.[230] The extended waiting-room times experienced by some patients were attributed to an overall shortage of acute care beds.[230] Toronto's MaRS Discovery District is a centre for research in biomedicine. Toronto's Discovery District[231] is a centre of research in biomedicine. It is on a 2.5-square-kilometre (620-acre) research park that is integrated into Toronto's downtown core.

Another institute is the McLaughlin Centre for Molecular Medicine (MCMM).[233] Specialized hospitals are also outside of the downtown core. These hospitals include the Baycrest Health Sciences geriatric hospital and the Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital for children with disabilities. Toronto is also host to a wide variety of health-focused non-profit organizations that work to address specific illnesses for Toronto, Ontario and Canadian residents. Organizations include Crohn's and Colitis Canada, the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, the Canadian Cancer Society, the Alzheimer Society of Canada, Alzheimer Society of Ontario and Alzheimer Society of Toronto, all located in the same office at Yonge–Eglinton, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Canada, the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation, the Canadian Foundation for AIDS Research, Cystic Fibrosis Canada, the Canadian Mental Health Association, the ALS Society of Canada, and many others. These organizations work to help people within the GTA, Ontario or Canada who are affected by these illnesses. Toronto is also home to the Geneva Centre for Autism. As well, most engage in fundraising to promote research, services, and public awareness. Transportation Union Station (center right) is a major commuter and inter-city transportation hub in downtown Toronto. Main article: Transportation in Toronto Toronto is a central transportation hub for road, rail and air networks in Southern Ontario. There are many forms of transport in the city of Toronto, including highways and public transit. Toronto also has an extensive network of bicycle lanes and multi-use trails and paths. Public transportation Main article: Public transportation in Toronto Toronto's main public transportation system is operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC).[63] The backbone of its public transport network is the Toronto subway system, which includes three heavy-rail rapid transit lines spanning the city, including the U-shaped Line 1 and east–west Line 2. Line 3 is a light metro line that exclusively serves the city's eastern district of Scarborough. The Toronto Transit Commission operates largest and busiest streetcar system in North America. The TTC also operates an extensive network of buses and streetcars, with the latter serving the downtown core, and buses providing service to many parts of the city not served by the sparse subway network. TTC buses and streetcars use the same fare system as the subway, and many subway stations offer a fare-paid area for transfers between rail and surface vehicles. There have been numerous plans to extend the subway and implement light-rail lines, but many efforts have been thwarted by budgetary concerns. Since July 2011, the only subway-related work is the Line 1 extension north of Sheppard West station (formerly named Downsview) to Vaughan Metropolitan Centre in Vaughan, a suburb north of Toronto. By November 2011, construction on Line 5 Eglinton began. Line 5 is scheduled to finish construction by 2022.[234][235] In 2015, the Ontario government promised to fund Line 6 Finch West which is to be completed by 2023. In 2019, the Government of Ontario released a transit plan for the Greater Toronto Area which includes a new 16-kilometres Ontario Line,[236] Line 1 extension to Richmond Hill Centre[237] and an extension for Line 5 Eglinton to Toronto Pearson Airport.[238][239] Toronto's century-old Union Station is also getting a major renovation and upgrade which would be able to accommodate more rail traffic from GO Transit, Via Rail, UP Express and Amtrak.[240] Construction on a new Union Station Bus Terminal is also in the works with an expected completion in 2020.[241] Toronto's public transit network also connects to other municipal networks such as York Region Transit, Viva, Durham Region Transit, and MiWay. The Government of Ontario operates a commuter rail and bus transit system called GO Transit in the Greater Toronto Area. GO Transit carries over 250,000 passengers every weekday (2013) and 57 million annually, with a majority of them travelling to or from Union Station.[242][243] Metrolinx is currently implementing Regional Express Rail into its GO Transit network and plans to electrify many of its rail lines by 2030.[244] Airports Interior of Toronto Pearson International Airport's Terminal 1. Toronto Pearson serves as the international airport for the Greater Toronto Area. Canada's busiest airport, Toronto Pearson International Airport (IATA: YYZ), straddles the city's western boundary with the suburban city of Mississauga. The Union Pearson Express (UP Express) train service provides a direct link between Pearson International and Union Station. It began carrying passengers in June 2015. Limited commercial and passenger service to nearby destinations in Canada and the USA is offered from the Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport (IATA: YTZ) on the Toronto Islands, southwest of downtown. Buttonville Municipal Airport (IATA: YKZ) in Markham provides general aviation facilities. Downsview Airport (IATA: YZD), near the city's north end, is owned by de Havilland Canada and serves the Bombardier Aviation aircraft factory. Within a few hours' drive, Hamilton's John C. Munro International Airport (IATA: YHM) and Buffalo's Buffalo Niagara International Airport (IATA: BUF) serve as alternate airports for the Toronto area in addition to serving their respective cities. A secondary international airport, to be located north-east of Toronto in Pickering, has been planned by the Government of Canada. Intercity transportation Toronto Union Station serves as a hub for VIA Rail's intercity services in Central Canada and includes services to various parts of Ontario, Corridor services to Montreal and national capital Ottawa, and long-distance services to Vancouver and New York City. The Toronto Coach Terminal in downtown Toronto also serves as a hub for intercity bus services in Southern Ontario, served by multiple companies and providing a comprehensive network of services in Ontario and neighbouring provinces and states. GO Transit provides intercity bus services from the Union Station Bus Terminal and other bus terminals in the city to destinations within the greater Toronto area. Road system Highway 401 is a 400-series highway that passes west to east through Greater Toronto. Toronto's portion of Highway 401 is the busiest highway in North America. The grid of major city streets was laid out by a concession road system, in which major arterial roads are 6,600 ft (2.0 km) apart (with some exceptions, particularly in Scarborough and Etobicoke, as they used a different survey). Major east-west arterial roads are generally parallel with the Lake Ontario shoreline, and major north–south arterial roads are roughly perpendicular to the shoreline, though slightly angled north of Eglinton Avenue. This arrangement is sometimes broken by geographical accidents, most notably the Don River ravines. Toronto's grid north is approximately 18.5° to the west of true north. Many arterials, particularly north–south ones, due to the city originally being within the former York County, continue beyond the city into the 905 suburbs and further into the rural countryside. There are a number of municipal expressways and provincial highways that serve Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area. In particular, Highway 401 bisects the city from west to east, bypassing the downtown core. It is the busiest road in North America,[245] and one of the busiest highways in the world.[246][247] Other provincial highways include Highway 400 which connects the city with Northern Ontario and beyond and Highway 404, an extension of the Don Valley Parkway into the northern suburbs. The Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW), North America's first divided intercity highway, terminates at Toronto's western boundary and connects Toronto to Niagara Falls and Buffalo. The main municipal expressways in Toronto include the Gardiner Expressway, the Don Valley Parkway, and to some extent, Allen Road. Toronto's traffic congestion is one of the highest in North America, and is the second highest in Canada after Vancouver.[248] Notable people Main article: List of people from Toronto Sister cities Main article: Sister cities of Toronto Partnership cities Chicago, Illinois, United States (1991)[249] Chongqing, China (1986)[249] Frankfurt, Germany (1989)[249] Milan, Italy (2003)[249] Friendship cities Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (2006)[249] Kyiv, Ukraine (1992)[249] Quito, Ecuador (2006)[249] Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (2015)[249] Sagamihara, Japan (1991)[249] Warsaw, Poland (1990)[249] See also Canada portal Ontario portal Outline of Toronto (extensive topic list) Great Lakes Megalopolis Largest cities in the Americas List of metropolitan areas in the Americas Notes ^ The motto is typically rendered without punctuation, while the city's coat of arms uses typographical bullets to space the words used in the motto.

Ontario is bordered by the province of Manitoba to the west, Hudson Bay and James Bay to the north, and Quebec to the east and northeast, and to the south by the U.S. states of (from west to east) Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. Almost all of Ontario's 2,700 km (1,678 mi) border with the United States follows inland waterways: from the westerly Lake of the Woods, eastward along the major rivers and lakes of the Great Lakes/Saint Lawrence River drainage system. These include Rainy River, Pigeon River, Lake Superior, St. Marys River, Lake Huron, St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, Detroit River, Lake Erie, Niagara River, Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River from Kingston, to the Quebec boundary just east of Cornwall. There is only about 1 km (0.6 mi) of land border, made up of portages including Height of Land Portage on the Minnesota border.[13] Ontario is sometimes conceptually divided into two regions, Northern Ontario and Southern Ontario. The great majority of Ontario's population and arable land is in the south. In contrast, the larger, northern part of Ontario is sparsely populated with cold winters and heavy forestation.[14] Contents 1 Etymology 2 Geography 2.1 Climate 3 History 3.1 Pre-European contact 3.2 European contact 3.3 Upper Canada 3.4 Canada West 3.5 Provincehood 3.6 Territorial evolution 4 Demographics 4.1 Religion 4.2 Language 5 Economy 5.1 Agriculture 5.2 Energy 6 Government, law and politics 6.1 Law 6.2 Politics 6.3 Administrative divisions 6.4 Urban areas 7 Education 7.1 Higher education 8 Culture 8.1 Songs and slogans 8.2 Professional sports 8.3 Notable residents 8.4 Museums 9 Transportation 9.1 Air travel 9.2 Railways 9.3 Roads 9.4 Waterways 10 See also 11 Notes 12 References 12.1 Citations 12.2 Sources 13 Further reading 14 External links Etymology[edit] The province is named after Lake Ontario, a term thought to be derived from Ontarí:io, a Huron (Wyandot) word meaning ""great lake"",[15] or possibly skanadario, which means ""beautiful water"" in the Iroquoian languages.[16] Ontario has about 250,000 freshwater lakes.[17] Geography[edit] Main article: Geography of Ontario See also: List of census divisions of Ontario, Geography of Canada, and List of parks and protected areas of Ontario Typical landscape of the Canadian Shield at Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park, located in Central Ontario The province consists of three main geographical regions: The thinly populated Canadian Shield in the northwestern and central portions, which comprises over half the land area of Ontario. Although this area mostly does not support agriculture, it is rich in minerals, partly covered by the Central and Midwestern Canadian Shield forests, and studded with lakes and rivers. Northern Ontario is subdivided into two sub-regions: Northwestern Ontario and Northeastern Ontario. The virtually unpopulated Hudson Bay Lowlands in the extreme north and northeast, mainly swampy and sparsely forested. Southern Ontario, which is further sub-divided into four sub-regions: Central Ontario (although not actually the province's geographic centre), Eastern Ontario, Golden Horseshoe and Southwestern Ontario (parts of which were formerly referred to as Western Ontario). Despite the absence of any mountainous terrain in the province, there are large areas of uplands, particularly within the Canadian Shield which traverses the province from northwest to southeast and also above the Niagara Escarpment which crosses the south. The highest point is Ishpatina Ridge at 693 metres (2,274 ft) above sea level in Temagami, Northeastern Ontario. In the south, elevations of over 500 m (1,640 ft) are surpassed near Collingwood, above the Blue Mountains in the Dundalk Highlands and in hilltops near the Madawaska River in Renfrew County. The Carolinian forest zone covers most of the southwestern region of the province. The temperate and fertile Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence Valley in the south is part of the Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests ecoregion where the forest has now been largely replaced by agriculture, industrial and urban development. A well-known geographic feature is Niagara Falls, part of the Niagara Escarpment. The Saint Lawrence Seaway allows navigation to and from the Atlantic Ocean as far inland as Thunder Bay in Northwestern Ontario. Northern Ontario covers approximately 87% of the province's surface area; conversely Southern Ontario contains 94% of the population. Point Pelee is a peninsula of Lake Erie in southwestern Ontario (near Windsor and Detroit, Michigan) that is the southernmost extent of Canada's mainland. Pelee Island and Middle Island in Lake Erie extend slightly farther. All are south of 42°N – slightly farther south than the northern border of California. Climate[edit] See also: Climate of Ontario Köppen climate types of Ontario Ontario's climate varies by season and location.[18] Three air sources affect it: cold, dry, arctic air from the north (dominant factor during the winter months, and for a longer part of the year in far northern Ontario); Pacific polar air crossing in from the western Canadian Prairies/US Northern Plains; and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.[19] The effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude, proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent, terrain relief.[19] In general, most of Ontario's climate is classified as humid continental.[19] Ontario has three main climatic regions: The surrounding Great Lakes greatly influence the climatic region of southern Ontario.[18] During the fall and winter, the release of heat stored by the lakes moderates the climate near the shores.[20] This gives parts of southern Ontario milder winters than mid-continental areas at lower latitudes.[20] Parts of Southwestern Ontario (generally south of a line from Sarnia–Toronto) have a moderate humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa), similar to the inland Mid-Atlantic states and the Great Lakes portion of the Midwestern United States. The region has warm to hot, humid summers and cold winters. Annual precipitation ranges from 750–1,000 mm (30–39 in) and is well distributed throughout the year. Most of this region lies in the lee of the Great Lakes, making for abundant snow in some areas. In December 2010, the snowbelt set a new record when it was hit by more than a metre of snow within 48 hours.[21] The next climatic region is Central and Eastern Ontario, which has a moderate humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb). This region has warm and sometimes hot summers with colder, longer winters, ample snowfall (even in regions not directly in the snowbelts) and annual precipitation similar to the rest of Southern Ontario.[19] In the northeastern parts of Ontario, extending south as far as Kirkland Lake, the cold waters of Hudson Bay depress summer temperatures, making it cooler than other locations at similar latitudes. The same is true on the northern shore of Lake Superior, which cools hot, humid air from the south, leading to cooler summer temperatures.[19] Along the eastern shores of Lake Superior and Lake Huron winter temperatures are slightly moderated but come with frequent heavy lake-effect snow squalls that increase seasonal snowfall totals to upwards of 3 m (10 ft) in some places. These regions have higher annual precipitation, in some places over 100 cm (39 in). Cold northwesterly wind over the Great Lakes creating lake-effect snow. Lake-effect snow most frequently occurs in the snowbelt regions of the province. The northernmost parts of Ontario – primarily north of 50°N – have a subarctic climate (Köppen Dfc) with long, severely cold winters and short, cool to warm summers with dramatic temperature changes possible in all seasons. With no major mountain ranges blocking sinking Arctic air masses, temperatures of −40 °C (−40 °F) are not uncommon; snow remains on the ground for sometimes over half the year. Snow accumulation can be high in some areas.[18] Precipitation is generally less than 70 cm (28 in) and peaks in the summer months in the form of rain or thunderstorms.[18] Severe thunderstorms peak in summer. Windsor, in Southern (Southwestern) Ontario, has the most lightning strikes per year in Canada, averaging 33 days of thunderstorm activity per year.[22] In a typical year, Ontario averages 11 confirmed tornado touchdowns. However, over the last 4 years,[when?] it has had upwards of 20 tornado touchdowns per year, with the highest frequency in the Windsor-Essex – Chatham Kent area, though few are very destructive (the majority between F0 to F2 on the Fujita scale). Ontario had a record 29 tornadoes in both 2006 and 2009. Tropical depression remnants occasionally bring heavy rains and winds in the south, but are rarely deadly. A notable exception was Hurricane Hazel which struck Southern Ontario centred on Toronto, in October 1954.

Samuel de Champlain reached Lake Huron in 1615, and French missionaries began to establish posts along the Great Lakes. French settlement was hampered by their hostilities with the Iroquois, who allied themselves with the British.[37] From 1634 to 1640, Hurons were devastated by European infectious diseases, such as measles and smallpox, to which they had no immunity.[38] By 1700, the Iroquois had been driven out or left the area that would become Ontario and the Mississaugas of the Ojibwa had settled the north shore of Lake Ontario. The remaining Huron settled north of Quebec. The British established trading posts on Hudson Bay in the late 17th century and began a struggle for domination of Ontario with the French. After the French of New France were defeated during the Seven Years' War, the two powers awarded nearly all of France's North American possessions (New France) to Britain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris, including those lands of Ontario not already claimed by Britain. The British annexed the Ontario region to Quebec in 1774.[39] A monument in Hamilton commemorating the United Empire Loyalists, a group of settlers who fled the United States during or after the American Revolution The first European settlements were in 1782–1784 when 5,000 United Empire Loyalists entered what is now Ontario following the American Revolution.[40] The Kingdom of Great Britain granted them 200 acres (81 ha) land and other items with which to rebuild their lives.[37] The British also set up reserves in Ontario for the Mohawks who had fought for the British and had lost their land in New York state. Other Iroquois, also displaced from New York were resettled in 1784 at the Six Nations reserve at the west end of Lake Ontario. The Mississaugas, displaced by European settlements, would later move to Six Nations also. A second wave of Americans, not all of them necessarily loyalists moved to Upper Canada after 1790 until the pre-war of 1812, many seeking available cheap land, and at the time, lower taxation. The population of Canada west of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence substantially increased during this period, a fact recognized by the Constitutional Act of 1791, which split Quebec into the Canadas: Upper Canada southwest of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence, and Lower Canada east of it. John Graves Simcoe was appointed Upper Canada's first Lieutenant governor in 1793.[41] Upper Canada[edit] Main article: Upper Canada American troops in the War of 1812 invaded Upper Canada across the Niagara River and the Detroit River, but were defeated and pushed back by the British, Canadian fencibles and militias, and First Nations warriors. However, the Americans eventually gained control of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The 1813 Battle of York saw American troops defeat the garrison at the Upper Canada capital of York. The Americans looted the town and burned the Upper Canada Parliament Buildings during their brief occupation. The British would burn the American capital of Washington, D.C. in 1814. Depiction of the Battle of Queenston Heights, during the War of 1812. Upper Canada was an active theatre of operation during the conflict. After the War of 1812, relative stability allowed for increasing numbers of immigrants to arrive from Europe rather than from the United States. As was the case in the previous decades, this immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders. Despite affordable and often free land, many arriving newcomers, mostly from Britain and Ireland, found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult, and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south. However, population growth far exceeded emigration in the following decades. It was a mostly agrarian-based society, but canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the United States, thereby improving previously damaged relations over time. Meanwhile, Ontario's numerous waterways aided travel and transportation into the interior and supplied water power for development. As the population increased, so did the industries and transportation networks, which in turn led to further development. By the end of the century, Ontario vied with Quebec as the nation's leader in terms of growth in population, industry, arts and communications.[42] Unrest in the colony began to chafe against the aristocratic Family Compact who governed while benefiting economically from the region's resources, and who did not allow elected bodies power. This resentment spurred republican ideals and sowed the seeds for early Canadian nationalism. Accordingly, rebellion in favour of responsible government rose in both regions; Louis-Joseph Papineau led the Lower Canada Rebellion and William Lyon Mackenzie, first Toronto mayor,[43] led the Upper Canada Rebellion. In Upper Canada, the rebellion was quickly a failure. William Lyon Mackenzie escaped to the United States, where he declared the Republic of Canada on Navy Island on the Niagara River.[44] Canada West[edit] Main article: Province of Canada A map highlighting the Canadas, with Upper Canada in orange, and Lower Canada in green. In 1841, the two colonies were united to form the Province of Canada. Although both rebellions were put down in short order, the British government sent Lord Durham to investigate the causes. He recommended self-government be granted and Lower and Upper Canada be re-joined in an attempt to assimilate the French Canadians. Accordingly, the two colonies were merged into the Province of Canada by the Act of Union 1840, with the capital at Kingston, and Upper Canada becoming known as Canada West.[45] Parliamentary self-government was granted in 1848. There were heavy waves of immigration in the 1840s, and the population of Canada West more than doubled by 1851 over the previous decade. As a result, for the first time, the English-speaking population of Canada West surpassed the French-speaking population of Canada East, tilting the representative balance of power. An economic boom in the 1850s coincided with railway expansion across the province, further increasing the economic strength of Central Canada. With the repeal of the Corn Laws and a reciprocity agreement in place with the United States, various industries such as timber, mining, farming and alcohol distilling benefited tremendously. A political stalemate between the French- and English-speaking legislators, as well as fear of aggression from the United States during and immediately after the American Civil War, led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the 1860s to effect a broader federal union of all British North American colonies. The British North America Act took effect on July 1, 1867, establishing the Dominion of Canada, initially with four provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario. The Province of Canada was divided into Ontario and Quebec so that each linguistic group would have its own province. Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the British North America Act to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of the Protestant and Catholic minorities. Thus, separate Catholic schools and school boards were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario's provincial capital. Provincehood[edit] Oliver Mowat, Premier of Ontario from 1872 to 1896 Once constituted as a province, Ontario proceeded to assert its economic and legislative power. In 1872, the lawyer Oliver Mowat became Premier of Ontario and remained as premier until 1896. He fought for provincial rights, weakening the power of the federal government in provincial matters, usually through well-argued appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. His battles with the federal government greatly decentralized Canada, giving the provinces far more power than John A. Macdonald had intended. He consolidated and expanded Ontario's educational and provincial institutions, created districts in Northern Ontario, and fought to ensure that those parts of Northwestern Ontario not historically part of Upper Canada (the vast areas north and west of the Lake Superior-Hudson Bay watershed, known as the District of Keewatin) would become part of Ontario, a victory embodied in the Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889. He also presided over the emergence of the province into the economic powerhouse of Canada. Mowat was the creator of what is often called Empire Ontario. Beginning with Macdonald's National Policy (1879) and the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (1875–1885) through Northern Ontario and the Canadian Prairies to British Columbia, Ontario manufacturing and industry flourished. However, population increases slowed after a large recession hit the province in 1893, thus slowing growth drastically but for only a few years. Many newly arrived immigrants and others moved west along the railway to the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia, sparsely settling Northern Ontario. Mineral exploitation accelerated in the late 19th century, leading to the rise of important mining centres in the northeast, such as Sudbury, Cobalt and Timmins. The province harnessed its water power to generate hydro-electric power and created the state-controlled Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, later Ontario Hydro. The availability of cheap electric power further facilitated the development of industry. The Ford Motor Company of Canada was established in 1904 and the McLaughlin Motor Car Company (later General Motors Canada) was founded in 1907. The motor vehicle industry became the most lucrative industry for the Ontario economy during the 20th century. In July 1912, the Conservative government of James Whitney issued Regulation 17 which severely limited the availability of French-language schooling to the province's French-speaking minority. French Canadians reacted with outrage, journalist Henri Bourassa denouncing the ""Prussians of Ontario"". The regulation was eventually repealed in 1927. Law enforcement confiscate stores of alcohol in Elk Lake in an effort to enforce prohibition. The prohibition measures were introduced in 1916 and were not repealed until 1927. Influenced by events in the United States, the government of William Hearst introduced prohibition of alcoholic drinks in 1916 with the passing of the Ontario Temperance Act. However, residents could distil and retain their own personal supply, and liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale, allowing this already sizeable industry to strengthen further. Ontario became a hotbed for the illegal smuggling of liquor and the biggest supplier into the United States, which was under complete prohibition. Prohibition in Ontario came to an end in 1927 with the establishment of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario under the government of Howard Ferguson. The sale and consumption of liquor, wine, and beer are still controlled by some of the most extreme laws in North America to ensure strict community standards and revenue generation from the alcohol retail monopoly are upheld. The post-World War II period was one of exceptional prosperity and growth. Ontario has been the recipients of most immigration to Canada, largely immigrants from war-torn Europe in the 1950s and 1960s and following changes in federal immigration law, a massive influx of non-Europeans since the 1970s. From a largely ethnically British province, Ontario has rapidly become culturally very diverse. A monument commemorating the immigrant family in Toronto. The province saw a large number of migrants settle in Ontario in the decades following World War II. The nationalist movement in Quebec, particularly after the election of the Parti Québécois in 1976, contributed to driving many businesses and English-speaking people out of Quebec to Ontario, and as a result, Toronto surpassed Montreal as the largest city and economic centre of Canada.[46] Depressed economic conditions in the Maritime Provinces have also resulted in de-population of those provinces in the 20th century, with heavy migration into Ontario.[47][48] Ontario's official language is English, although there exists a number of French-speaking communities across Ontario.[49] French-language services are made available for communities with a sizeable French-speaking population; a service that is ensured under the French Language Services Act of 1989. Territorial evolution[edit] Until 1763, most of Ontario was considered part of New France by French claim. Rupert's Land, defined as the drainage basin of Hudson Bay, was claimed by Britain, and included much of today's Northern Ontario. The British defeated the armies of the French colony and its indigenous allies in the French and Indian War, part of the Seven Years' War global conflict. Concluding the war, the peace treaty between the European powers, known as the Treaty of Paris 1763, assigned almost all of France's possessions in North America to Britain, including parts that would later become Ontario not already part of Rupert's Land. Britain established the first Province of Quebec, encompassing contemporary Quebec and southern Ontario. After the American War of Independence, the first reserves for First Nations were established. These are situated at Six Nations (1784), Tyendinaga (1793) and Akwesasne (1795). Six Nations and Tyendinaga were established by the British for those indigenous groups who had fought on the side of the British, and were expelled from the new United States. Akwesasne was a pre-existing Mohawk community and its borders were formalized under the 1795 Jay Treaty. In 1788, while part of the Province of Quebec, southern Ontario was divided into four districts: Hesse, Lunenburg, Mecklenburg, and Nassau. In 1792, the four districts were renamed: Hesse became the Western District, Lunenburg became the Eastern District, Mecklenburg became the Midland District, and Nassau became the Home District. Counties were created within the districts. By 1798, there were eight districts: Eastern, Home, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, and Western. By 1826, there were eleven districts: Bathurst, Eastern, Gore, Home, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, Ottawa, and Western. By 1838, there were twenty districts: Bathurst, Brock, Colbourne, Dalhousie, Eastern, Gore, Home, Huron, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, Ottawa, Prince Edward, Simcoe, Talbot, Victoria, Wellington, and Western. In 1849, the districts of southern Ontario were abolished by the Province of Canada, and county governments took over certain municipal responsibilities. The Province of Canada also began creating districts in sparsely populated Northern Ontario with the establishment of Algoma District and Nipissing District in 1858. Evolution of the borders of Ontario since Canadian Confederation in 1867 The borders of Ontario, its new name in 1867, were provisionally expanded north and west. When the Province of Canada was formed, its borders were not entirely clear, and Ontario claimed eventually to reach all the way to the Rocky Mountains and Arctic Ocean. With Canada's acquisition of Rupert's Land, Ontario was interested in clearly defining its borders, especially since some of the new areas in which it was interested were rapidly growing. After the federal government asked Ontario to pay for construction in the new disputed area, the province asked for an elaboration on its limits, and its boundary was moved north to the 51st parallel north.[50] The northern and western boundaries of Ontario were in dispute after Canadian Confederation. Ontario's right to Northwestern Ontario was determined by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1884 and confirmed by the Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. By 1899, there were seven northern districts: Algoma, Manitoulin, Muskoka, Nipissing, Parry Sound, Rainy River, and Thunder Bay. Four more northern districts were created between 1907 and 1912: Cochrane, Kenora, Sudbury and Timiskaming.[51] Demographics[edit] Main article: Demographics of Ontario Population density of Ontario Historical populationsYearPop.±%1851952,004—    18611,396,091+46.6%18711,620,851+16.1%18811,926,922+18.9%18912,114,321+9.7%19012,182,947+3.2%19112,527,292+15.8%19212,933,662+16.1%19313,431,683+17.0%19413,787,655+10.4%19514,597,542+21.4%19565,404,933+17.6%19616,236,092+15.4%19666,960,870+11.6%19717,703,105+10.7%19768,264,465+7.3%19818,625,107+4.4%19869,101,695+5.5%199110,084,885+10.8%199610,753,573+6.6%200111,410,046+6.1%200612,160,282+6.6%201112,851,821+5.7%201613,448,494+4.6%Source: Statistics Canada In the 2016 census, Ontario had a population of 13,448,494 living in 5,169,174 of its 5,598,391 total dwellings, a 4.6 percent change from its 2011 population of 12,851,821. With a land area of 908,607.67 km2 (350,815.38 sq mi), it had a population density of 14.8/km2 (38.3/sq mi) in 2016.[52] The largest population centres in Ontario are Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton, Kitchener, London and Oshawa which all have more than 300,000 inhabitants. The percentages given below add to more than 100 per cent because of dual responses (e.g., ""French and Canadian"" response generates an entry both in the category ""French Canadian"" and in the category ""Canadian""). The majority of Ontarians are of English or other European descent including large Scottish, Irish and Italian communities. Slightly less than 5 per cent of the population of Ontario is Franco-Ontarian, that is those whose native tongue is French, although those with French ancestry account for 11 per cent of the population. In relation to natural increase or inter-provincial migration, immigration is a huge population growth force in Ontario, as it has been over the last two centuries. More recent sources of immigrants with large or growing communities in Ontario include South Asians, Caribbeans, Latin Americans, Europeans, Asians, and Africans. Most populations have settled in the larger urban centres. In 2011, 25.9 per cent of the population consisted of visible minorities and 2.4 per cent of the population was Indigenous, mostly of First Nations and Métis descent. There was also a small number of Inuit people in the province. The number of Aboriginal people and visible minorities has been increasing at a faster rate than the general population of Ontario.[53] Religion[edit] In 2011, the largest religious denominations in Ontario were the Roman Catholic Church (with 31.4% of the population), the United Church of Canada (7.5%), and the Anglican Church (6.1%). 23.1% of Ontarians had no religious affiliation, making it the second-largest religious grouping in the province after Roman Catholics.[54] The major religious groups in Ontario in 2011 were: Religion People % Total 12,651,795 100 Catholic 3,976,610 31.4 No religious affiliation 2,927,790 23.1 Protestant 2,668,665 21.1 Other Christians 1,224,300 9.7 Muslim 581,950 4.6 Hindu 366,720 2.9 Christian Orthodox 297,710 2.4 Jewish 195,540 1.5 Sikh 179,765 1.4 Buddhist 163,750 1.3 Other religions 68,985 0.5 In Ontario, Catholics are represented by the Assembly of Catholic Bishops of Ontario[55] and the Anglican Protestants by the Ecclesiastical Province of Ontario.[56] The Ecclesiastical Province covers most of the geographical province of Ontario[56] Language[edit] See also: Franco-Ontarian English and French displayed on a gantry sign. Communities with sizeable Francophone populations are able to receive provincial services in French. The principal language of Ontario is English, the province's de facto official language,[57] with approximately 97.2 per cent of Ontarians having proficiency in the language, although only 69.5 per cent of Ontarians reported English as their mother tongue in the 2016 Census.[58] English is one of two official languages of Canada, with the other being French. English and French are the official languages of the courts in Ontario. Approximately 4.6 per cent of the population were identified as francophones,[59][note 1] with 11.5 per cent of Ontarians having proficiency in French.[58] Approximately 11.2 per cent of Ontarians reported being bilingual in both official languages of Canada.[58] Approximately 2.5 per cent of Ontarians have no proficiency in either English or French.[58] Franco-Ontarians are concentrated in the northeastern, eastern, and extreme Southern parts of the province, where under the French Language Services Act,[60] provincial government services are required to be available in French if at least 10 per cent of a designated area's population report French as their native language or if an urban centre has at least 5,000 francophones. Other languages spoken by residents include Arabic, Bengali, Cantonese, Dutch, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Hebrew, Italian, Korean, Malayalam, Mandarin, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Russian, Sinhalese, Somali, Spanish, Tagalog, Telugu, Tamil, Tibetan, Ukrainian, Urdu, and Vietnamese.[61] Economy[edit] Main article: Economy of Ontario Ontario is Canada's leading manufacturing province, accounting for 52% of the total national manufacturing shipments in 2004.[62] Ontario's largest trading partner is the American state of Michigan. As of April 2012[update], Moody's bond-rating agency rated Ontario debt at AA2/stable,[63] while S&P rated it AA-.[64] Dominion Bond Rating Service rated it AA(low) in January 2013.[65] Long known as a bastion of Canadian manufacturing and financial solvency, Ontario's public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to be 38.4% in fiscal year 2023–2024.[66] Container ship at Algoma Steel. The Great Lakes provide ocean access for industries in the province's interior. Mining and the forest products industry, notably pulp and paper, are vital to the economy of Northern Ontario. As of 2011, roughly 200,000 ha are clearcut each year; herbicides for hardwood suppression are applied to a third of the total.[67] There has been controversy over the Ring of Fire mineral deposit, and whether the province can afford to spend CAD$2.25 billion on a road from the Trans-Canada Highway near Kenora to the deposit, currently valued at CAD$60 billion.[68] An abundance of natural resources, excellent transportation links to the North American heartland and the inland Great Lakes making ocean access possible via container ships, have all contributed to making manufacturing the principal industry of the province, found mainly in the Golden Horseshoe region, which is the largest industrialized area in Canada, the southern end of the region being part of the North American Rust Belt. Important products include motor vehicles, iron, steel, food, electrical appliances, machinery, chemicals, and paper. Hamilton is the largest steel manufacturing city in Canada followed closely by Sault Ste. Marie, and Sarnia is the centre for petrochemical production. Construction employed more than 6.5% of the province's work force in June 2011.[69] Ontario's steel industry was once centred in Hamilton. Hamilton harbour, which can be seen from the QEW Skyway bridge, is an industrial wasteland; U.S. Steel-owned Stelco announced in the autumn of 2013 that it would close in 2014, with the loss of 875 jobs. The move flummoxed a union representative, who seemed puzzled why a plant with capacity of 2 million tons per annum would be shut while Canada imported 8 million tons of steel the previous year.[70] Algoma Steel maintains a plant in Sault Ste Marie. A worker at the Oakville Assembly installs a battery in an automobile. The automotive industry is a contributor to the economy of Ontario. Ontario surpassed Michigan in car production, assembling 2.696 million vehicles in 2004. Ontario has Chrysler plants in Windsor and Bramalea, two GM plants in Oshawa and one in Ingersoll, a Honda assembly plant in Alliston, Ford plants in Oakville and St. Thomas and Toyota assembly plants in Cambridge and Woodstock. However, as a result of steeply declining sales, in 2005, General Motors announced massive layoffs at production facilities across North America, including two large GM plants in Oshawa and a drive train facility in St. Catharines, that resulted in 8,000 job losses in Ontario alone. In 2006, Ford Motor Company announced between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs phased until 2012; Ontario was spared the worst, but job losses were announced for the St Thomas facility and the Windsor Casting plant. However, these losses will be offset by Ford's recent announcement of a hybrid vehicle facility slated to begin production in 2007 at its Oakville plant and GM's re-introduction of the Camaro which will be produced in Oshawa. On December 4, 2008, Toyota announced the grand opening of the RAV4 plant in Woodstock,[71] and Honda also plans to add an engine plant at its facility in Alliston. Despite these new plants coming online, Ontario has not yet fully recovered following massive layoffs caused by the global recession; its unemployment rate was 7.3% in May 2013,[72] compared to 8.7 percent in January 2010[73] and approximately 6% in 2007. In September 2013, the Ontario government committed CAD$70.9 million to the Ford plant in Oakville, while the federal government committed CAD$71.1mn, to secure 2,800 jobs.[74] The province has lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs in the decade from 2003, and the Bank of Canada noted that ""while the energy and mining industries have benefitted from these movements, the pressure on the manufacturing sector has intensified, since many firms in this sector were already dealing with growing competition from low-cost economies such as China.""[75][76] Toronto's Financial District serves as the centre for Canada's financial services. Toronto, the capital of Ontario, is the centre of Canada's financial services and banking industry. Neighbouring cities are home to product distribution, IT centres, and manufacturing industries. Canada's Federal Government is the largest single employer in the National Capital Region, which centres on the border cities of Ontario's Ottawa and Quebec's Gatineau.[77][78] The information technology sector is important, particularly in the Silicon Valley North section of Ottawa, home to Canada's largest technology park.[79] IT is also important in the Waterloo Region, where the headquarters of BlackBerry is located.[80] Tourism contributes heavily to the economy of Central Ontario, peaking during the summer months owing to the abundance of fresh water recreation and wilderness found there in reasonable proximity to the major urban centres. At other times of the year, hunting, skiing and snowmobiling are popular. This region has some of the most vibrant fall colour displays anywhere on the continent, and tours directed at overseas visitors are organized to see them. Tourism also plays a key role in border cities with large casinos, among them Windsor, Cornwall, Sarnia and Niagara Falls, the latter of which attracts millions of US and other international visitors.[81] Agriculture[edit] Aerial view of farms in Waterloo. A significant portion of the land in Southern Ontario is used as farmland. Once the dominant industry, agriculture now uses a small percentage of the workforce. However, much of the land in southern Ontario is given over to agriculture. As the following table shows, while the number of individual farms has steadily decreased and their overall size has shrunk at a lower rate, greater mechanization has supported increased supply to satisfy the ever-increasing demands of a growing population base; this has also meant a gradual increase in the total amount of land used for growing crops. Ontario Farming 1986 1991 1996 2001 2006 Number of Farms 72,713 68,633 67,520 59,728 57,211 Total Hectares 5,646,582 5,451,379 5,616,860 5,466,233 5,386,453 Acres 13,953,009 13,470,652 13,879,565 13,507,358 13,310,217 Planted Crops Hectares 3,457,966 3,411,667 3,544,927 3,656,705 3,660,941 Acres 8,544,821 8,430,438 8,759,707 9,035,916 9,046,383 Source: Statistics Canada, Census of Agriculture.[82] vte Grapevines growing in Prince Edward County, a wine-growing region Common types of farms reported in the 2001 census include those for cattle, small grains and dairy. The fruit- and wine industry is primarily on the Niagara Peninsula, Prince Edward County, and along the northern shore of Lake Erie, where tobacco farms are also situated. Market vegetables grow in the rich soils of the Holland Marsh near Newmarket. The area near Windsor is also very fertile. The Heinz plant in Leamington was taken over in these autumn of 2013 by Warren Buffett and a Brazilian partner, following which it put 740 people out of work.[83] Government subsidies followed shortly; Premier Kathleen Wynne offered CAD$200,000 to cushion the blow, and promised that another processed-food operator would soon be found.[84] On December 10, 2013, Kellogg's announced layoffs for more than 509 workers at a cereal manufacture plant in London.[85] The area defined as the Corn Belt covers much of the southwestern area of the province, extending as far north as close to Goderich, but corn and soy are grown throughout the southern portion of the province. Apple orchards are a common sight along the southern shore of Nottawasaga Bay (part of Georgian Bay) near Collingwood and along the northern shore of Lake Ontario near Cobourg. Tobacco production, centred in Norfolk County, has decreased, allowing an increase in alternative crops such as hazelnuts and ginseng. The Ontario origins of Massey Ferguson, once one of the largest farm-implement manufacturers in the world, indicate the importance agriculture once[citation needed] had to the Canadian economy. A sign marking the Ottawa Greenbelt, an initiative to protect farmland and limit urban sprawl Southern Ontario's limited supply of agricultural land is going out of production at an increasing rate. Urban sprawl and farmland severances contribute to the loss of thousands of acres of productive agricultural land in Ontario each year. Over 2,000 farms and 150,000 acres (61,000 ha) of farmland in the GTA alone were lost to production in the two decades between 1976 and 1996. This loss represented approximately 18%"". of Ontario's Class 1 farmland being converted to urban purposes. In addition, increasing rural severances provide ever-greater interference with agricultural production.[86] In an effort to protect the farmland and green spaces of the National Capital Region, and Greater Toronto Area, the Federal[87] and Provincial Governments introduced greenbelts around Ottawa[88] and the Golden Horseshoe, limiting urban development in these areas.[89] Energy[edit] See also: Energy policy of Canada, Renewable energy in Canada, and Smart grid Ontario's rivers make it rich in hydroelectric energy.[90] In 2009, Ontario Power Generation generated 70 percent of the province's electricity, of which 51 percent is nuclear, 39% is hydroelectric and 10% is fossil-fuel derived.[91] By 2025, nuclear power is projected to supply 42%, while fossil-fuel-derived generation is projected to decrease slightly over the next 20 years.[92] Much of the newer power generation coming online in the last few years is natural gas or combined-cycle natural gas plants. OPG is not, however, responsible for the transmission of power, which is under the control of Hydro One. The Pickering Nuclear Generating Station is one of three nuclear power stations in Ontario. Despite its diverse range of power options, problems related to increasing consumption, lack of energy efficiency and aging nuclear reactors, Ontario has been forced in recent years to purchase power from its neighbours Quebec and Michigan to supplement its power needs during peak consumption periods. Ontario's basic domestic rate in 2010 was 11.17 cents per kWh; by contrast. Quebec's was 6.81.[93] In December 2013, the government projected a 42 percent hike by 2018, and 68 percent by 2033.[92] Industrial rates are projected to rise by 33% by 2018, and 55% in 2033.[92] The Green Energy and Green Economy Act, 2009 (GEA), takes a two-pronged approach to commercializing renewable energy; first, it aims to bring more renewable energy sources to the province; and secondly, it aims to adopt more energy-efficiency measures to help conserve energy. The bill envisaged appointing a Renewable Energy Facilitator to provide ""one-window"" assistance and support to project developers to facilitate project approvals.[94] The approvals process for transmission projects would also be streamlined and (for the first time in Ontario) the bill would enact standards for renewable energy projects. Homeowners would have access to incentives to develop small-scale renewables such as low- or no-interest loans to finance the capital cost of renewable energy generating facilities like solar panels.[94] The Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations are hydroelectric plants located in Niagara Falls. Ontario is home to Niagara Falls, which supplies a large amount of electricity to the province. The Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, the largest operational nuclear power plant in the world, is also in Ontario and uses 8 CANDU reactors to generate electricity for the province. Ontario had the most wind energy capacity of the country with 4,900 MW of power (41% of Canada's capacity).[95] Government, law and politics[edit] Further information: Monarchy in Ontario, Executive Council of Ontario, and Local government in Ontario The British North America Act 1867 section 69 stipulated ""There shall be a Legislature for Ontario consisting of the Lieutenant Governor and of One House, styled the Legislative Assembly of Ontario."" The assembly currently has 124 seats (increased from 107 as of the 42nd Ontario general election) representing ridings elected in a first-past-the-post system across the province. The legislative buildings at Queen's Park are the seat of government. Following the Westminster system, the leader of the party holding the most seats in the assembly is known as the ""Premier and President of the Council"" (Executive Council Act R.S.O. 1990). The Premier chooses the cabinet or Executive Council whose members are deemed ministers of the Crown. Although the Legislative Assembly Act (R.S.O. 1990) refers to ""members of the assembly"", the legislators are now commonly called MPPs (Members of the Provincial Parliament) in English and députés de l'Assemblée législative in French, but they have also been called MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly), and both are acceptable. The title of Prime Minister of Ontario, correct in French (le Premier ministre), is permissible in English but now generally avoided in favour of the title ""Premier"" to avoid confusion with the Prime Minister of Canada. Law[edit] Osgoode Hall houses the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the appellate court for the province. Ontario has grown, from its roots in Upper Canada, into a modern jurisdiction. The old titles of the chief law officers, the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, remain in use. They both are responsible to the Legislature. The Attorney-General drafts the laws and is responsible for criminal prosecutions and the administration of justice, while the Solicitor-General is responsible for law enforcement and the police services of the province. The Municipal Act, 2001 (Ontario)[96] is the main statute governing the creation, administration and government of municipalities in the Canadian province of Ontario, other than the City of Toronto. After being passed in 2001, it came into force on January 1, 2003, replacing the previous Municipal Act.[97] Effective January 1, 2007, the Municipal Act, 2001 (the Act) was significantly amended by the Municipal Statute Law Amendment Act, 2006 (Bill 130).[98][99] Politics[edit] Main article: Politics of Ontario The Ontario Legislative Building at Queen's Park. The building serves as the meeting place for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Ontario has numerous political parties which run for election. The four main parties are the centre-right Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, the social democratic Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP), the centre to centre-left Ontario Liberal Party, and Green Party of Ontario. The Progressive Conservatives, Liberals and New Democrats have each governed the province, while the Greens elected their first member to the Legislative Assembly in 2018. The 2018 provincial election resulted in a Progressive Conservative majority government under party leader Doug Ford, who was sworn in as Premier on June 29. Ontario NDP leader Andrea Horwath was sworn in as the leader of her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. Administrative divisions[edit] Map of the counties, regional municipalities, districts, and municipalities of Ontario. Ontario has three types of first-level administrative divisions. They include single-tier municipalities, upper-tier municipalities (which may be in the form of either regional municipalities or counties), and districts. Upper-tier municipalities and districts are made up of smaller municipalities and other types of administrative divisions. Administrative divisions differ primarily in the services that they provide to their residents, with the differing structures of these administrative regions resulting in disparities among Ontario's different regions. The administrative regions of Ontario are roughly coterminous with the census divisions used by Statistics Canada, although some exceptions do exist.[note 2] Urban areas[edit] See also: Golden Horseshoe, National Capital Region (Canada), and Detroit–Windsor Statistics Canada's measure of a ""metro area"", the Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), roughly bundles together population figures from the core municipality with those from ""commuter"" municipalities.[100] CMA (largest other included municipalities in brackets) 2001 2006 2011 2016 % Change Toronto CMA (Mississauga, Brampton) 4,682,897 5,113,149 5,583,064 5,928,040 6.2 Ottawa CMA (Gatineau, Clarence-Rockland) 1,067,800 1,130,761 1,254,919 1,323,783 4.4 Hamilton CMA (Burlington, Grimsby) 662,401 692,911 721,053 747,545 3.7 Kitchener CMA (Cambridge, Waterloo) 414,284 451,235 496,383 523,894 5.5 London CMA (St. Thomas, Strathroy-Caradoc) 435,600 457,720 474,786 494,069 4.1 St. Catharines CMA (Niagara Falls, Welland) 377,009 390,317 392,184 406,074 3.5 Oshawa CMA (Whitby, Clarington) 296,298 330,594 356,177 379,848 6.6 Windsor CMA (Lakeshore, LaSalle) 307,877 323,342 319,246 329,144 3.1 Barrie CMA (Innisfil, Springwater) 148,480 177,061 187,013 197,059 5.4 Sudbury CMA (Whitefish Lake, Wanapitei Reserve) 155,601 158,258 160,770 164,689 1.0 Kingston CMA 146,838 152,358 159,561 161,175 1.0 *Parts of Quebec (including Gatineau) are included in the Ottawa CMA.

Publicly funded elementary and secondary schools are administered by the Ontario Ministry of Education, while colleges and universities are administered by the Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities. The Minister of Education is Stephen Lecce, the Minister of Colleges and Universities is Ross Romano, and the Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development Monte McNaughton. Higher education[edit] Main article: Higher education in Ontario See also: List of colleges in Ontario and List of universities in Ontario Higher education in Ontario includes postsecondary education and skills training regulated by the Ministry of Training, Colleges, and Universities and provided by universities, colleges of applied arts and technology, and private career colleges.[102] The minister is Merrilee Fullerton. The ministry administers laws covering 22 public universities,[103] 24 public colleges (21 Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology (CAATs) and three Institutes of Technology and Advanced Learning (ITALs)),[104] 17 privately funded religious universities,[105] and over 500 private career colleges.[106] The Canadian constitution provides each province with the responsibility for higher education and there is no corresponding national federal ministry of higher education.[107] Within Canadian federalism the division of responsibilities and taxing powers between the Ontario and Canadian governments creates the need for co-operation to fund and deliver higher education to students. Each higher education system aims to improve participation, access, and mobility for students. There are two central organizations that assist with the process of applying to Ontario universities and colleges: the Ontario Universities' Application Centre and Ontario College Application Service. While application services are centralized, admission and selection processes vary and are the purview of each institution. Admission to many Ontario postsecondary institutions can be highly competitive. Upon admission, students may get involved with regional student representation with the Canadian Federation of Students, the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance, or through the College Student Alliance in Ontario. Culture[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (January 2021) In 2019, the government of Ontario passed legislation that established the Poet Laureate of Ontario.[108] Songs and slogans[edit] An Ontario licence plate with the slogan Yours to Discover at the bottom of the plate In 1973, the first slogan to appear on licence plates in Ontario was ""Keep It Beautiful"". This was replaced by ""Yours to Discover"" in 1982,[109] apparently inspired by a tourism slogan, ""Discover Ontario"", dating back to 1927.[110] Plates with the French equivalent, Tant à découvrir, were made available to the public beginning in May 2008.[111] (From 1988 to 1990,[112] ""Ontario Incredible""[113] gave ""Yours to Discover"" a brief respite.) A Place to Stand, a Place to Grow is a song commissioned by the government of Ontario for its pavilion in Expo 67, and an unofficial anthem of the province.[114] As a part of the Canada 150 celebrations in 2017, the provincial government unveiled an ""updated,"" rendition of the song.[114] In 2007, the provincial tourism agency commissioned a new song, ""There's No Place Like This"" is featured in television advertising, performed by Ontario artists including Molly Johnson, Brian Byrne, Keshia Chanté,[115] as well as Tomi Swick and Arkells. Professional sports[edit] The province has professional sports teams in baseball, basketball, Canadian football, ice hockey, lacrosse, rugby league, rugby union and soccer.

Ontario has two major east–west routes, both starting from Montreal in the neighbouring province of Quebec. The northerly route, which was a major fur trade route, travels west from Montreal along the Ottawa River, then continues northwestward towards Manitoba. Major cities on or near the route include Ottawa, North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie, and Thunder Bay. The southerly route, which was driven by growth in settlements originated by the United Empire Loyalists and later other European immigrants, travels southwest from Montreal along the St. Lawrence River, Lake Ontario, and Lake Erie before entering the United States in Michigan. Major cities on or near the route include Kingston, Belleville, Peterborough, Oshawa, Toronto, Mississauga, Kitchener-Waterloo, Hamilton, London, Sarnia, and Windsor. This route was also heavily used by immigrants to the Midwestern US particularly in the late 19th century. Air travel[edit] Thunder Bay International Airport is one of five international airports operating in Ontario. Important airports in the province include Toronto Pearson International Airport, which is the busiest airport in Canada,[116] handling nearly 50 million passengers in 2018.[117] Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport is Ontario's second largest airport. Toronto/Pearson and Ottawa/Macdonald-Cartier form two of the three points in Canada's busiest set of air routes (the third point being Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport). In addition to airports in Ottawa, and Toronto, the province also operates three other international airports, the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport in Hamilton, the Thunder Bay International Airport in Thunder Bay and the London International Airport in London. John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport serves as cargo hub, reliever for Pearson, and a hub for ULCC Swoop. Most Ontario cities have regional airports, many of which have scheduled commuter flights from Air Canada Jazz or smaller airlines and charter companies – flights from the mid-size cities such as Thunder Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury, North Bay, Timmins, Windsor, London, and Kingston feed directly into larger airports in Toronto and Ottawa. Bearskin Airlines also runs flights along the northerly east–west route, connecting Ottawa, North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie, Kitchener and Thunder Bay directly. Isolated towns and settlements in the northern areas of the province rely partly or entirely on air service for travel, goods, and even ambulance services (MEDIVAC), since much of the far northern area of the province cannot be reached by road or rail. Railways[edit] Via Rail operates the inter-regional passenger train service on the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, along with The Canadian, a transcontinental rail service from Southern Ontario to Vancouver, and the Sudbury–White River train. Additionally, Amtrak rail connects Ontario with key New York cities including Buffalo, Albany, and New York City. Ontario Northland provides rail service to destinations as far north as Moosonee near James Bay, connecting them with the south. Freight rail is dominated by the founding cross-country Canadian National Railway and CP Rail companies, which during the 1990s sold many short rail lines from their vast network to private companies operating mostly in the south. Regional commuter rail is limited to the provincially owned GO Transit, and serves a train-bus network spanning the Golden Horseshoe region, with Union Station in Toronto serving as the transport hub.[118][119] There are several city rail-transit systems in the Province. The Toronto Transit Commission operates subways, as well as streetcars (being one of the busiest streetcar systems in North America). OC Transpo operates a light rail metro system in Ottawa.[120] In addition, Waterloo region operates a surface light rail system.[121] Plans to build a light rail line is also underway in the Regional Municipality of Peel.[122][123] Ontario Northland freight train crossing the Missinaibi River at Mattice-Val Côté in Northern Ontario Roads[edit] Main article: Roads in Ontario Highway 400 in Seguin. The roadway forms a part of the province's 400-series highways. 400-series highways make up the primary vehicular network in the south of province, and they connect at a number of points to border crossings to the United States, and Quebec, the busiest being the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel and Ambassador Bridge and the Blue Water Bridge (via Highway 402). Some of the primary highways along the southern route are Highway 401, Highway 417, and Highway 400,[124][125] Highway 401 being the busiest highway in North America. Other provincial highways and regional roads inter-connect the remainder of the province. Waterways[edit] See also: Boat building industry in Ontario The Saint Lawrence Seaway, which extends across most of the southern portion of the province and connects to the Atlantic Ocean, is the primary water transportation route for cargo, particularly iron ore and grain. In the past, the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River were also a major passenger transportation route, but over the past half century passenger travel has been reduced to ferry services and sightseeing cruises. Ontario's three largest ports are the Port of Hamilton, Port of Thunder Bay and the Port of Windsor. Ontario's only saltwater port is located in the town of Moosonee on James Bay.

There would otherwise be 51 census divisions instead of the 49 official ones used by Statistics Canada.

Latin (latīnum, [laˈt̪iːnʊ̃] or lingua latīna, [ˈlɪŋɡʷa laˈt̪iːna]) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. Latin was originally spoken in the area around Rome, known as Latium.[2] Through the power of the Roman Republic, it became the dominant language in Italy, and subsequently throughout the western Roman Empire, before eventually becoming a dead language. Latin has contributed many words to the English language. In particular, Latin (and Ancient Greek) roots are used in English descriptions of theology, the sciences, medicine, and law. By the late Roman Republic (75 BC), Old Latin had been standardised into Classical Latin. Vulgar Latin was the colloquial form spoken at that time and attested in inscriptions and the works of comic playwrights like Plautus and Terence[3] and author Petronius. Late Latin is the written language from the 3rd century; its colloquial form Vulgar Latin developed in the 6th to 9th centuries into the Romance languages, such as Italian, Sardinian, Venetian, Neapolitan, Sicilian, Piedmontese, Lombard, French, Franco-Provençal, Occitan, Corsican, Ladin, Friulan, Romansh, Catalan/Valencian, Aragonese, Spanish, Asturian, Galician, Portuguese and Romanian. Medieval Latin was used as a literary language from the 9th century to the Renaissance which used Renaissance Latin. Later, Early Modern Latin and New Latin evolved. Latin was the language of international communication, scholarship and science until well into the 18th century, when vernaculars (including the Romance languages) supplanted it. Ecclesiastical Latin remains the official language of the Holy See and the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church. Latin is a highly inflected language, with three distinct genders, six or seven noun cases, five declensions, four verb conjugations, six tenses, three persons, three moods, two voices, two or three aspects, and two numbers. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets and ultimately from the Phoenician alphabet.

There are no hard and fast rules of classification; different scholars emphasize different features. As a result, the list has variants, as well as alternative names. In addition to the historical phases, Ecclesiastical Latin refers to the styles used by the writers of the Roman Catholic Church from Late Antiquity onward, as well as by Protestant scholars. After the Western Roman Empire fell in 476 and Germanic kingdoms took its place, the Germanic people adopted Latin as a language more suitable for legal and other, more formal uses.[4] Old Latin[edit] Main article: Old Latin The Lapis Niger, probably the oldest extant Latin inscription, from Rome, c. 600 BC during the semi-legendary Roman Kingdom The earliest known form of Latin is Old Latin, which was spoken from the Roman Kingdom to the later part of the Roman Republic period. It is attested both in inscriptions and in some of the earliest extant Latin literary works, such as the comedies of Plautus and Terence. The Latin alphabet was devised from the Etruscan alphabet. The writing later changed from what was initially either a right-to-left or a boustrophedon[5][6] script to what ultimately became a strictly left-to-right script.[7] Classical Latin[edit] Main article: Classical Latin During the late republic and into the first years of the empire, a new Classical Latin arose, a conscious creation of the orators, poets, historians and other literate men, who wrote the great works of classical literature, which were taught in grammar and rhetoric schools. Today's instructional grammars trace their roots to such schools, which served as a sort of informal language academy dedicated to maintaining and perpetuating educated speech.[8][9] Vulgar Latin[edit] Main articles: Vulgar Latin, Late Latin, and Romance languages Philological analysis of Archaic Latin works, such as those of Plautus, which contain snippets of everyday speech, indicates that a spoken language, Vulgar Latin (termed sermo vulgi, ""the speech of the masses"", by Cicero), existed concurrently with literate Classical Latin. The informal language was rarely written, so philologists have been left with only individual words and phrases cited by classical authors and those found as graffiti.[10] As it was free to develop on its own, there is no reason to suppose that the speech was uniform either diachronically or geographically. On the contrary, romanised European populations developed their own dialects of the language, which eventually led to the differentiation of Romance languages.[11] The decline of the Roman Empire meant a deterioration in educational standards that brought about Late Latin, a postclassical stage of the language seen in Christian writings of the time. It was more in line with everyday speech, not only because of a decline in education but also because of a desire to spread the word to the masses.[citation needed] Despite dialectal variation, which is found in any widespread language, the languages of Spain, France, Portugal, and Italy retained a remarkable unity in phonological forms and developments, bolstered by the stabilising influence of their common Christian (Roman Catholic) culture. It was not until the Moorish conquest of Spain in 711, cutting off communications between the major Romance regions, that the languages began to diverge seriously.[12] The Vulgar Latin dialect that would later become Romanian diverged somewhat more from the other varieties, as it was largely separated from the unifying influences in the western part of the Empire. One key marker of whether a given Romance feature was found in Vulgar Latin is to compare it with its parallel in Classical Latin. If it was not preferred in Classical Latin, then it most likely came from the undocumented contemporaneous Vulgar Latin. For example, the Romance for ""horse"" (Italian cavallo, French cheval, Spanish caballo, Portuguese cavalo and Romanian cal) came from Latin caballus. However, Classical Latin used equus. Therefore, caballus was most likely the spoken form.[13] Vulgar Latin began to diverge into distinct languages by the 9th century at the latest, when the earliest extant Romance writings begin to appear. They were, throughout the period, confined to everyday speech, as Medieval Latin was used for writing.[14][15] Medieval Latin[edit] Main article: Medieval Latin The Latin Malmesbury Bible from 1407. Medieval Latin is the written Latin in use during that portion of the postclassical period when no corresponding Latin vernacular existed. The spoken language had developed into the various incipient Romance languages; however, in the educated and official world, Latin continued without its natural spoken base. Moreover, this Latin spread into lands that had never spoken Latin, such as the Germanic and Slavic nations. It became useful for international communication between the member states of the Holy Roman Empire and its allies. Without the institutions of the Roman empire that had supported its uniformity, medieval Latin lost its linguistic cohesion: for example, in classical Latin sum and eram are used as auxiliary verbs in the perfect and pluperfect passive, which are compound tenses. Medieval Latin might use fui and fueram instead.[16] Furthermore, the meanings of many words have been changed and new vocabularies have been introduced from the vernacular. Identifiable individual styles of classically incorrect Latin prevail.[16] Renaissance Latin[edit] Main article: Renaissance Latin Most 15th-century printed books (incunabula) were in Latin, with the vernacular languages playing only a secondary role.[17] The Renaissance briefly reinforced the position of Latin as a spoken language by its adoption by the Renaissance Humanists. Often led by members of the clergy, they were shocked by the accelerated dismantling of the vestiges of the classical world and the rapid loss of its literature. They strove to preserve what they could and restore Latin to what it had been and introduced the practice of producing revised editions of the literary works that remained by comparing surviving manuscripts. By no later than the 15th century they had replaced Medieval Latin with versions supported by the scholars of the rising universities, who attempted, by scholarship, to discover what the classical language had been.[18][14] New Latin[edit] Main article: New Latin During the Early Modern Age, Latin still was the most important language of culture in Europe. Therefore, until the end of the 17th century the majority of books and almost all diplomatic documents were written in Latin. Afterwards, most diplomatic documents were written in French (a Romance language) and later native or other languages. Contemporary Latin[edit] Main articles: Contemporary Latin and Ecclesiastical Latin Despite having no native speakers, Latin is still used for a variety of purposes in the contemporary world. Religious use[edit] The signs at Wallsend Metro station are in English and Latin, as a tribute to Wallsend's role as one of the outposts of the Roman Empire, as the eastern end of Hadrian's Wall (hence the name) at Segedunum. The largest organisation that retains Latin in official and quasi-official contexts is the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church required that Mass be carried out in Latin until the Second Vatican Council of 1962–1965, which permitted the use of the vernacular. Latin remains the language of the Roman Rite. The Tridentine Mass (also known as the Extraordinary Form or Traditional Latin Mass) is celebrated in Latin. Although the Mass of Paul VI (also known as the Ordinary Form or the Novus Ordo) is usually celebrated in the local vernacular language, it can be and often is said in Latin, in part or in whole, especially at multilingual gatherings. It is the official language of the Holy See, the primary language of its public journal, the Acta Apostolicae Sedis, and the working language of the Roman Rota. Vatican City is also home to the world's only automatic teller machine that gives instructions in Latin.[19] In the pontifical universities postgraduate courses of Canon law are taught in Latin, and papers are written in the same language. In the Anglican Church, after the publication of the Book of Common Prayer of 1559, a Latin edition was published in 1560 for use in universities such as Oxford and the leading ""public schools"" (English private academies), where the liturgy was still permitted to be conducted in Latin.[20] There have been several Latin translations since, including a Latin edition of the 1979 USA Anglican Book of Common Prayer.[21] The polyglot European Union has adopted Latin names in the logos of some of its institutions for the sake of linguistic compromise, an ""ecumenical nationalism"" common to most of the continent and as a sign of the continent's heritage (such as the EU Council: Consilium) Use of Latin for mottos[edit] In the Western world, many organizations, governments and schools use Latin for their mottos due to its association with formality, tradition, and the roots of Western culture.[22] Canada's motto A mari usque ad mare (""from sea to sea"") and most provincial mottos are also in Latin. The Canadian Victoria Cross is modelled after the British Victoria Cross which has the inscription ""For Valour"". Because Canada is officially bilingual, the Canadian medal has replaced the English inscription with the Latin Pro Valore. Spain's motto Plus ultra, meaning ""even further"", or figuratively ""Further!"", is also Latin in origin.[23] It is taken from the personal motto of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain (as Charles I), and is a reversal of the original phrase Non terrae plus ultra (""No land further beyond"", ""No further!""). According to legend, this inscribed as a warning on the Pillars of Hercules, the rocks on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar and the western end of the known, Mediterranean world. Charles adopted the motto following the discovery of the New World by Columbus, and it also has metaphorical suggestions of taking risks and striving for excellence. Several states of the United States have Latin mottos, such as Connecticut's motto Qui transtulit sustinet (""He who transplanted sustains""); Kansas's Ad astra per aspera (""Through hardships, to the stars""); Colorado's Nil sine numine (""Nothing without providence""); Michigan's Si quaeris peninsulam amoenam, circumspice (""If you seek a pleasant peninsula, look about you""), is based on that of Sir Christopher Wren, in St. Paul's Cathedral; Missouri's Salus populi suprema lex esto (""The health of the people should be the highest law""); New York (state)'s Excelsior (""Ever upward""); North Carolina's Esse quam videri (""To be rather than to seem""); South Carolina's Dum spiro spero (""While [still] breathing, I hope""); Virginia's Sic semper tyrannis (""Thus always to tyrants""); and West Virginia's Montani semper liberi (""Mountaineers [are] always free""). Many military organizations today have Latin mottos, such as Semper paratus (""always ready""), the motto of the United States Coast Guard; Semper fidelis (""always faithful""), the motto of the United States Marine Corps; Semper Supra (“always above”), the motto of the United States Space Force; and Per ardua ad astra (""Through adversity/struggle to the stars""), the motto of the Royal Air Force (RAF). Some colleges and universities have adopted Latin mottos, for example Harvard University's motto is Veritas (""truth""). Veritas was the goddess of truth, a daughter of Saturn, and the mother of Virtue. Other modern uses[edit] Switzerland has adopted the country's Latin short name Helvetia on coins and stamps, since there is no room to use all of the nation's four official languages. For a similar reason, it adopted the international vehicle and internet code CH, which stands for Confœderatio Helvetica, the country's full Latin name. Some films of ancient settings, such as Sebastiane and The Passion of the Christ, have been made with dialogue in Latin for the sake of realism. Occasionally, Latin dialogue is used because of its association with religion or philosophy, in such film/television series as The Exorcist and Lost (""Jughead""). Subtitles are usually shown for the benefit of those who do not understand Latin. There are also songs written with Latin lyrics. The libretto for the opera-oratorio Oedipus rex by Igor Stravinsky is in Latin. The continued instruction of Latin is often seen as a highly valuable component of a liberal arts education. Latin is taught at many high schools, especially in Europe and the Americas. It is most common in British public schools and grammar schools, the Italian liceo classico and liceo scientifico, the German Humanistisches Gymnasium and the Dutch gymnasium. Occasionally, some media outlets, targeting enthusiasts, broadcast in Latin. Notable examples include Radio Bremen in Germany, YLE radio in Finland (the Nuntii Latini broadcast from 1989 until it was shut down in June 2019),[24] and Vatican Radio & Television, all of which broadcast news segments and other material in Latin.[25][26][27] A variety of organisations, as well as informal Latin 'circuli' ('circles'), have been founded in more recent times to support the use of spoken Latin.[28] Moreover, a number of university classics departments have began incorporating communicative pedagogies in their Latin courses. These include the University of Kentucky, the University of Oxford and also Princeton University.[29][30][31] There are many websites and forums maintained in Latin by enthusiasts. The Latin Wikipedia has more than 100,000 articles. Legacy[edit] Italian, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Romanian, Catalan, Romansh, and other Romance languages are direct descendants of Latin. There are also many Latin derivatives in English as well as a few in German, Dutch, Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish. Latin is still spoken in Vatican City, a city-state situated in Rome that is the seat of the Catholic Church. Inscriptions[edit] Some inscriptions have been published in an internationally agreed, monumental, multivolume series, the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (CIL). Authors and publishers vary, but the format is about the same: volumes detailing inscriptions with a critical apparatus stating the provenance and relevant information. The reading and interpretation of these inscriptions is the subject matter of the field of epigraphy. About 270,000 inscriptions are known. Literature[edit] Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico is one of the most famous classical Latin texts of the Golden Age of Latin. The unvarnished, journalistic style of this patrician general has long been taught as a model of the urbane Latin officially spoken and written in the floruit of the Roman Republic. The works of several hundred ancient authors who wrote in Latin have survived in whole or in part, in substantial works or in fragments to be analyzed in philology. They are in part the subject matter of the field of classics. Their works were published in manuscript form before the invention of printing and are now published in carefully annotated printed editions, such as the Loeb Classical Library, published by Harvard University Press, or the Oxford Classical Texts, published by Oxford University Press. Latin translations of modern literature such as The Hobbit, Treasure Island, Robinson Crusoe, Paddington Bear, Winnie the Pooh, The Adventures of Tintin, Asterix, Harry Potter, Le Petit Prince, Max and Moritz, How the Grinch Stole Christmas!, The Cat in the Hat, and a book of fairy tales, ""fabulae mirabiles"", are intended to garner popular interest in the language. Additional resources include phrasebooks and resources for rendering everyday phrases and concepts into Latin, such as Meissner's Latin Phrasebook. Influence on present-day languages[edit] The Latin influence in English has been significant at all stages of its insular development. In the Middle Ages, borrowing from Latin occurred from ecclesiastical usage established by Saint Augustine of Canterbury in the 6th century or indirectly after the Norman Conquest, through the Anglo-Norman language. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, English writers cobbled together huge numbers of new words from Latin and Greek words, dubbed ""inkhorn terms"", as if they had spilled from a pot of ink. Many of these words were used once by the author and then forgotten, but some useful ones survived, such as 'imbibe' and 'extrapolate'. Many of the most common polysyllabic English words are of Latin origin through the medium of Old French. Romance words make respectively 59%, 20% and 14% of English, German and Dutch vocabularies.[32][33][34] Those figures can rise dramatically when only non-compound and non-derived words are included. The influence of Roman governance and Roman technology on the less-developed nations under Roman dominion led to the adoption of Latin phraseology in some specialized areas, such as science, technology, medicine, and law. For example, the Linnaean system of plant and animal classification was heavily influenced by Historia Naturalis, an encyclopedia of people, places, plants, animals, and things published by Pliny the Elder. Roman medicine, recorded in the works of such physicians as Galen, established that today's medical terminology would be primarily derived from Latin and Greek words, the Greek being filtered through the Latin. Roman engineering had the same effect on scientific terminology as a whole. Latin law principles have survived partly in a long list of Latin legal terms. A few international auxiliary languages have been heavily influenced by Latin. Interlingua is sometimes considered a simplified, modern version of the language.[dubious – discuss] Latino sine Flexione, popular in the early 20th century, is Latin with its inflections stripped away, among other grammatical changes. The Logudorese dialect of the Sardinian language is the closest contemporary language to Latin.[35] Education[edit] A multivolume Latin dictionary in the University of Graz Library in Austria. Throughout European history, an education in the classics was considered crucial for those who wished to join literate circles. Instruction in Latin is an essential aspect. In today's world, a large number of Latin students in the US learn from Wheelock's Latin: The Classic Introductory Latin Course, Based on Ancient Authors. This book, first published in 1956,[36] was written by Frederic M. Wheelock, who received a PhD from Harvard University. Wheelock's Latin has become the standard text for many American introductory Latin courses. The Living Latin movement attempts to teach Latin in the same way that living languages are taught, as a means of both spoken and written communication. It is available in Vatican City and at some institutions in the US, such as the University of Kentucky and Iowa State University. The British Cambridge University Press is a major supplier of Latin textbooks for all levels, such as the Cambridge Latin Course series. It has also published a subseries of children's texts in Latin by Bell & Forte, which recounts the adventures of a mouse called Minimus. Latin and Ancient Greek at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, 2014. In the United Kingdom, the Classical Association encourages the study of antiquity through various means, such as publications and grants. The University of Cambridge,[37] the Open University,[38] a number of prestigious independent schools, for example Eton, Harrow, Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, Merchant Taylors' School, and Rugby, and The Latin Programme/Via Facilis,[39] a London-based charity, run Latin courses. In the United States and in Canada, the American Classical League supports every effort to further the study of classics. Its subsidiaries include the National Junior Classical League (with more than 50,000 members), which encourages high school students to pursue the study of Latin, and the National Senior Classical League, which encourages students to continue their study of the classics into college. The league also sponsors the National Latin Exam. Classicist Mary Beard wrote in The Times Literary Supplement in 2006 that the reason for learning Latin is because of what was written in it.[40] Official status[edit] Latin was or is the official language of European states: Hungary – Latin was an official language in the Kingdom of Hungary from the 11th century to the mid 19th century, when Hungarian became the exclusive official language in 1844. The best known Latin language poet of Croatian-Hungarian origin was Janus Pannonius. Croatia – Latin was the official language of Croatian Parliament (Sabor) from the 13th to the 19th century (1847). The oldest preserved records of the parliamentary sessions (Congregatio Regni totius Sclavonie generalis) – held in Zagreb (Zagabria), Croatia – date from 19 April 1273. An extensive Croatian Latin literature exists. Latin is still used on Croatian coins on even years.[41] Poland, Kingdom of Poland – officially recognised and widely used[42][43][44][45] between the 10th and 18th centuries, commonly used in foreign relations and popular as a second language among some of the nobility.[45] Phonology[edit] Main article: Latin phonology and orthography The ancient pronunciation of Latin has been reconstructed; among the data used for reconstruction are explicit statements about pronunciation by ancient authors, misspellings, puns, ancient etymologies, the spelling of Latin loanwords in other languages, and the historical development of Romance languages.[46] Consonants[edit] The consonant phonemes of Classical Latin are as follows:[47] Labial Dental Palatal Velar Glottal plain labial Plosive voiced b d ɡ ɡʷ voiceless p t k kʷ Fricative voiced (z) voiceless f s h Nasal m n (ŋ) Rhotic r Approximant l j w /z/ was not native to Classical Latin. It appeared in Greek loanwords starting around the first century BC, when it was probably pronounced [z] initially and doubled [zz] between vowels, in contrast to Classical Greek [dz] or [zd]. In Classical Latin poetry, the letter ⟨z⟩ between vowels always counts as two consonants for metrical purposes.[48][49] The consonant ⟨b⟩ usually sounds as [b]; however, when ⟨t⟩ or ⟨s⟩ precedes ⟨b⟩ then it is pronounced as in [pt] or [ps]. Further, consonants do not blend together. So, ⟨ch⟩, ⟨ph⟩, and ⟨th⟩ are all sounds that would be pronounced as [kh], [ph], and [th]. In Latin, ⟨q⟩ is always followed by the vowel ⟨u⟩. Together they make a [kw] sound.[50] In Old and Classical Latin, the Latin alphabet had no distinction between uppercase and lowercase, and the letters ⟨J U W⟩ did not exist. In place of ⟨J U⟩, ⟨I V⟩ were used, respectively; ⟨I V⟩ represented both vowels and consonants. Most of the letterforms were similar to modern uppercase, as can be seen in the inscription from the Colosseum shown at the top of the article. The spelling systems used in Latin dictionaries and modern editions of Latin texts, however, normally use ⟨j u⟩ in place of Classical-era ⟨i v⟩. Some systems use ⟨j v⟩ for the consonant sounds /j w/ except in the combinations ⟨gu su qu⟩ for which ⟨v⟩ is never used. Some notes concerning the mapping of Latin phonemes to English graphemes are given below: Notes Latingrapheme Latinphoneme English examples ⟨c⟩, ⟨k⟩ [k] Always as k in sky (/skaɪ/) ⟨t⟩ [t] As t in stay (/steɪ/) ⟨s⟩ [s] As s in say (/seɪ/) ⟨g⟩ [ɡ] Always as g in good (/ɡʊd/) [ŋ] Before ⟨n⟩, as ng in sing (/sɪŋ/) ⟨n⟩ [n] As n in man (/mæn/) [ŋ] Before ⟨c⟩, ⟨x⟩, and ⟨g⟩, as ng in sing (/sɪŋ/) ⟨l⟩ [l] When doubled ⟨ll⟩ and before ⟨i⟩, as ""light L"", [l̥] in link ([l̥ɪnk]) (l exilis)[51][52] [ɫ] In all other positions, as ""dark L"", [ɫ] in bowl ([boʊɫ]) (l pinguis) ⟨qu⟩ [kʷ] Similar to qu in quick (/kwɪk/) ⟨u⟩ [w] Sometimes at the beginning of a syllable, or after ⟨g⟩ and ⟨s⟩, as /w/ in wine (/waɪn/) ⟨i⟩ [j] Sometimes at the beginning of a syllable, as y (/j/) in yard (/jaɹd/) [ij] ""y"" (/j/), in between vowels, becomes ""i-y"", being pronounced as parts of two separate syllables, as in capiō (/kapiˈjo:/) ⟨x⟩ [ks] A letter representing ⟨c⟩ + ⟨s⟩: as x in English axe (/æks/) In Classical Latin, as in modern Italian, double consonant letters were pronounced as long consonant sounds distinct from short versions of the same consonants. Thus the nn in Classical Latin annus ""year"" (and in Italian anno) is pronounced as a doubled /nn/ as in English unnamed. (In English, distinctive consonant length or doubling occurs only at the boundary between two words or morphemes, as in that example.) Vowels[edit] Simple vowels[edit] Front Central Back Close iː ɪ ʊ uː Mid eː ɛ ɔ oː Open a aː In Classical Latin, ⟨U⟩ did not exist as a letter distinct from V; the written form ⟨V⟩ was used to represent both a vowel and a consonant. ⟨Y⟩ was adopted to represent upsilon in loanwords from Greek, but it was pronounced like ⟨u⟩ and ⟨i⟩ by some speakers. It was also used in native Latin words by confusion with Greek words of similar meaning, such as sylva and ὕλη. Classical Latin distinguished between long and short vowels. Then, long vowels, except for ⟨I⟩, were frequently marked using the apex, which was sometimes similar to an acute accent ⟨Á É Ó V́ Ý⟩. Long /iː/ was written using a taller version of ⟨I⟩, called i longa ""long I"": ⟨ꟾ⟩. In modern texts, long vowels are often indicated by a macron ⟨ā ē ī ō ū⟩, and short vowels are usually unmarked except when it is necessary to distinguish between words, when they are marked with a breve ⟨ă ĕ ĭ ŏ ŭ⟩. However, they would also signify a long vowel by writing the vowel larger than other letters in a word or by repeating the vowel twice in a row.[50] The acute accent, when it is used in modern Latin texts, indicates stress, as in Spanish, rather than length. Long vowels in Classical Latin are, technically, pronounced as entirely different from short vowels. The difference is described in the table below: Pronunciation of Latin vowels Latingrapheme Latinphone modern examples ⟨a⟩ [a] similar to the last a in part (/paɹt/) [aː] similar to a in father (/fɑːðəɹ/) ⟨e⟩ [ɛ] as e in pet (/pɛt/) [eː] similar to e in hey (/heɪ/) ⟨i⟩ [ɪ] as i in pit (/pɪt/) [iː] similar to i in machine (/məʃiːn/) ⟨o⟩ [ɔ] as o in port (/pɔɹt/) [oː] similar to o in post (/poʊst/) ⟨u⟩ [ʊ] as u in put (/pʊt/) [uː] similar to ue in true (/tɹuː/) ⟨y⟩ [ʏ] does not exist in English; as ü in German Stück (/ʃtʏk/) [yː] does not exist in English; as üh in German früh (/fʀyː/) This difference in quality is posited by W. Sidney Allen in his book Vox Latina. However, Andrea Calabrese has disputed that short vowels differed in quality from long vowels, based upon the observation that [ɪ] and [ʊ] do not exist even in very conservative Romance languages such as Sardinian, with the difference in vowel quality more associated with Germanic languages. A vowel letter followed by ⟨m⟩ at the end of a word, or a vowel letter followed by ⟨n⟩ before ⟨s⟩ or ⟨f⟩, represented a long nasal vowel, as in monstrum [mõːstrũː]. Diphthongs[edit] Classical Latin had several diphthongs. The two most common were ⟨ae au⟩. ⟨oe⟩ was fairly rare, and ⟨ui eu ei⟩ were very rare, at least in native Latin words.[53] There has also been debate over whether ⟨ui⟩ is truly a diphthong in Classical Latin, due to its rarity, absence in works of Roman grammarians, and the roots of Classical Latin words (i.e. hui ce to huic, quoi to cui, etc.) not matching or being similar to the pronunciation of classical words if ⟨ui⟩ were to be considered a diphthong.[54] The sequences sometimes did not represent diphthongs. ⟨ae⟩ and ⟨oe⟩ also represented a sequence of two vowels in different syllables in aēnus [aˈeː.nʊs] ""of bronze"" and coēpit [kɔˈeː.pɪt] ""began"", and ⟨au ui eu ei ou⟩ represented sequences of two vowels or of a vowel and one of the semivowels /j w/, in cavē [ˈka.weː] ""beware!"", cuius [ˈkʊj.jʊs] ""whose"", monuī [ˈmɔn.ʊ.iː] ""I warned"", solvī [ˈsɔɫ.wiː] ""I released"", dēlēvī [deːˈleː.wiː] ""I destroyed"", eius [ˈɛj.jʊs] ""his"", and novus [ˈnɔ.wʊs] ""new"". Old Latin had more diphthongs, but most of them changed into long vowels in Classical Latin. The Old Latin diphthong ⟨ai⟩ and the sequence ⟨āī⟩ became Classical ⟨ae⟩. Old Latin ⟨oi⟩ and ⟨ou⟩ changed to Classical ⟨ū⟩, except in a few words whose ⟨oi⟩ became Classical ⟨oe⟩. These two developments sometimes occurred in different words from the same root: for instance, Classical poena ""punishment"" and pūnīre ""to punish"".[53] Early Old Latin ⟨ei⟩ usually changed to Classical ⟨ī⟩.[55] In Vulgar Latin and the Romance languages, ⟨ae oe⟩ merged with ⟨e ē⟩. During the Classical Latin period this form of speaking was deliberately avoided by well-educated speakers.[53] Diphthongs classified by beginning sound Front Back Close ui /ui̯/ Mid ei /ei̯/eu/eu̯/ oe /oe̯/ou /ou̯/ Open ae /ae̯/au /au̯/ Syllables[edit] Syllables in Latin are signified by the presence of diphthongs and vowels. The number of syllables is the same as the number of vowel sounds.[50] Further, if a consonant separates two vowels, it will go into the syllable of the second vowel. When there are two consonants between vowels, the last consonant will go with the second vowel. An exception occurs when a phonetic stop and liquid come together. In this situation, they are thought to be a single consonant, and as such, they will go into the syllable of the second vowel.[50] Length[edit] Syllables in Latin are considered either long or short. Within a word, a syllable may either be long by nature or long by position.[50] A syllable is long by nature if it has a diphthong or a long vowel. On the other hand, a syllable is long by position if the vowel is followed by more than one consonant.[50] Stress[edit] There are two rules that define which syllable is stressed in the Latin language.[50] In a word with only two syllables, the emphasis will be on the first syllable. In a word with more than two syllables, there are two cases. If the second-to-last syllable is long, that syllable will have stress. If the second-to-last syllable is not long, the syllable before that one will be stressed instead.[50] Orthography[edit] Main article: Latin alphabet The Duenos Inscription, from the 6th century BC, is one of the earliest known Old Latin texts. It was found on the Quirinal Hill in Rome. Latin was written in the Latin alphabet, derived from the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn drawn from the Greek alphabet and ultimately the Phoenician alphabet.[56] This alphabet has continued to be used over the centuries as the script for the Romance, Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, Finnic, and many Slavic languages (Polish, Slovak, Slovene, Croatian, Bosnian and Czech); and it has been adopted by many languages around the world, including Vietnamese, the Austronesian languages, many Turkic languages, and most languages in sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, and Oceania, making it by far the world's single most widely used writing system. The number of letters in the Latin alphabet has varied. When it was first derived from the Etruscan alphabet, it contained only 21 letters.[57] Later, G was added to represent /ɡ/, which had previously been spelled C, and Z ceased to be included in the alphabet, as the language then had no voiced alveolar fricative.[58] The letters Y and Z were later added to represent Greek letters, upsilon and zeta respectively, in Greek loanwords.[58] W was created in the 11th century from VV. It represented /w/ in Germanic languages, not Latin, which still uses V for the purpose. J was distinguished from the original I only during the late Middle Ages, as was the letter U from V.[58] Although some Latin dictionaries use J, it is rarely used for Latin text, as it was not used in classical times, but many other languages use it. Classical Latin did not contain sentence punctuation, letter case,[59] or interword spacing, but apices were sometimes used to distinguish length in vowels and the interpunct was used at times to separate words. The first line of Catullus 3, originally written as lv́géteóveneréscupꟾdinésqve (""Mourn, O Venuses and Cupids"") or with interpunct as lv́géte·ó·venerés·cupꟾdinésqve would be rendered in a modern edition as Lugete, o Veneres Cupidinesque or with macrons Lūgēte, ō Venerēs Cupīdinēsque or with apices Lúgéte, ó Venerés Cupídinésque. A modern Latin text written in the Old Roman Cursive inspired by the Vindolanda tablets, the oldest surviving handwritten documents in Britain. The word Romani ('Romans') is at bottom left. The Roman cursive script is commonly found on the many wax tablets excavated at sites such as forts, an especially extensive set having been discovered at Vindolanda on Hadrian's Wall in Britain. Most notable is the fact that while most of the Vindolanda tablets show spaces between words, spaces were avoided in monumental inscriptions from that era. Alternative scripts[edit] Occasionally, Latin has been written in other scripts: The Praeneste fibula is a 7th-century BC pin with an Old Latin inscription written using the Etruscan script. The rear panel of the early 8th-century Franks Casket has an inscription that switches from Old English in Anglo-Saxon runes to Latin in Latin script and to Latin in runes. Grammar[edit] Main articles: Latin grammar and Latin syntax Latin is a synthetic, fusional language in the terminology of linguistic typology. In more traditional terminology, it is an inflected language, but typologists are apt to say ""inflecting"". Words include an objective semantic element and markers specifying the grammatical use of the word. The fusion of root meaning and markers produces very compact sentence elements: amō, ""I love,"" is produced from a semantic element, ama-, ""love,"" to which -ō, a first person singular marker, is suffixed. The grammatical function can be changed by changing the markers: the word is ""inflected"" to express different grammatical functions, but the semantic element usually does not change. (Inflection uses affixing and infixing. Affixing is prefixing and suffixing. Latin inflections are never prefixed.) For example, amābit, ""he (or she or it) will love"", is formed from the same stem, amā-, to which a future tense marker, -bi-, is suffixed, and a third person singular marker, -t, is suffixed. There is an inherent ambiguity: -t may denote more than one grammatical category: masculine, feminine, or neuter gender. A major task in understanding Latin phrases and clauses is to clarify such ambiguities by an analysis of context. All natural languages contain ambiguities of one sort or another. The inflections express gender, number, and case in adjectives, nouns, and pronouns, a process called declension. Markers are also attached to fixed stems of verbs, to denote person, number, tense, voice, mood, and aspect, a process called conjugation. Some words are uninflected and undergo neither process, such as adverbs, prepositions, and interjections. Nouns[edit] Main article: Latin declension A regular Latin noun belongs to one of five main declensions, a group of nouns with similar inflected forms. The declensions are identified by the genitive singular form of the noun. The first declension, with a predominant ending letter of a, is signified by the genitive singular ending of -ae. The second declension, with a predominant ending letter of us, is signified by the genitive singular ending of -i. The third declension, with a predominant ending letter of i, is signified by the genitive singular ending of -is. The fourth declension, with a predominant ending letter of u, is signified by the genitive singular ending of -ūs. The fifth declension, with a predominant ending letter of e, is signified by the genitive singular ending of -ei. There are seven Latin noun cases, which also apply to adjectives and pronouns and mark a noun's syntactic role in the sentence by means of inflections. Thus, word order is not as important in Latin as it is in English, which is less inflected. The general structure and word order of a Latin sentence can therefore vary. The cases are as follows: Nominative – used when the noun is the subject or a predicate nominative. The thing or person acting: the girl ran: puella cucurrit, or cucurrit puella Genitive – used when the noun is the possessor of or connected with an object: ""the horse of the man"", or ""the man's horse""; in both instances, the word man would be in the genitive case when it is translated into Latin. It also indicates the partitive, in which the material is quantified: ""a group of people""; ""a number of gifts"": people and gifts would be in the genitive case. Some nouns are genitive with special verbs and adjectives: The cup is full of wine. (Poculum plēnum vīnī est.) The master of the slave had beaten him. (Dominus servī eum verberāverat.) Dative – used when the noun is the indirect object of the sentence, with special verbs, with certain prepositions, and if it is used as agent, reference, or even possessor: The merchant hands the stola to the woman. (Mercātor fēminae stolam trādit.) Accusative – used when the noun is the direct object of the subject and as the object of a preposition demonstrating place to which.: The man killed the boy. (Vir puerum necāvit.) Ablative – used when the noun demonstrates separation or movement from a source, cause, agent or instrument or when the noun is used as the object of certain prepositions; adverbial: You walked with the boy. (Cum puerō ambulāvistī.) Vocative – used when the noun is used in a direct address. The vocative form of a noun is often the same as the nominative, with the exception of second-declension nouns ending in -us. The -us becomes an -e in the vocative singular. If it ends in -ius (such as fīlius), the ending is just -ī (filī), as distinct from the nominative plural (filiī) in the vocative singular: ""Master!"" shouted the slave. (""Domine!"" clāmāvit servus.) Locative – used to indicate a location (corresponding to the English ""in"" or ""at""). It is far less common than the other six cases of Latin nouns and usually applies to cities and small towns and islands along with a few common nouns, such as the words domus (house), humus (ground), and rus (country). In the singular of the first and second declensions, its form coincides with the genitive (Roma becomes Romae, ""in Rome""). In the plural of all declensions and the singular of the other declensions, it coincides with the ablative (Athēnae becomes Athēnīs, ""at Athens""). In the fourth-declension word domus, the locative form, domī (""at home"") differs from the standard form of all other cases. Latin lacks both definite and indefinite articles so puer currit can mean either ""the boy is running"" or ""a boy is running"". Adjectives[edit] Main article: Latin declension § Adjectives There are two types of regular Latin adjectives: first- and second-declension and third-declension. They are so-called because their forms are similar or identical to first- and second-declension and third-declension nouns, respectively. Latin adjectives also have comparative and superlative forms. There are also a number of Latin participles. Latin numbers are sometimes declined as adjectives. See Numbers below. First- and second-declension adjectives are declined like first-declension nouns for the feminine forms and like second-declension nouns for the masculine and neuter forms. For example, for mortuus, mortua, mortuum (dead), mortua is declined like a regular first-declension noun (such as puella (girl)), mortuus is declined like a regular second-declension masculine noun (such as dominus (lord, master)), and mortuum is declined like a regular second-declension neuter noun (such as auxilium (help)). Third-declension adjectives are mostly declined like normal third-declension nouns, with a few exceptions. In the plural nominative neuter, for example, the ending is -ia (omnia (all, everything)), and for third-declension nouns, the plural nominative neuter ending is -a or -ia (capita (heads), animalia (animals)) They can have one, two or three forms for the masculine, feminine, and neuter nominative singular. Participles[edit] Latin participles, like English participles, are formed from a verb. There are a few main types of participles: Present Active Participles, Perfect Passive Participles, Future Active Participles, and Future Passive Participles. Prepositions[edit] Latin sometimes uses prepositions, depending on the type of prepositional phrase being used. Most prepositions are followed by a noun in either the accusative or ablative case: ""apud puerum"" (with the boy), with ""puerum"" being the accusative form of ""puer"", boy, and ""sine puero"" (without the boy, ""puero"" being the ablative form of ""puer"". A few adpositions, however, govern a noun in the genitive (such as ""gratia"" and ""tenus""). Verbs[edit] Main articles: Latin grammar and Latin conjugation A regular verb in Latin belongs to one of four main conjugations. A conjugation is ""a class of verbs with similar inflected forms.""[60] The conjugations are identified by the last letter of the verb's present stem. The present stem can be found by omitting the -re (-rī in deponent verbs) ending from the present infinitive form. The infinitive of the first conjugation ends in -ā-re or -ā-ri (active and passive respectively): amāre, ""to love,"" hortārī, ""to exhort""; of the second conjugation by -ē-re or -ē-rī: monēre, ""to warn"", verērī, ""to fear;"" of the third conjugation by -ere, -ī: dūcere, ""to lead,"" ūtī, ""to use""; of the fourth by -ī-re, -ī-rī: audīre, ""to hear,"" experīrī, ""to attempt"".[61] The stem categories descend from Indo-European and can therefore be compared to similar conjugations in other Indo-European languages. Irregular verbs are verbs that do not follow the regular conjugations in the formation of the inflected form. Irregular verbs in Latin are esse, ""to be""; velle, ""to want""; ferre, ""to carry""; edere, ""to eat""; dare, ""to give""; ire, ""to go""; quire, ""to be able""; fieri, ""to happen""; and their compounds.[61] There are six general tenses in Latin (present, imperfect, future, perfect, pluperfect and future perfect), three moods (indicative, imperative and subjunctive, in addition to the infinitive, participle, gerund, gerundive and supine), three persons (first, second and third), two numbers (singular and plural), two voices (active and passive) and two aspects (perfective and imperfective). Verbs are described by four principal parts: The first principal part is the first-person singular, present tense, active voice, indicative mood form of the verb. If the verb is impersonal, the first principal part will be in the third-person singular. The second principal part is the present active infinitive. The third principal part is the first-person singular, perfect active indicative form. Like the first principal part, if the verb is impersonal, the third principal part will be in the third-person singular. The fourth principal part is the supine form, or alternatively, the nominative singular of the perfect passive participle form of the verb. The fourth principal part can show one gender of the participle or all three genders (-us for masculine, -a for feminine and -um for neuter) in the nominative singular. The fourth principal part will be the future participle if the verb cannot be made passive. Most modern Latin dictionaries, if they show only one gender, tend to show the masculine; but many older dictionaries instead show the neuter, as it coincides with the supine. The fourth principal part is sometimes omitted for intransitive verbs, but strictly in Latin, they can be made passive if they are used impersonally, and the supine exists for such verbs. The six tenses of Latin are divided into two tense systems: the present system, which is made up of the present, imperfect and future tenses, and the perfect system, which is made up of the perfect, pluperfect and future perfect tenses. Each tense has a set of endings corresponding to the person, number, and voice of the subject. Subject (nominative) pronouns are generally omitted for the first (I, we) and second (you) persons except for emphasis. The table below displays the common inflected endings for the indicative mood in the active voice in all six tenses. For the future tense, the first listed endings are for the first and second conjugations, and the second listed endings are for the third and fourth conjugations: Tense Singular Plural 1st Person 2nd Person 3rd Person 1st Person 2nd Person 3rd Person Present -ō/m -s -t -mus -tis -nt Future -bō, -am -bis, -ēs -bit, -et -bimus, -ēmus -bitis, -ētis -bunt, -ent Imperfect -bam -bās -bat -bāmus -bātis -bant Perfect -ī -istī -it -imus -istis -ērunt Future Perfect -erō -eris/erīs -erit -erimus/-erīmus -eritis/-erītis -erint Pluperfect -eram -erās -erat -erāmus -erātis -erant Deponent verbs[edit] Some Latin verbs are deponent, causing their forms to be in the passive voice but retain an active meaning: hortor, hortārī, hortātus sum (to urge). Vocabulary[edit] As Latin is an Italic language, most of its vocabulary is likewise Italic, ultimately from the ancestral Proto-Indo-European language. However, because of close cultural interaction, the Romans not only adapted the Etruscan alphabet to form the Latin alphabet but also borrowed some Etruscan words into their language, including persona ""mask"" and histrio ""actor"".[62] Latin also included vocabulary borrowed from Oscan, another Italic language. After the Fall of Tarentum (272 BC), the Romans began Hellenising, or adopting features of Greek culture, including the borrowing of Greek words, such as camera (vaulted roof), sumbolum (symbol), and balineum (bath).[62] This Hellenisation led to the addition of ""Y"" and ""Z"" to the alphabet to represent Greek sounds.[63] Subsequently, the Romans transplanted Greek art, medicine, science and philosophy to Italy, paying almost any price to entice Greek skilled and educated persons to Rome and sending their youth to be educated in Greece. Thus, many Latin scientific and philosophical words were Greek loanwords or had their meanings expanded by association with Greek words, as ars (craft) and τέχνη (art).[64] Because of the Roman Empire's expansion and subsequent trade with outlying European tribes, the Romans borrowed some northern and central European words, such as beber (beaver), of Germanic origin, and bracae (breeches), of Celtic origin.[64] The specific dialects of Latin across Latin-speaking regions of the former Roman Empire after its fall were influenced by languages specific to the regions. The dialects of Latin evolved into different Romance languages. During and after the adoption of Christianity into Roman society, Christian vocabulary became a part of the language, either from Greek or Hebrew borrowings or as Latin neologisms.[65] Continuing into the Middle Ages, Latin incorporated many more words from surrounding languages, including Old English and other Germanic languages. Over the ages, Latin-speaking populations produced new adjectives, nouns, and verbs by affixing or compounding meaningful segments.[66] For example, the compound adjective, omnipotens, ""all-powerful,"" was produced from the adjectives omnis, ""all"", and potens, ""powerful"", by dropping the final s of omnis and concatenating. Often, the concatenation changed the part of speech, and nouns were produced from verb segments or verbs from nouns and adjectives.[67] Phrases (Neo-Latin)[edit] Main article: List of Latin phrases The phrases are mentioned with accents to show where stress is placed.[68] In Latin, words are normally stressed either on the second-to-last (penultimate) syllable, called in Latin paenultima or syllaba paenultima,[69] or on the third-to-last syllable, called in Latin antepaenultima or syllaba antepaenultima.[69] In the following notation, accented short vowels have an acute diacritic, accented long vowels have a circumflex diacritic (representing long falling pitch), and unaccented long vowels are marked simply with a macron. This reflects the tone of the voice with which, ideally, the stress is phonetically realized; but this may not always be clearly articulated on every word in a sentence.[70] Regardless of length, a vowel at the end of a word may be significantly shortened or even altogether deleted if the next word begins with a vowel also (a process called elision), unless a very short pause is inserted. As an exception, the following words: est (English ""is""), es (""[you (sg.)] are"") lose their own vowel e instead. sálvē to one person / salvête to more than one person – hello ávē to one person / avête to more than one person – greetings válē to one person / valête to more than one person – goodbye cûrā ut váleās – take care exoptâtus to male / exoptâta to female, optâtus to male / optâta to female, grâtus to male / grâta to female, accéptus to male / accépta to female – welcome quômodo válēs?, ut válēs? – how are you? béne – good béne váleō – I'm fine mále – bad mále váleō – I'm not good quaêsō (roughly: ['kwaeso:]/['kwe:so:]) – please amâbō tē – please íta, íta est, íta vêrō, sîc, sîc est, étiam – yes nôn, mínimē – no grâtiās tíbi, grâtiās tíbi ágō – thank you, I give thanks to you mágnās grâtiās, mágnās grâtiās ágō – many thanks máximās grâtiās, máximās grâtiās ágō, ingéntēs grâtiās ágō – thank you very much áccipe sīs to one person / accípite sîtis to more than one person, libénter – you're welcome quā aetâte es? – how old are you? 25 (vīgíntī quînque) ánnōs nâtus sumby male /25 ánnōs nâta sum by female – I am 25 years old úbi lātrîna est? – where is the toilet? scîs (tū) ... – do you speak (literally: ""do you know"") ...

Today, the numbers can be written with the Arabic numbers as well as with Roman numerals. The numbers 1, 2 and 3 and every whole hundred from 200 to 900 are declined as nouns and adjectives, with some differences. ūnus, ūna, ūnum (masculine, feminine, neuter) I one duo, duae, duo (m., f., n.) II two trēs, tria (m./f., n.) III three quattuor IIII or IV four quīnque V five sex VI six septem VII seven octō VIII eight novem VIIII or IX nine decem X ten quīnquāgintā L fifty centum C one hundred quīngentī, quīngentae, quīngenta (m., f., n.) D five hundred mīlle M one thousand The numbers from 4 to 100 do not change their endings. As in modern descendants such as Spanish, the gender for naming a number in isolation is masculine, so that ""1, 2, 3"" is counted as ūnus, duo, trēs. Example text[edit] Commentarii de Bello Gallico, also called De Bello Gallico (The Gallic War), written by Gaius Julius Caesar, begins with the following passage: Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres, quarum unam incolunt Belgae, aliam Aquitani, tertiam qui ipsorum lingua Celtae, nostra Galli appellantur. Hi omnes lingua, institutis, legibus inter se differunt. Gallos ab Aquitanis Garumna flumen, a Belgis Matrona et Sequana dividit. Horum omnium fortissimi sunt Belgae, propterea quod a cultu atque humanitate provinciae longissime absunt, minimeque ad eos mercatores saepe commeant atque ea quae ad effeminandos animos pertinent important, proximique sunt Germanis, qui trans Rhenum incolunt, quibuscum continenter bellum gerunt. Qua de causa Helvetii quoque reliquos Gallos virtute praecedunt, quod fere cotidianis proeliis cum Germanis contendunt, cum aut suis finibus eos prohibent aut ipsi in eorum finibus bellum gerunt. Eorum una pars, quam Gallos obtinere dictum est, initium capit a flumine Rhodano, continetur Garumna flumine, Oceano, finibus Belgarum; attingit etiam ab Sequanis et Helvetiis flumen Rhenum; vergit ad septentriones. Belgae ab extremis Galliae finibus oriuntur; pertinent ad inferiorem partem fluminis Rheni; spectant in septentrionem et orientem solem. Aquitania a Garumna flumine ad Pyrenaeos montes et eam partem Oceani quae est ad Hispaniam pertinet; spectat inter occasum solis et septentriones. The same text may be marked for all long vowels (before any possible elisions at word boundary) with apices over vowel letters, including customarily before ""nf"" and ""ns"" where a long vowel is automatically produced: Gallia est omnis dívísa in partés trés, quárum únam incolunt Belgae, aliam Aquítání, tertiam quí ipsórum linguá Celtae, nostrá Gallí appellantur. Hí omnés linguá, ínstitútís, légibus inter sé differunt. Gallós ab Aquítánís Garumna flúmen, á Belgís Mátrona et Séquana dívidit. Hórum omnium fortissimí sunt Belgae, proptereá quod á cultú atque húmánitáte próvinciae longissimé absunt, miniméque ad eós mercátórés saepe commeant atque ea quae ad efféminandós animós pertinent important, proximíque sunt Germánís, quí tráns Rhénum incolunt, quibuscum continenter bellum gerunt. Quá dé causá Helvétií quoque reliquós Gallós virtúte praecédunt, quod feré cotídiánís proeliís cum Germánís contendunt, cum aut suís fínibus eós prohibent aut ipsí in eórum fínibus bellum gerunt. Eórum úna pars, quam Gallós obtinére dictum est, initium capit á flúmine Rhodanó, continétur Garumná flúmine, Óceanó, fínibus Belgárum; attingit etiam ab Séquanís et Helvétiís flúmen Rhénum; vergit ad septentriónés. Belgae ab extrémís Galliae fínibus oriuntur; pertinent ad ínferiórem partem flúminis Rhéní; spectant in septentriónem et orientem sólem. Aquítánia á Garumná flúmine ad Pýrénaeós montés et eam partem Óceaní quae est ad Hispániam pertinet; spectat inter occásum sólis et septentriónés.

Environment & Energy May 29: Young Energy Specialists for Development Cooperation (YES-DC) Biannual Debate on Energy; Utrecht, NetherlandsMay 18, 2010, 4:00 AMThe general topic of one-day YES-DC event is “How can modern energy for developing countries be financed?” The focus will be on how to support the introduction of modern energy services in developing countries as a part of international climate change activities. Between the Copenhagen and the Mexico conferences on climate change, it is a good moment for energy professionals to obtain an overview of what is happening, which opportunities are arising, and what innovative approaches are emerging.http://www.yes-dc.org/ To read the full article log in.

"About Us NW Skip to content Home Events Network News About us Become a Member Menu Home Events Network News About us Become a Member About Us ABOUT YES-DC Young Energy Specialists and Development Co-operation (YES-DC) is an association of students and young professionals interested and/or working in the field of energy and development co-operation. YES-DC was found in October 1994, as a means to create a network and to facilitate the exchange of information and experiences. Since March 1996, YES-DC has officially been established as an association. YES-DC HISTORY On 15th October 1994, over twenty-five enthusiastic young professionals came together to discuss the future of energy. In the 1990’s, before the internet and social media, the need arose for a discussion platform to share knowledge and ideas. On 28th January 28 1995, a second meeting was organised, and Young Energy Specialists and Development Co-operation (YES-DC) was officially founded. Since the beginning, the focus has been on both the Dutch energy system, and energy systems in developing countries. In the mid 2000’s, as the general thought was that the Dutch energy system was ‘finished’, the focus was increasingly laid on how we could help developing countries in their future energy needs.However, as the impact of climate change was becoming more visible, the focus shifted back towards the Dutch energy system. How can we work towards a sustainable energy system, running on renewable energy sources? Many, many aspects of this complex issue have been discussed over the last years.Throughout its history, YES-DC has been organising sessions to deepen our understanding of the challenges we face, and the solutions that are out there. The focus has mostly been a technical one, although also more ‘soft aspects’ around implementation have been discussed over the last years. YES-DC still organises several sessions every year. YES-DC MISSION ENGAGING YOUNG PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY, AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH KNOWLEDGE SHARING, NETWORKING AND COMMUNITY BUILDING. YES-DC MEMBERS The members of YES-DC are young professionals and students in the field of energy and/or sustainability. They work within local and international companies, government bodies, universities, research institutions, and NGOs. The board of YES-DC are honorary members, which besides their professional occupations takes care of the organisational and financial framework, and organises these knowledge-sharing and networking opportunities, considering the valuable input from its members along the way. The YES-DC Alumni are former board members, which gather once a year and are still part of the organization’s community. YES-DC Board Ligin Thomas President/Chairman “You think energy is a secondary problem. But think about it: almost all of today’s most basic problems like hunger and poverty are tied to energy. So you solve the problem of energy; you solve half of the world’s problems.”This particular quote from my professor Dr P.V Bhale during my bachelors was the spark to my desire to become energy professional. I have been acquainted with the complexity of solving the energy problem ever since I started my career in the oil and gas industry, several projects on offshore wind turbines and my latest work going on in the hydrogen transport infrastructure.My goal as a chairman/president of YES-DC is to work along with the board of 2021-2022 to strengthen our network, expand its reach and enable our members to reach their full potential in contributing to the energy transition. Linkedin Mrinal Abhinav Treasurer I believe that energy is the key contribution to financial development and there is a nearby connection between the accessibility of energy and the development of a country. YES-DC is the perfect platform to bridge that gap and share knowledge from different people on exciting topics. It would be a great opportunity for me to understand the prospect of the energy industry better and gain a well-rounded insight by networking with people. Linkedin Rene van der Velden Secretary To effectively and fairly shape the energy transition, young energy professionals need to keep learning from each other by sharing experiences and perspectives. I’m happy to be actively involved in stimulating the dialogue between the professionals currently tackling this challenge. With a background in international development, I see the differences and similarities of the energy transition in the global south and north. At YES-DC, I hope to link up these different perspectives so they will benefit from each other. I’m excited to organise effective events where people meet, grow their network, and learn.​ Linkedin Jier Nzuanzu Content Manager With the experience of studying and creating algorithms, I think I can do more than do my everyday job. Therefore, I choose to act actively, hoping that others in my field realise that we can do more. I am grateful to be a new board member, and I hope to learn and broaden my perspective about sustainability.In my term, I will focus my attention on the internal relations and the digital presence of YES-DC. With my help, I hope, together with the rest of the board, to create meaningful connections and engaging events.​ Linkedin Iva Tsvetkova Community Manager Being an active member in a few energy-related networks made me join YES-DC as a board member this year. After receiving so much in the form of valuable knowledge, connections and experience – it was my turn to give back to our community now. That’s why my focus is on growing and sustaining a diverse and collaborative community of energy professionals and students who aspire to follow their steps. Through my educational background, I gained knowledge on the energy transition from a business perspective. More particularly, on energy innovations and strategic solutions. I am looking forward to making our lectures/events known and accessible for a larger audience while cultivating the existing network in the upcoming year. These new uncertain times are calling for a change in how we do things and connect, so let’s build the platform’s future together! Linkedin Jose Carrasco Montejano External Relations While the technical knowledge required to face the climate crisis is readily available, we-as humanity- are failing to take bold actions to tackle the main challenge of our time. A shared problem requires shared efforts and a wide understanding of the problem we are facing. As the person within YES DC in charge of the relationship with external organizations, I will enable our members to access all the knowledge and networking options provided by our partner organizations on a global scale. ​ Linkedin Jan Jouke Melchers Events Manager Being a YES-DC member already brought me a lot of great contacts and insights into what the global energy transition is about. With joining the board I hope that the community can inspire even more young specialists to connect and seek the interfaces where each of our individual contributions to the energy puzzle overlap. I am convinced that the energy puzzle is only solved when we explore on an individual level but cooperate on a societal level. With the diversity of YES-DC and its related network/partners we have a major role in this and I am proud to be part of the team that can set the path forward for the upcoming year.​ Linkedin Young Energy Specialists and Development Co-operation (YES-DC) is an association of students and young professionals interested and/or working in the field of energy and international co-operation.

"Aquaculture effects on environmental and public welfare - the case of Mediterranean mariculture Aquaculture effects on environmental and public welfare - the case of Mediterranean mariculture Chemosphere. 2011 Oct;85(6):899-919. doi: 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.07.015. Epub 2011 Aug 6. Authors K Grigorakis 1 , G Rigos Affiliation 1 Laboratory of Fish Nutrition and Pathology, Institute of Aquaculture, Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR), Aghios Kosmas 16777, Athens, Greece. PMID: 21821276 DOI: 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.07.015 Abstract Aquatic farming has been considered, during the last decades, as the fastest growing food production industry powered by governmental and technological impulsion. Compensation for fisheries decline, creation of new jobs and source of financial windfall are the most important benefits. However, similar to most of the human food-production activities, aquaculture raised several issues related to the environmental welfare and consumer safety. An effort to record the aquaculture-environment and -human safety interactions with regard to the Mediterranean mariculture, is attempted herein. We focused on this geographical area due to its individualities in both the hydrological and physicochemical characteristics and the forms of aquaculture activities. The cage farming of euryhaline marine fish species and more recently of bluefin tuna and mollusk farming are the dominating aquaculture activities. The impacts of these activities to the environment, through wastes offloads, introduction of alien species, genetic interactions, disease transfer, release of chemicals, use of wild recourses, alterations of coastal habitats and disturbance of wildlife, are analytically considered. Also the consumer safety issues related to the farming are assessed, including generation of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, contaminants transferred to humans though food chain and other hazards from consumption of aquacultured items. Within these, the major literature findings are critically examined and suggestions for scientific areas that need further development are made. The major tasks for future aquaculture development in this region are: (i) to ensure sustainability and (ii) to balance the risks to public or environmental health with the substantial economical benefits. In regard with monitoring, tools must be created or adapted to predict the environmental costs and estimate consumer impact. At a canonistic and legal basis, the establishment of appropriate legal guidelines and common policies from all countries involved should be mandatory. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
