Around the world, other green leaders in the industry looked at the impact of the USGBC and decided to start similar movements in their own countries, led by a GBC.[4] Individuals from across the globe were supported by the USGBC. Gottfried seeded and managed the formation of the “United Nations of the Green Building Councils” with the mission of supporting the development of GBCs, and uniting them with a common voice and purpose. In 1999, the founding meeting of WorldGBC was held in California, US. In 2002, WorldGBC was officially formed with eight founding GBCs: Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Japan, Mexico, Spain, and USA. In 2007, a Secretariat for WorldGBC was formally established in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, supported by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority – which continues to work with WorldGBC. Start-up funding of over $1 million per year for three years was provided by the Government of Ontario. Since then, WorldGBC has seen growth and evolution in its focus and structure. In 2009, WorldGBC launched five regional networks and three membership levels (Prospective, Emerging and Established). In 2010 a Corporate Advisory Board was formed to deliver strategic insight from the industry to the WorldGBC Board. By 2012, there were 71 member GBCs. The WorldGBC began to produce reports such as The Business Case for Green Building in 2013[5] and Health, Wellbeing and Productivity in Offices in 2014.[6] In 2015, the WorldGBC Board agreed a new strategic plan for the organisation with five focus areas: Membership; Regional Networks; Projects and Partnerships; Marketing, Communications and Influence; and Governance and Operations. Mission and structure[edit] WorldGBC's mission is to ""create green buildings for everyone, everywhere""[7] - enabling people to thrive both today and tomorrow. WorldGBC has a board of directors,[8] comprising building industry professionals who hold senior positions on the staff or boards of member GBCs (or who are closely affiliated with them). The board's role is to advise and oversee WorldGBC's organisational strategy and governance, and to ensure it is operating effectively as a not for profit organisation and delivering on its mission. Member Green Building Councils[edit] GBCs are independent, non-profit organisations made up of businesses and organisations working in the building and construction industry.[9] As members of WorldGBC, they work to advance green building in their own countries, as well as working with other GBCs to achieve environmental, economic and social goals on a larger, global scale. GBCs are organised into five Regional Networks[10] - powerful, collaborative platforms where they can effectively exchange knowledge, generate new ideas and design solutions that speed up green building in their own markets and across the region. WorldGBC's five main areas are the Americas, Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East and North Africa. Member GBCs also stand at one of WorldGBC's three levels of development: Prospective, Emerging and Established.[11] Corporate Advisory Board[edit] WorldGBC's Corporate Advisory Board is a select group of companies which are leaders on sustainability and which serve to guide WorldGBC on its strategy and activities.[12] The financial support of the Corporate Advisory Board enables WorldGBC to advance green buildings as an effective solution to environmental, social and economic issues, and help member Green Building Councils to grow and flourish. There are currently members of the Corporate Advisory Board: AkzoNobel, City Developments Ltd, JLL, JPMorgan Chase, Keppel Land, Lendlease, Majid Al Futtaim, Philips, Saint-Gobain, Shaw Contract, United Technologies Corporation and Volvo Construction Equipment. Supporters[edit] In addition to its Corporate Advisory Board, WorldGBC has a range of other supporters such as global project sponsors, regional project sponsors, regional partners and pro bono supporters.[13] Staff[edit] WorldGBC has 17 members of staff,[14] based in two main offices, in London and Toronto. The organisation is led by CEO Terri Wills. Five members of staff are regional heads, based in Colombia, Kenya, Singapore, London and Jordan. Activities[edit] Global projects[edit] WorldGBC's global projects enable GBCs to work together to tackle key environmental, economic and societal challenges. Current global projects include 'Advancing Net Zero',[15] which aims to promote and support the acceleration of net zero carbon buildings to 100% by 2050; and 'Better Places for People',[16] which supports GBCs and their members in increasing the demand and supply of green buildings which support the health, wellbeing and productivity of people within them. WorldGBC is also a delivery partner on the 'Building Efficiency Accelerator' (BEA),[17] a partnership of businesses, NGOs and multilateral organisations, which aims to help cities take action to improve their buildings. Regional projects[edit] WorldGBC also has projects which are specific to each of its five regions. Current regional projects include the Energy Efficiency Mortgage Action Plan (EeMAP) initiative[18] in Europe which is exploring the link between energy efficiency and borrower's reduced probability of default and the increase in value of energy efficient properties. World Green Building Week[edit] World Green Building Week[19] is an annual global event led by WorldGBC, its network of more than 70 GBCs and their 49,000 members. Beginning in 2009, the week involves special events promoting public awareness of sustainability and green building around a selected theme: In 2011 World Green Building Week had 129 events in 27 countries on a theme of ""Green Buildings in the New Green Economy"". In 2012, the week had 130 events across 30 countries; the theme was ""Green Buildings for Great Communities"".[20][21] In 2013, the week had 220 events across 33 countries; the theme was ""Greener Buildings, Better Places, Healthier People"".[22] In 2014 the theme was ""Get Up, Green Up,"" which focused on encouraging others to take action on sustainable efforts.[23] 2015's theme was ""Powering Positive Change"". 2016's theme was ""Change Your Perspective"", inviting people to think differently about buildings and how they can have major environmental, economic and societal benefits. 2017's theme was ""Our Hero Is Zero"", which focused on the need to make all buildings net zero by 2050, in line with WorldGBC's Advancing Net Zero project. WorldGBC Congress[edit] Since 2014 WorldGBC has hosted a congress - a gathering of its member councils and an international conference. The congress is jointly organised by WorldGBC and the host country's GBC. Congresses have been held in São Paulo, Brazil (2014), Hong Kong, China (2015), Stockholm, Sweden (2016), and Jaipur, India (2017). The 2018 congress will be in Toronto, Canada,[24] and 2019's will be in Paris, France.[25] WorldGBC awards[edit] WorldGBC presents two major annual awards recognising the contributions of individuals to the global green building movement.[26] The Chairman's Award is given to individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to the global green building movement, while the David Gottfried Award is presented to individuals whose contribution to the global green building movement has been shown to be unique, innovative and entrepreneurial. These awards are presented at the WorldGBC Congress. WorldGBC also hosts the Asia Pacific Regional Network Awards every two years,[27] and supports the MENA Green Building Awards.[28] Partnership[edit] WorldGBC has a partnership with the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction.[29] It aims to gather the support of countries, cities and public and private organisations to ensure the sector helps to meet the Paris Agreement and global goals on climate change. WorldGBC sits on the interim steering committee of the Alliance, developing strong governance to support the 24 countries and 72 non-state organisations which are affiliated with it. Impact[edit] In December 2017, WorldGBC published its latest annual report,[30] outlining the achievements of the organisation and its global network of GBCs over the previous year. These include 1.24 billion m2 of green building space around the world that has been certified by member Green Building Councils; five new net zero building certifications launched by GBCs through the Advancing Net Zero project; and 31 countries making green building policy changes at either the city, regional or national level, with contributions from GBC.

Google Maps click to enlarge Satellite image of La Palma Correctional Center, where Aamir Sheikh went on hunger strike. Google Maps Immigration officials sought and received permission from a federal court to force-feed a Pakistani national who went on a hunger strike more than two weeks ago at a private Eloy detention center, but the potential treatment has been called torture by the United Nations. Aamir Hafiz Sheikh started refusing meals on March 10 out of frustration that Pakistani officials have not provided a travel document he needs for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deport him. Sheikh claimed to medical staffers that he intermittently drank sips of water, but officials have not observed him doing so. He was ordered deported by an immigration judge on May 3, 2018, and the 44-year-old immigrant has been detained at La Palma Correctional Facility since August 27, 2018. Sheikh, who owned businesses in Phoenix and Mesa, was convicted of food stamp fraud in 2015. Three days into his hunger strike, Sheikh was treated for dehydration and stomach inflammation at Banner Casa Grande Medical Center. Sheikh has refused medical monitoring since his hospital visit, according to federal officials.

Support Us Keep New Times Free. Support Us “Due to the inability to assess his exact medical state, there is concern of Mr. Sheikh going into renal failure, liver failure, or becoming comatose due to dehydration and hypotension, which could lead to his death,"" wrote first assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Strange. The federal government sought an emergency order to ""administer necessary hydration and nutritional supplements"" to Sheikh. U.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa then issued an order on March 22 granting ICE authority to force-feed Sheikh through a nasal tube or intravenous line. Humetewa's order also allows ICE to restrain Sheikh if he refuses to cooperate and perform involuntary medical examinations on him. A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately respond to a question asking whether the agency has force-fed Sheikh or whether he is still on a hunger strike. Sheikh does not appear to be represented by an attorney, according to federal court records. ICE drew international attention in January when it used nasal tubes to force-feed nine hunger-striking Indian nationals in El Paso, Texas. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a statement suggesting the practice could constitute a violation of the UN Convention Against Torture. ICE stopped force-feeding the El Paso detainees in February, Texas Monthly reported. The practice of force-feeding inmates through a nasal tube is controversial in the medical field. The American Medical Association opposed the practice when it was used on detainees at Guantanamo Bay, saying, “Force feeding of detainees violates core ethical values of the medical profession.” The World Medical Association has also condemned force-feeding. Liz Martinez, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Freedom for Immigrants, said that there have been more than 1,400 cases of immigrant detainees going on hunger strikes since the group began keeping track of such cases in May 2015. Martinez said she only knows of one other case, which took place in Georgia in 2017, in which a federal court granted permission for ICE to force-feed a detainee via nasal tube. Immigrant-advocacy groups have recently argued in a case in Tacoma, Washington, that hunger-striking constitutes constitutionally protected free speech and that force-feeding violates that right. ""It’s not only a violation of the First Amendment, but also medically unethical and barbaric,"" Martinez said in a phone interview. ""It’s extremely painful."" La Palma Correctional Center, the private prison where Sheikh is being held, is owned by CoreCivic. The facility started housing immigrant detainees in July, after CoreCivic entered into a contract with the federal government. Before then, the prison mostly took convicts from California. The immigrant-rights organization Puente claimed in September that more than 100 immigrant detainees at La Palma started a hunger strike in September, demanding regular access to bathrooms and showers and three meals a day. A spokesperson for ICE, however, told local National Public Radio affiliate KJZZ at the time that there was no hunger strike. Sheikh's most recent hunger strike is his fourth, according to an affidavit submitted by Dr. William Crane, a physician at La Palma. The Pakistani national also went on hunger strikes from November 26 to December 4, from January 22 to February 1, and from March 6 to 9. All of those strikes ended with Sheikh eating, Crane testified.

(January 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) World Medical AssociationWMA logoFounded18 September 1947LocationFerney-Voltaire, FranceMembers 115 Constituent Members and 1467 Associate Members (2021)Key peopleDr. David Barbe (President), Prof. Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery (Chairperson of Council)Websitewww.wma.net The World Medical Association (WMA) is an international and independent confederation of free professional medical associations representing physicians worldwide. WMA was formally established on September 18, 1947[1] and has grown to 115 national medical associations, as of 2021, with 1467 Associate Members, including Junior Doctors and medical students. [2][3] and more than 10 million physicians. WMA is in official relations with the World Health Organization (WHO) and seeks close collaboration with the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to physical and mental health. Contents 1 History 2 Governance 2.1 General Assembly 2.2 Council 3 Secretariat 4 Official languages 5 Membership 6 Projects 7 Controversies 8 See also 9 References 10 External links History[edit] The WMA was founded on 18 September 1947, when physicians from 27 different countries met at the First General Assembly of the WMA in Paris. This organization was built from an idea born in the House of the British Medical Association in 1945, within a meeting organized in London to initiate plans for an international medical organization to replace l'Association Professionnelle Internationale des Médecins"", which had suspended its activities because of World War II.[1] In order to facilitate financial support from its member associations, in 1948, the executive board, known as the Council, established the Secretariat of the WMA in New York City in order to provide close liaison with the United Nations and its various agencies. The WMA Secretariat remained in New York City until 1974 when for reasons of economy, and in order to operate within the vicinity of Geneva-based international organizations (WHO, ILO, ICN, ISSA, etc.) it was transferred to its present location in Ferney-Voltaire, France. The WMA members gathered in an annual meeting, which from 1962 was named ""World Medical Assembly."" Since its beginning WMA has shown concern over the state of medical ethics in general and over the world, and worked on a modernized wording of the ancient oath of Hippocrates, which was sent for consideration at the II General Assembly in Geneva in 1948. The medical vow was adopted and the Assembly agreed to name it the ""Declaration of Geneva."" Also in the same II General Assembly a report on ""War Crimes and Medicine"" was received. This prompted the Council to appoint another Study Committee to prepare an International Code of Medical Ethics, which after an extensive discussion, was adopted in 1949 by the III General Assembly. Governance[edit] General Assembly[edit] The main decision-making body of the WMA is the General Assembly, which meets annually and is formed by delegations from the National Member Associations, officers and members of the Council of the WMA, and representatives of the Associate Members (Associate Members are individual physicians who wish to join the WMA). Council[edit] The Assembly elects the WMA Council every two years with representatives drawn from each of the six WMA regions, namely Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America and the Pacific. It also elects the WMA president annually, who is the Ceremonial Head of the WMA. The President, President Elect and Immediate Past President form the Presidium that is available to speak for the WMA and represent it officially. Every two years, the WMA Council, excluding the Presidium, elects a Chairperson who is the political head of the organization. As Chief Executive of the operational units of the WMA, the Secretary-General is in full-time employment at the Secretariat, appointed by the WMA Council. Secretariat[edit] The WMA Secretariat is situated in Ferney-Voltaire, France, adjacent to the City of Geneva. Since 2005, Dr. Otmar Kloiber is the Secretary-General. Official languages[edit] English, French, and Spanish are the official languages of the association since its creation. Membership[edit] Map showing the 112 WMA Constituent Members The WMA have the following status of membership: Constituent Membership: Mainly applies for members who are typically National Associations of Physicians from different countries in the world (sometimes these organizations are called National Medical Associations).[4] Such associations are broadly representative of the physicians of their country by virtue of their membership. They range from chambers to orders, from colleges to private associations. Some of these have compulsory membership and some are trade unions. Associate Membership: Applies for Individual physicians that want to join the WMA and who have voting rights at the Annual Associate Members Meeting and the right to participate in the General Assembly through the chosen representatives of the Associate Members. See more information on Membership by clicking on the following link (WMA Membership): Projects[edit] The WMA is active in several areas of action,[5] but mainly in: Advocacy Ethics Health Systems Human Rights Public Health In what concerns Ethics, the WMA has various Declarations, Resolutions and Statements with which tries to help to guide National Medical Associations, governments and international organizations throughout the world. A wide range of subjects are covered like the rights of patients, research on human subjects, care of the sick and wounded in times of armed conflict, torture of prisoners, the use and abuse of drugs, family planning and pollution.[6] WMA also works on: Medical education Human resources planning for health care services Patient safety Leadership and career development Advocacy for physicians' and patients' rights Occupational health and safety Democracy building for new medical associations Public health policy Projects such as tobacco control and immunization The WMA also works on Education Programs such as the prison-medicine course, the MDR-TB and the TB refresher course, the ethics course and the course on microbial resistance (together with the George Mason University and the International Society for Microbial Resistance). The WMA Medical Ethics Manual The World Medical and Health Policy Journal Caring Physicians of the World Controversies[edit] During the World Medical Association General Assembly in Reykjavik in early October 2018, members of the Canadian Medical Association stated that parts of the speech by WMA's incoming president Leonid Eidelman had been plagiarized from a speech made in 2014 by Chris Simpson (cardiologist) who was then the president of CMA. Current president Dr. Gigi Osler told the group that part of the address was ""copied word for word"" from Simpson's speech. ""Multiple other parts of the speech were also copied from various websites, blogs and news articles, without proper appropriate attribution to the authors"", she latter added in a statement. A motion by Canada at the Assembly to call on Eidelman to resign was not successful.[7] On 6 October, the CMA resigned; their press release stated that the decision was made because WMA was not upholding ethical standards.[8] In an email to The Canadian Press, WMA spokesman Nigel Duncan said that Eidelman's speech had been written by others and that he did not know that it might contain plagiarism.[7] A WMA source also told The Canadian Press that Eidelman apologized at the general assembly, after the Canadian delegates had departed; he ""acknowledge[d] that part of his speech was taken from Simpson"", and most delegates ""accepted his apology"" for the mistake.[9][10] See also[edit] Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) Declaration of Geneva Declaration of Helsinki Declaration of Tokyo.

This organization was built from an idea born in the House of the British Medical Association in 1945, within a meeting organized in London to initiate plans for an international medical organization to replace l'Association Professionnelle Internationale des Médecins"", which had suspended its activities because of World War II.[1] In order to facilitate financial support from its member associations, in 1948, the executive board, known as the Council, established the Secretariat of the WMA in New York City in order to provide close liaison with the United Nations and its various agencies. The WMA Secretariat remained in New York City until 1974 when for reasons of economy, and in order to operate within the vicinity of Geneva-based international organizations (WHO, ILO, ICN, ISSA, etc.) it was transferred to its present location in Ferney-Voltaire, France. The WMA members gathered in an annual meeting, which from 1962 was named ""World Medical Assembly."" Since its beginning WMA has shown concern over the state of medical ethics in general and over the world, and worked on a modernized wording of the ancient oath of Hippocrates, which was sent for consideration at the II General Assembly in Geneva in 1948. The medical vow was adopted and the Assembly agreed to name it the ""Declaration of Geneva."" Also in the same II General Assembly a report on ""War Crimes and Medicine"" was received. This prompted the Council to appoint another Study Committee to prepare an International Code of Medical Ethics, which after an extensive discussion, was adopted in 1949 by the III General Assembly. Governance[edit] General Assembly[edit] The main decision-making body of the WMA is the General Assembly, which meets annually and is formed by delegations from the National Member Associations, officers and members of the Council of the WMA, and representatives of the Associate Members (Associate Members are individual physicians who wish to join the WMA). Council[edit] The Assembly elects the WMA Council every two years with representatives drawn from each of the six WMA regions, namely Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America and the Pacific. It also elects the WMA president annually, who is the Ceremonial Head of the WMA. The President, President Elect and Immediate Past President form the Presidium that is available to speak for the WMA and represent it officially. Every two years, the WMA Council, excluding the Presidium, elects a Chairperson who is the political head of the organization. As Chief Executive of the operational units of the WMA, the Secretary-General is in full-time employment at the Secretariat, appointed by the WMA Council. Secretariat[edit] The WMA Secretariat is situated in Ferney-Voltaire, France, adjacent to the City of Geneva. Since 2005, Dr. Otmar Kloiber is the Secretary-General. Official languages[edit] English, French, and Spanish are the official languages of the association since its creation. Membership[edit] Map showing the 112 WMA Constituent Members The WMA have the following status of membership: Constituent Membership: Mainly applies for members who are typically National Associations of Physicians from different countries in the world (sometimes these organizations are called National Medical Associations).[4] Such associations are broadly representative of the physicians of their country by virtue of their membership. They range from chambers to orders, from colleges to private associations. Some of these have compulsory membership and some are trade unions. Associate Membership: Applies for Individual physicians that want to join the WMA and who have voting rights at the Annual Associate Members Meeting and the right to participate in the General Assembly through the chosen representatives of the Associate Members. See more information on Membership by clicking on the following link (WMA Membership): Projects[edit] The WMA is active in several areas of action,[5] but mainly in: Advocacy Ethics Health Systems Human Rights Public Health In what concerns Ethics, the WMA has various Declarations, Resolutions and Statements with which tries to help to guide National Medical Associations, governments and international organizations throughout the world. A wide range of subjects are covered like the rights of patients, research on human subjects, care of the sick and wounded in times of armed conflict, torture of prisoners, the use and abuse of drugs, family planning and pollution.[6] WMA also works on: Medical education Human resources planning for health care services Patient safety Leadership and career development Advocacy for physicians' and patients' rights Occupational health and safety Democracy building for new medical associations Public health policy Projects such as tobacco control and immunization The WMA also works on Education Programs such as the prison-medicine course, the MDR-TB and the TB refresher course, the ethics course and the course on microbial resistance (together with the George Mason University and the International Society for Microbial Resistance). The WMA Medical Ethics Manual The World Medical and Health Policy Journal Caring Physicians of the World Controversies[edit] During the World Medical Association General Assembly in Reykjavik in early October 2018, members of the Canadian Medical Association stated that parts of the speech by WMA's incoming president Leonid Eidelman had been plagiarized from a speech made in 2014 by Chris Simpson (cardiologist) who was then the president of CMA. Current president Dr. Gigi Osler told the group that part of the address was ""copied word for word"" from Simpson's speech. ""Multiple other parts of the speech were also copied from various websites, blogs and news articles, without proper appropriate attribution to the authors"", she latter added in a statement. A motion by Canada at the Assembly to call on Eidelman to resign was not successful.[7] On 6 October, the CMA resigned; their press release stated that the decision was made because WMA was not upholding ethical standards.[8] In an email to The Canadian Press, WMA spokesman Nigel Duncan said that Eidelman's speech had been written by others and that he did not know that it might contain plagiarism.[7] A WMA source also told The Canadian Press that Eidelman apologized at the general assembly, after the Canadian delegates had departed; he ""acknowledge[d] that part of his speech was taken from Simpson"", and most delegates ""accepted his apology"" for the mistake.[9][10] See also[edit] Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) Declaration of Geneva Declaration of Helsinki Declaration of Tokyo.

The World Medical Association (WMA) is an international organization representing physicians. It was founded on 17 September 1947, when physicians from 27 different countries met at the First General Assembly of the WMA in Paris. The organization was created to ensure the independence of physicians, and to work for the highest possible standards of ethical behaviour and care by physicians, at all times. This was particularly important to physicians after the Second World War, and therefore the WMA has always been an independent confederation of free professional associations. Funding has been by the annual contributions of its members, which has now grown to 115 National Medical Associations. The WMA provides a forum for its member associations to communicate freely, to co-operate actively, to achieve consensus on high standards of medical ethics and professional competence, and to promote the professional freedom of physicians worldwide. This unique partnership facilitates high-calibre, humane care to patients in a healthy environment, enhancing the quality of life for all people in the world. What is its mission? The purpose of the WMA is to serve humanity by endeavoring to achieve the highest international standards in Medical Education, Medical Science, Medical Art and Medical Ethics, and Health Care for all people in the world. What we do? As an organization promoting the highest possible standards of medical ethics, the WMA provides ethical guidance to physicians through its Declarations, Resolutions and Statements. These also help to guide National Medical Associations, governments and international organizations throughout the world. The Declarations, Resolutions and Statements cover a wide range of subjects, including an International Code of Medical Ethics, the rights of patients, research on human subjects, care of the sick and wounded in times of armed conflict, torture of prisoners, the use and abuse of drugs, family planning and pollution. Others areas of service: Health-related human rights – promoting and defending the basic rights of patients and physicians Medical education – helping physicians to continuously improve their knowledge and skills Human resources planning for health care services Patient safety Public health policy and projects such as tobacco control, immunization Democracy building for new medical associations, especially in new or developing democracies Leadership and career development Advocacy for physicians’ and patients’ rights Occupational health and safety Partnerships and Alliances: The WMA is in official relations with the World Health Organization (WHO). Partnerships and alliances with other health professional associations, governmental and non-governmental agencies and regional medical associations support the work of the WMA to provide the best possible care to the patients of the world. In particular, the World Health Professions Alliance (www.whpa.org) combines the strengths of the international professional associations for physicians, nurses and pharmacists to advocate and work for the highest possible standards of health care for all people.

Introduction There are different categories of membership within the WMA: Constituent Membership – This category of members is typically represented by National Associations of Physicians from different countries in the world. Such associations are broadly representative of the physicians of their country by virtue of their membership, with their voting membership being limited to physicians and medical students. They are not subject to, or controlled by, any office or agency of government. Associate Membership – Individual physicians can join the WMA as Associate Members, with voting rights at the Annual Associate Members Meeting and the right to participate in the General Assembly through the chosen representatives of the Associate Members. Other classes of Membership can also be established by the Assembly, should it be appropriate and in the best interest of the WMA. Benefits of Membership Recognition and acceptance as a member of an international organization such as the WMA lends tremendous credibility to a National Medical Association (NMA). This is particularly true when there is more than one professional association representing physicians in a country. The WMA is in official relations with United Nations agencies such as the World Health Organization, which gives NMAs and Associate Members access to these world bodies. By participating in the debate with colleagues from all over the world, NMAs and Associate Members have the opportunity to provide the world with valuable ethical guidance and leadership in health care. Information and knowledge can be sourced from the WMA, which can contribute to the optimal efficacy of NMAs and individual physicians. NMAs and Associate Members can make use of the WMA’s products and services.

(January 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) World Medical AssociationWMA logoFounded18 September 1947LocationFerney-Voltaire, FranceMembers 115 Constituent Members and 1467 Associate Members (2021)Key peopleDr. David Barbe (President), Prof. Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery (Chairperson of Council)Websitewww.wma.net The World Medical Association (WMA) is an international and independent confederation of free professional medical associations representing physicians worldwide. WMA was formally established on September 18, 1947[1] and has grown to 115 national medical associations, as of 2021, with 1467 Associate Members, including Junior Doctors and medical students. [2][3] and more than 10 million physicians. WMA is in official relations with the World Health Organization (WHO) and seeks close collaboration with the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to physical and mental health. Contents 1 History 2 Governance 2.1 General Assembly 2.2 Council 3 Secretariat 4 Official languages 5 Membership 6 Projects 7 Controversies 8 See also 9 References 10 External links History[edit] The WMA was founded on 18 September 1947, when physicians from 27 different countries met at the First General Assembly of the WMA in Paris. This organization was built from an idea born in the House of the British Medical Association in 1945, within a meeting organized in London to initiate plans for an international medical organization to replace l'Association Professionnelle Internationale des Médecins"", which had suspended its activities because of World War II.[1] In order to facilitate financial support from its member associations, in 1948, the executive board, known as the Council, established the Secretariat of the WMA in New York City in order to provide close liaison with the United Nations and its various agencies. The WMA Secretariat remained in New York City until 1974 when for reasons of economy, and in order to operate within the vicinity of Geneva-based international organizations (WHO, ILO, ICN, ISSA, etc.) it was transferred to its present location in Ferney-Voltaire, France. The WMA members gathered in an annual meeting, which from 1962 was named ""World Medical Assembly."" Since its beginning WMA has shown concern over the state of medical ethics in general and over the world, and worked on a modernized wording of the ancient oath of Hippocrates, which was sent for consideration at the II General Assembly in Geneva in 1948. The medical vow was adopted and the Assembly agreed to name it the ""Declaration of Geneva."" Also in the same II General Assembly a report on ""War Crimes and Medicine"" was received. This prompted the Council to appoint another Study Committee to prepare an International Code of Medical Ethics, which after an extensive discussion, was adopted in 1949 by the III General Assembly. Governance[edit] General Assembly[edit] The main decision-making body of the WMA is the General Assembly, which meets annually and is formed by delegations from the National Member Associations, officers and members of the Council of the WMA, and representatives of the Associate Members (Associate Members are individual physicians who wish to join the WMA). Council[edit] The Assembly elects the WMA Council every two years with representatives drawn from each of the six WMA regions, namely Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America and the Pacific. It also elects the WMA president annually, who is the Ceremonial Head of the WMA. The President, President Elect and Immediate Past President form the Presidium that is available to speak for the WMA and represent it officially. Every two years, the WMA Council, excluding the Presidium, elects a Chairperson who is the political head of the organization. As Chief Executive of the operational units of the WMA, the Secretary-General is in full-time employment at the Secretariat, appointed by the WMA Council. Secretariat[edit] The WMA Secretariat is situated in Ferney-Voltaire, France, adjacent to the City of Geneva. Since 2005, Dr. Otmar Kloiber is the Secretary-General. Official languages[edit] English, French, and Spanish are the official languages of the association since its creation. Membership[edit] Map showing the 112 WMA Constituent Members The WMA have the following status of membership: Constituent Membership: Mainly applies for members who are typically National Associations of Physicians from different countries in the world (sometimes these organizations are called National Medical Associations).[4] Such associations are broadly representative of the physicians of their country by virtue of their membership. They range from chambers to orders, from colleges to private associations. Some of these have compulsory membership and some are trade unions. Associate Membership: Applies for Individual physicians that want to join the WMA and who have voting rights at the Annual Associate Members Meeting and the right to participate in the General Assembly through the chosen representatives of the Associate Members. See more information on Membership by clicking on the following link (WMA Membership): Projects[edit] The WMA is active in several areas of action,[5] but mainly in: Advocacy Ethics Health Systems Human Rights Public Health In what concerns Ethics, the WMA has various Declarations, Resolutions and Statements with which tries to help to guide National Medical Associations, governments and international organizations throughout the world. A wide range of subjects are covered like the rights of patients, research on human subjects, care of the sick and wounded in times of armed conflict, torture of prisoners, the use and abuse of drugs, family planning and pollution.[6] WMA also works on: Medical education Human resources planning for health care services Patient safety Leadership and career development Advocacy for physicians' and patients' rights Occupational health and safety Democracy building for new medical associations Public health policy Projects such as tobacco control and immunization The WMA also works on Education Programs such as the prison-medicine course, the MDR-TB and the TB refresher course, the ethics course and the course on microbial resistance (together with the George Mason University and the International Society for Microbial Resistance). The WMA Medical Ethics Manual The World Medical and Health Policy Journal Caring Physicians of the World Controversies[edit] During the World Medical Association General Assembly in Reykjavik in early October 2018, members of the Canadian Medical Association stated that parts of the speech by WMA's incoming president Leonid Eidelman had been plagiarized from a speech made in 2014 by Chris Simpson (cardiologist) who was then the president of CMA. Current president Dr. Gigi Osler told the group that part of the address was ""copied word for word"" from Simpson's speech. ""Multiple other parts of the speech were also copied from various websites, blogs and news articles, without proper appropriate attribution to the authors"", she latter added in a statement. A motion by Canada at the Assembly to call on Eidelman to resign was not successful.[7] On 6 October, the CMA resigned; their press release stated that the decision was made because WMA was not upholding ethical standards.[8] In an email to The Canadian Press, WMA spokesman Nigel Duncan said that Eidelman's speech had been written by others and that he did not know that it might contain plagiarism.[7] A WMA source also told The Canadian Press that Eidelman apologized at the general assembly, after the Canadian delegates had departed; he ""acknowledge[d] that part of his speech was taken from Simpson"", and most delegates ""accepted his apology"" for the mistake.[9][10] See also[edit] Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) Declaration of Geneva Declaration of Helsinki Declaration of Tokyo.

The WOC is an international organization registered in the US, has a global footprint of action and Membership and is administrated by the Secretariat under the direction of a Board of Directors comprised of senior industry representatives from around the world. History Since its inception as a network of ocean businesses concerned with ocean stewardship, the WOC has grown to become the only international and cross-sectoral industry leadership alliance focused on “Corporate Ocean Responsibility” on a global scale. Aligning core ocean business interests with sustainable development is critical to achieving healthy oceans. The WOC was created to address the Ocean Business Community’s needs, opportunities and challenges for a coordinated cross sectoral approach to ocean sustainable development, responsible use and environmental management. In the mid-1990s, Mr Paul Holthus was co-leading the Global Marine Program of IUCN-The World Conservation Union. Outreach to ocean industries confirmed the business community’s interest in ocean sustainability issues, but revealed the limitations of what responsible companies could achieve individually. Many companies were interested in developing inter-industry leadership and collaboration as a way to better address ocean issues, but saw no means of making this happen. The need and opportunity for a global industry alliance on ocean sustainable development became clear and compelling. Paul set out in the early 2000s to build a network of ocean-related companies concerned with the health of the marine environment and began organizing private sector panels at the biennial multi-stakeholder Global Oceans Conferences held at UNESCO. The industry panelists were energized by the opportunity to meet colleagues from other sectors who were also concerned about ocean stewardship. They encouraged Paul to expand the opportunities for a global marine industry interaction. Building on this, international Business and Industry Leaders Roundtables on Ocean Sustainability were twice convened (Lisbon, 2005; Paris, 2006), at which participants called for the creation of an ongoing structure and process for industry interaction on ocean sustainable development. With this steadily growing interest and momentum from the Ocean Business Community, the World Ocean Council was registered in early 2010 in the US as a nonprofit organization focused on working with the Ocean Business Community on ocean sustainability, science and stewardship. Numerous organizations from the diverse global Ocean Business Community interested in “Corporate Ocean Responsibility” have since signed up to become Members. The representation of various sectors and industries has allowed the WOC to have an impactful contribution to a growing number of governmental and intergovernmental bodies, and to ensure the engagement of the Ocean Business Community in ocean policy formation. The WOC organized the first international, cross-sectoral ocean industry conference on “Corporate Ocean Responsibility” in 2010, when the inaugural Sustainable Ocean Summit (SOS) was held in Belfast, Ireland. With a commitment to advancing the development and implementation of industry-driven solutions to ocean sustainability challenges, subsequent Sustainable Ocean Summits were convened in Washington DC 2013 on “Oceans 2050 — The Ocean Business Community and Sustainable Seas”, in Singapore 2015 on “Sustainable Development and Growing the Blue Economy – the Next 50 Years”, in Rotterdam 2016 on “Ocean 2030: Sustainable Development Goals and the Ocean Business Community”, in Halifax 2017 on “The Ocean Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 14): Business Leadership and Business Opportunities”, in Hong Kong 2018 on “Ocean Sustainable Development – Connecting Asia and the World”, and in Paris 2019 on “Investing in Ocean Futures: Finance and Innovation in the Blue Economy”.

OUTLAW OCEAN MUSIC PROJECT: WHERE MUSIC MEETS JOURNALISM All music in this project is based on THE OUTLAW OCEAN, a New York Times best-selling book by Ian Urbina that chronicles lawlessness at sea around the world. The reporting touches on a diversity of abuses ranging from illegal and overfishing, arms trafficking at sea, human slavery, gun-running, intentional dumping, murder of stowaways, thievery of ships, and other topics. The music is an act of solidarity across geography and language, and an attempt at storytelling from written word to music. It is a captivating collection of inspired songs. Take your pick: listen to ambient tracks, classical, electronic or hiphop.

GO2NE is moreover preparing a summary on deoxygenation for policy makers. In collaboration with SFB754, it recently initiated the news site ocean-oxygen.org to provide information on deoxygenation to scientists, stakeholders and the interested public. Deoxygenation – Open Ocean and Coastal Waters Oxygen is critical to the health of the planet. It affects the cycles of carbon, nitrogen and other key elements, and is a fundamental requirement for marine life from the seashore to the greatest depths of the ocean. Nevertheless, deoxygenation is worsening in the coastal and open ocean. This is mainly the result of human activities that are increasing global temperatures (CO2-induced warming) and increasing loads of nutrients from agriculture, sewage, and industrial waste, including pollution from power generation from fossil fuels and biomass. There are 10 main ocean oxygen concerns: Increasing temperatures will reduce the capacity of the ocean to hold oxygen in the future; Oxygen deficiency is predicted to worsen in estuaries, coastal areas and oxygen minimum zones in the open ocean; The ocean’s capacity to produce oxygen will be reduced in the future. Habitat loss is expected to worsen, leading to vertical and horizontal migration of species; Oxygen deficiency will alter biogeochemical cycles and food webs; Lower oxygen concentrations are projected to result in a decrease in reproductive capacity and biodiversity loss; There are important local decreases of commercially important species and aquaculture production; Harmful Algal Blooms might benefit from nutrients released in bottom waters due to hypoxia (e.g. in the Baltic Sea); Reduced ocean oxygen concentrations will lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, thereby initiating feedbacks on climate change; Future scenarios for oxygen depend on a combination of drivers related to global environmental change and land-use, including warming, growing human population, and extensive coastal agricultural practices, which, in turn, act together in affecting marine ecosystems – thus, a multi-stressor approach is important.

It is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura, spanning a total area of 41,285 km2 (15,940 sq mi) and land area of 39,997 km2 (15,443 sq mi). Although the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately 8.5 million is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities and economic centres are located, among them Zürich, Geneva and Basel. These cities are home to several offices of international organisations such as the WTO, the WHO, the ILO, the headquarters of FIFA, the UN's second-largest office, as well as the main building of the Bank for International Settlements. The main international airports of Switzerland are also located in these cities. The establishment of the Old Swiss Confederacy dates to the late medieval period, resulting from a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy. Swiss independence from the Holy Roman Empire was formally recognised in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. The Federal Charter of 1291 is considered the founding document of Switzerland which is celebrated on Swiss National Day. Since the Reformation of the 16th century, Switzerland has maintained a strong policy of armed neutrality; it has not fought an international war since 1815 and did not join the United Nations until 2002. Nevertheless, it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace-building processes around the world.[15] Switzerland is the birthplace of the Red Cross, one of the world's oldest and best known humanitarian organisations. It is a founding member of the European Free Trade Association, but notably not part of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Eurozone. However, it participates in the Schengen Area and the European Single Market through bilateral treaties. Switzerland occupies the crossroads of Germanic and Romance Europe, as reflected in its four main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French, Italian and Romansh. Although the majority of the population are German-speaking, Swiss national identity is rooted in a common historical background, shared values such as federalism and direct democracy,[16] as well as Alpine symbolism.[17][18] Due to its linguistic diversity, Switzerland is known by a variety of native names: Schweiz [ˈʃvaɪts] (German);[note 5] Suisse [sɥis(ə)] (French); Svizzera [ˈzvittsera] (Italian); and Svizra [ˈʒviːtsrɐ, ˈʒviːtsʁɐ] (Romansh).[note 6] On coins and stamps, the Latin name, Confoederatio Helvetica – frequently shortened to ""Helvetia"" – is used instead of the four national languages. A developed country, it has the highest nominal wealth per adult[19] and the eighth-highest per capita gross domestic product; it has been considered a tax haven.[20][21] It ranks highly on some international metrics, including economic competitiveness and human development. Its cities such as Zürich, Geneva and Basel rank among the highest in the world in terms of quality of life,[22][23] albeit with some of the highest costs of living in the world.[24] In 2020, IMD placed Switzerland first in attracting skilled workers.[25] The WEF ranks it the fifth most competitive country globally.[26] Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2.1 Early history 2.2 Old Swiss Confederacy 2.3 Napoleonic era 2.4 Federal state 2.5 Modern history 3 Geography 3.1 Climate 3.2 Environment 4 Politics 4.1 Direct democracy 4.2 Cantons 4.2.1 Municipalities 4.3 Foreign relations and international institutions 4.4 Military 4.5 The capital or Federal City issue 5 Economy and labour law 5.1 Taxation and government spending 5.2 Labour market 5.3 Education and science 5.4 Switzerland and the European Union 5.5 Energy, infrastructure and environment 6 Demographics 6.1 Languages 6.2 Health 6.3 Urbanisation 6.3.1 Largest cities 6.4 Religion 7 Culture 7.1 Literature 7.2 Media 7.3 Sports 7.4 Cuisine 8 See also 9 Notes and references 9.1 Notes 9.2 References 10 Bibliography 11 External links Etymology Main article: Name of Switzerland The English name Switzerland is a compound containing Switzer, an obsolete term for the Swiss, which was in use during the 16th to 19th centuries.[27] The English adjective Swiss is a loan from French Suisse, also in use since the 16th century. The name Switzer is from the Alemannic Schwiizer, in origin an inhabitant of Schwyz and its associated territory, one of the Waldstätte cantons which formed the nucleus of the Old Swiss Confederacy. The Swiss began to adopt the name for themselves after the Swabian War of 1499, used alongside the term for ""Confederates"", Eidgenossen (literally: comrades by oath), used since the 14th century. The data code for Switzerland, CH, is derived from Latin Confoederatio Helvetica (English: Helvetic Confederation). The toponym Schwyz itself was first attested in 972, as Old High German Suittes, ultimately perhaps related to swedan ‘to burn’ (cf. Old Norse svíða ‘to singe, burn’), referring to the area of forest that was burned and cleared to build.[28] The name was extended to the area dominated by the canton, and after the Swabian War of 1499 gradually came to be used for the entire Confederation.[29][30] The Swiss German name of the country, Schwiiz, is homophonous to that of the canton and the settlement, but distinguished by the use of the definite article (d'Schwiiz for the Confederation,[31] but simply Schwyz for the canton and the town).[32] The long [iː] of Swiss German is historically and still often today spelled ⟨y⟩ rather than ⟨ii⟩, preserving the original identity of the two names even in writing. The Latin name Confoederatio Helvetica was neologized and introduced gradually after the formation of the federal state in 1848, harking back to the Napoleonic Helvetic Republic, appearing on coins from 1879, inscribed on the Federal Palace in 1902 and after 1948 used in the official seal[33] (e.g., the ISO banking code ""CHF"" for the Swiss franc, and the country top-level domain "".ch"", are both taken from the state's Latin name). Helvetica is derived from the Helvetii, a Gaulish tribe living on the Swiss plateau before the Roman era. Helvetia appears as a national personification of the Swiss confederacy in the 17th century with a 1672 play by Johann Caspar Weissenbach.[34] History Main article: History of Switzerland Switzerland has existed as a state in its present form since the adoption of the Swiss Federal Constitution in 1848. The precursors of Switzerland established a protective alliance at the end of the 13th century (1291), forming a loose confederation of states which persisted for centuries. Early history Main articles: Early history of Switzerland and Switzerland in the Roman era The oldest traces of hominid existence in Switzerland date back about 150,000 years.[35] The oldest known farming settlements in Switzerland, which were found at Gächlingen, have been dated to around 5300 BC.[35] Founded in 44 BC by Lucius Munatius Plancus, Augusta Raurica (near Basel) was the first Roman settlement on the Rhine and is now among the most important archaeological sites in Switzerland.[36] The earliest known cultural tribes of the area were members of the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures, named after the archaeological site of La Tène on the north side of Lake Neuchâtel. La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age from around 450 BC,[35] possibly under some influence from the Greek and Etruscan civilisations. One of the most important tribal groups in the Swiss region was the Helvetii. Steadily harassed by the Germanic tribes, in 58 BC the Helvetii decided to abandon the Swiss plateau and migrate to western Gallia, but Julius Caesar's armies pursued and defeated them at the Battle of Bibracte, in today's eastern France, forcing the tribe to move back to its original homeland.[35] In 15 BC, Tiberius, who would one day become the second Roman emperor, and his brother Drusus, conquered the Alps, integrating them into the Roman Empire. The area occupied by the Helvetii—the namesakes of the later Confoederatio Helvetica—first became part of Rome's Gallia Belgica province and then of its Germania Superior province, while the eastern portion of modern Switzerland was integrated into the Roman province of Raetia. Sometime around the start of the Common Era, the Romans maintained a large legionary camp called Vindonissa, now a ruin at the confluence of the Aare and Reuss rivers, near the town of Windisch, an outskirt of Brugg. The first and second century AD was an age of prosperity for the population living on the Swiss plateau. Several towns, like Aventicum, Iulia Equestris and Augusta Raurica, reached a remarkable size, while hundreds of agricultural estates (Villae rusticae) were founded in the countryside. Around 260 AD, the fall of the Agri Decumates territory north of the Rhine transformed today's Switzerland into a frontier land of the Empire. Repeated raids by the Alamanni tribes provoked the ruin of the Roman towns and economy, forcing the population to find shelter near Roman fortresses, like the Castrum Rauracense near Augusta Raurica. The Empire built another line of defence at the north border (the so-called Donau-Iller-Rhine-Limes), but at the end of the fourth century the increased Germanic pressure forced the Romans to abandon the linear defence concept, and the Swiss plateau was finally open to the settlement of Germanic tribes. In the Early Middle Ages, from the end of the 4th century, the western extent of modern-day Switzerland was part of the territory of the Kings of the Burgundians. The Alemanni settled the Swiss plateau in the 5th century and the valleys of the Alps in the 8th century, forming Alemannia. Modern-day Switzerland was therefore then divided between the kingdoms of Alemannia and Burgundy.[35] The entire region became part of the expanding Frankish Empire in the 6th century, following Clovis I's victory over the Alemanni at Tolbiac in 504 AD, and later Frankish domination of the Burgundians.[37][38] Throughout the rest of the 6th, 7th and 8th centuries the Swiss regions continued under Frankish hegemony (Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties). But after its extension under Charlemagne, the Frankish Empire was divided by the Treaty of Verdun in 843.[35] The territories of present-day Switzerland became divided into Middle Francia and East Francia until they were reunified under the Holy Roman Empire around 1000 AD.[35] By 1200, the Swiss plateau comprised the dominions of the houses of Savoy, Zähringer, Habsburg, and Kyburg.[35] Some regions (Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, later known as Waldstätten) were accorded the Imperial immediacy to grant the empire direct control over the mountain passes. With the extinction of its male line in 1263, the Kyburg dynasty fell in AD 1264; then the Habsburgs under King Rudolph I (Holy Roman Emperor in 1273) laid claim to the Kyburg lands and annexed them extending their territory to the eastern Swiss plateau.[37] Old Swiss Confederacy Main article: Old Swiss Confederacy Further information: Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy, Reformation in Switzerland, and Early Modern Switzerland The Old Swiss Confederacy from 1291 (dark green) to the sixteenth century (light green) and its associates (blue). In the other colours shown are the subject territories. The Old Swiss Confederacy was an alliance among the valley communities of the central Alps. The Confederacy, governed by nobles and patricians of various cantons, facilitated management of common interests and ensured peace on the important mountain trade routes. The Federal Charter of 1291 agreed between the rural communes of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden is considered the confederacy's founding document, even though similar alliances are likely to have existed decades earlier.[39][40] By 1353, the three original cantons had joined with the cantons of Glarus and Zug and the Lucerne, Zürich and Bern city states to form the ""Old Confederacy"" of eight states that existed until the end of the 15th century. The expansion led to increased power and wealth for the confederation.[40] By 1460, the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the Rhine to the Alps and the Jura mountains, particularly after victories against the Habsburgs (Battle of Sempach, Battle of Näfels), over Charles the Bold of Burgundy during the 1470s, and the success of the Swiss mercenaries. The Swiss victory in the Swabian War against the Swabian League of Emperor Maximilian I in 1499 amounted to de facto independence within the Holy Roman Empire.[40] In 1501, Basel and Schaffhausen joined the Old Swiss Confederacy. The 1291 Bundesbrief (federal charter) The Old Swiss Confederacy had acquired a reputation of invincibility during these earlier wars, but expansion of the confederation suffered a setback in 1515 with the Swiss defeat in the Battle of Marignano. This ended the so-called ""heroic"" epoch of Swiss history.[40] The success of Zwingli's Reformation in some cantons led to inter-cantonal religious conflicts in 1529 and 1531 (Wars of Kappel). It was not until more than one hundred years after these internal wars that, in 1648, under the Peace of Westphalia, European countries recognised Switzerland's independence from the Holy Roman Empire and its neutrality.[37][38] During the Early Modern period of Swiss history, the growing authoritarianism of the patriciate families combined with a financial crisis in the wake of the Thirty Years' War led to the Swiss peasant war of 1653. In the background to this struggle, the conflict between Catholic and Protestant cantons persisted, erupting in further violence at the First War of Villmergen, in 1656, and the Toggenburg War (or Second War of Villmergen), in 1712.[40] Napoleonic era Main articles: Switzerland in the Napoleonic era, Helvetic Republic, and Act of Mediation The Act of Mediation was Napoleon's attempt at a compromise between the Ancien Régime and a Republic. In 1798, the revolutionary French government invaded Switzerland and imposed a new unified constitution.[40] This centralised the government of the country, effectively abolishing the cantons: moreover, Mülhausen joined France and the Valtellina valley became part of the Cisalpine Republic, separating from Switzerland. The new regime, known as the Helvetic Republic, was highly unpopular. It had been imposed by a foreign invading army and destroyed centuries of tradition, making Switzerland nothing more than a French satellite state. The fierce French suppression of the Nidwalden Revolt in September 1798 was an example of the oppressive presence of the French Army and the local population's resistance to the occupation. When war broke out between France and its rivals, Russian and Austrian forces invaded Switzerland. The Swiss refused to fight alongside the French in the name of the Helvetic Republic. In 1803 Napoleon organised a meeting of the leading Swiss politicians from both sides in Paris. The result was the Act of Mediation which largely restored Swiss autonomy and introduced a Confederation of 19 cantons.[40] Henceforth, much of Swiss politics would concern balancing the cantons' tradition of self-rule with the need for a central government. In 1815 the Congress of Vienna fully re-established Swiss independence and the European powers agreed to permanently recognise Swiss neutrality.[37][38][40] Swiss troops still served foreign governments until 1860 when they fought in the Siege of Gaeta. The treaty also allowed Switzerland to increase its territory, with the admission of the cantons of Valais, Neuchâtel and Geneva. Switzerland's borders have not changed since, except for some minor adjustments.[41] Federal state Main articles: Restoration and Regeneration (Switzerland) and Switzerland as a federal state The first Federal Palace in Bern (1857). One of the three cantons presiding over the Tagsatzung (former legislative and executive council), Bern was chosen as the permanent seat of federal legislative and executive institutions in 1848, in part because of its closeness to the French-speaking area.[1] The restoration of power to the patriciate was only temporary. After a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes, such as the Züriputsch of 1839, civil war (the Sonderbundskrieg) broke out in 1847 when some Catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance (the Sonderbund).[40] The war lasted for less than a month, causing fewer than 100 casualties, most of which were through friendly fire. Yet however minor the Sonderbundskrieg appears compared with other European riots and wars in the 19th century, it nevertheless had a major impact on both the psychology and the society of the Swiss and of Switzerland. The war convinced most Swiss of the need for unity and strength towards its European neighbours. Swiss people from all strata of society, whether Catholic or Protestant, from the liberal or conservative current, realised that the cantons would profit more if their economic and religious interests were merged. Thus, while the rest of Europe saw revolutionary uprisings, the Swiss drew up a constitution which provided for a federal layout, much of it inspired by the American example. This constitution provided for a central authority while leaving the cantons the right to self-government on local issues. Giving credit to those who favoured the power of the cantons (the Sonderbund Kantone), the national assembly was divided between an upper house (the Council of States, two representatives per canton) and a lower house (the National Council, with representatives elected from across the country). Referendums were made mandatory for any amendment of this constitution.[38] This new constitution also brought a legal end to nobility in Switzerland.[42] Inauguration in 1882 of the Gotthard Rail Tunnel connecting the southern canton of Ticino, the longest in the world at the time A system of single weights and measures was introduced and in 1850 the Swiss franc became the Swiss single currency, complemented by the WIR franc in 1934.[43] Article 11 of the constitution forbade sending troops to serve abroad, marking the end of foreign service. It came with the exception of serving the Holy See, and the Swiss were still obliged to serve Francis II of the Two Sicilies with Swiss Guards present at the Siege of Gaeta in 1860. An important clause of the constitution was that it could be re-written completely if this was deemed necessary, thus enabling it to evolve as a whole rather than being modified one amendment at a time.[44] This need soon proved itself when the rise in population and the Industrial Revolution that followed led to calls to modify the constitution accordingly. An early draft was rejected by the population in 1872 but modifications led to its acceptance in 1874.[40] It introduced the facultative referendum for laws at the federal level. It also established federal responsibility for defence, trade, and legal matters. In 1891, the constitution was revised with unusually strong elements of direct democracy, which remain unique even today.[40] Modern history Main articles: Switzerland during the World Wars and Modern history of Switzerland General Ulrich Wille, appointed commander-in-chief of the Swiss Army for the duration of World War I Switzerland was not invaded during either of the world wars. During World War I, Switzerland was home to the revolutionary and founder of the Soviet Union Vladimir Illych Ulyanov (Vladimir Lenin) and he remained there until 1917.[45] Swiss neutrality was seriously questioned by the Grimm–Hoffmann affair in 1917, but that was short-lived. In 1920, Switzerland joined the League of Nations, which was based in Geneva, on condition that it was exempt from any military requirements. During World War II, detailed invasion plans were drawn up by the Germans,[46] but Switzerland was never attacked.[40] Switzerland was able to remain independent through a combination of military deterrence, concessions to Germany, and good fortune as larger events during the war delayed an invasion.[38][47] Under General Henri Guisan, appointed the commander-in-chief for the duration of the war, a general mobilisation of the armed forces was ordered. The Swiss military strategy was changed from one of static defence at the borders to protect the economic heartland, to one of organised long-term attrition and withdrawal to strong, well-stockpiled positions high in the Alps known as the Reduit. Switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the Axis and Allied powers.[47] Switzerland's trade was blockaded by both the Allies and by the Axis. Economic cooperation and extension of credit to the Third Reich varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion and the availability of other trading partners. Concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through Vichy France was severed in 1942, leaving Switzerland (together with Liechtenstein) entirely isolated from the wider world by Axis controlled territory. Over the course of the war, Switzerland interned over 300,000 refugees[48] and the International Red Cross, based in Geneva, played an important part during the conflict. Strict immigration and asylum policies as well as the financial relationships with Nazi Germany raised controversy, but not until the end of the 20th century.[49] During the war, the Swiss Air Force engaged aircraft of both sides, shooting down 11 intruding Luftwaffe planes in May and June 1940, then forcing down other intruders after a change of policy following threats from Germany. Over 100 Allied bombers and their crews were interned during the war. Between 1940 and 1945, Switzerland was bombed by the Allies causing fatalities and property damage.[47] Among the cities and towns bombed were Basel, Brusio, Chiasso, Cornol, Geneva, Koblenz, Niederweningen, Rafz, Renens, Samedan, Schaffhausen, Stein am Rhein, Tägerwilen, Thayngen, Vals, and Zürich. Allied forces explained the bombings, which violated the 96th Article of War, resulted from navigation errors, equipment failure, weather conditions, and errors made by bomber pilots. The Swiss expressed fear and concern that the bombings were intended to put pressure on Switzerland to end economic cooperation and neutrality with Nazi Germany.[50] Court-martial proceedings took place in England and the U.S. Government paid 62,176,433.06 in Swiss francs for reparations of the bombings. Switzerland's attitude towards refugees was complicated and controversial; over the course of the war it admitted as many as 300,000 refugees[48] while refusing tens of thousands more,[51] including Jews who were severely persecuted by the Nazis. After the war, the Swiss government exported credits through the charitable fund known as the Schweizerspende and also donated to the Marshall Plan to help Europe's recovery, efforts that ultimately benefited the Swiss economy.[52] During the Cold War, Swiss authorities considered the construction of a Swiss nuclear bomb.[53] Leading nuclear physicists at the Federal Institute of Technology Zürich such as Paul Scherrer made this a realistic possibility. In 1988, the Paul Scherrer Institute was founded in his name to explore the therapeutic uses of neutron scattering technologies. Financial problems with the defence budget and ethical considerations prevented the substantial funds from being allocated, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 was seen as a valid alternative. All remaining plans for building nuclear weapons were dropped by 1988.[54] In 2003, by granting the Swiss People's Party a second seat in the governing cabinet, the Parliament altered the coalition that had dominated Swiss politics since 1959. Switzerland was the last Western republic to grant women the right to vote. Some Swiss cantons approved this in 1959, while at the federal level it was achieved in 1971[40][55] and, after resistance, in the last canton Appenzell Innerrhoden (one of only two remaining Landsgemeinde, along with Glarus) in 1990. After obtaining suffrage at the federal level, women quickly rose in political significance, with the first woman on the seven-member Federal Council executive being Elisabeth Kopp, who served from 1984 to 1989,[40] and the first female president being Ruth Dreifuss in 1999. Switzerland joined the Council of Europe in 1963.[38] In 1979 areas from the canton of Bern attained independence from the Bernese, forming the new canton of Jura. On 18 April 1999 the Swiss population and the cantons voted in favour of a completely revised federal constitution.[40] In 2002 Switzerland became a full member of the United Nations, leaving the Vatican City as the last widely recognised state without full UN membership. Switzerland is a founding member of the EFTA but is not a member of the European Economic Area. An application for membership in the European Union was sent in May 1992, but not advanced since the EEA was rejected in December 1992[40] when Switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the EEA. There have since been several referendums on the EU issue; due to opposition from the citizens, the membership application has been withdrawn. Nonetheless, Swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the EU, and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the European Union. Switzerland, together with Liechtenstein, has been completely surrounded by the EU since Austria's entry in 1995. On 5 June 2005, Swiss voters agreed by a 55% majority to join the Schengen treaty, a result that was regarded by EU commentators as a sign of support by Switzerland, a country that is traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter supranational bodies.[38] In September 2020, a referendum calling for a vote on end to the pact that allowed a free movement of people from the European Union was introduced by the Swiss People's Party (SPP).[56] However, the voters rejected the attempts of taking back control of immigration, defeating the motion by a roughly 63%–37% margin.[57] Geography Main article: Geography of Switzerland Physical map of Switzerland (in German) Extending across the north and south side of the Alps in west-central Europe, Switzerland encompasses a great diversity of landscapes and climates on a limited area of 41,285 square kilometres (15,940 sq mi).[58] The population is about 8.7 million (2020 est.).[59] The average population density in 2019 was 215.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (557/sq mi).[60]:79 In the largest canton by area, Graubünden, lying entirely in the Alps, population density falls to 28.0 inhabitants per square kilometre (73/sq mi).[60]:30 In the canton of Zürich, with its large urban capital, the density is 926.8 per square kilometre (2,400/sq mi).[60]:76 Switzerland lies between latitudes 45° and 48° N, and longitudes 5° and 11° E. It contains three basic topographical areas: the Swiss Alps to the south, the Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau, and the Jura mountains on the west. The Alps are a high mountain range running across the central-south of the country, constituting about 60% of the country's total area. The majority of the Swiss population live in the Swiss Plateau. Among the high valleys of the Swiss Alps, many glaciers are found, totalling an area of 1,063 square kilometres (410 sq mi). From these originate the headwaters of several major rivers, such as the Rhine, Inn, Ticino and Rhône, which flow in the four cardinal directions into the whole of Europe. The hydrographic network includes several of the largest bodies of freshwater in Central and Western Europe, among which are included Lake Geneva (also called le Lac Léman in French), Lake Constance (known as Bodensee in German) and Lake Maggiore. Switzerland has more than 1500 lakes and contains 6% of Europe's stock of fresh water. Lakes and glaciers cover about 6% of the national territory. The largest lake is Lake Geneva, in western Switzerland shared with France. The Rhône is both the main source and outflow of Lake Geneva. Lake Constance is the second-largest Swiss lake and, like Lake Geneva, an intermediate step by the Rhine at the border to Austria and Germany. While the Rhône flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the French Camargue region and the Rhine flows into the North Sea at Rotterdam in the Netherlands, about 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) apart, both springs are only about 22 kilometres (14 miles) apart from each other in the Swiss Alps.[58][61] Contrasted landscapes between the regions of the Matterhorn and Lake Lucerne Forty-eight of Switzerland's mountains are 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) above sea in altitude or higher.[58] At 4,634 m (15,203 ft), Monte Rosa is the highest, although the Matterhorn (4,478 m or 14,692 ft) is often regarded as the most famous. Both are located within the Pennine Alps in the canton of Valais, on the border with Italy. The section of the Bernese Alps above the deep glacial Lauterbrunnen valley, containing 72 waterfalls, is well known for the Jungfrau (4,158 m or 13,642 ft) Eiger and Mönch, and the many picturesque valleys in the region. In the southeast the long Engadin Valley, encompassing the St. Moritz area in canton of Graubünden, is also well known; the highest peak in the neighbouring Bernina Alps is Piz Bernina (4,049 m or 13,284 ft).[58] The more populous northern part of the country, constituting about 30% of the country's total area, is called the Swiss Plateau. It has greater open and hilly landscapes, partly forested, partly open pastures, usually with grazing herds, or vegetables and fruit fields, but it is still hilly. There are large lakes found here and the biggest Swiss cities are in this area of the country.[58] Within Switzerland there are two small enclaves: Büsingen belongs to Germany, Campione d'Italia belongs to Italy.[62] Switzerland has no exclaves in other countries. Climate Köppen-Geiger climate classification map for Switzerland The Swiss climate is generally temperate, but can vary greatly between the localities,[63] from glacial conditions on the mountaintops to the often pleasant near Mediterranean climate at Switzerland's southern tip. There are some valley areas in the southern part of Switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found. Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing. The less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks, while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion, during these periods, thus seeing no sun for weeks. A weather phenomenon known as the föhn (with an identical effect to the chinook wind) can occur at all times of the year and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind, bringing air of very low relative humidity to the north of the Alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the Alps. This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south. Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect. The driest conditions persist in all inner alpine valleys that receive less rain because arriving clouds lose a lot of their content while crossing the mountains before reaching these areas. Large alpine areas such as Graubünden remain drier than pre-alpine areas and as in the main valley of the Valais wine grapes are grown there.[64] The wettest conditions persist in the high Alps and in the Ticino canton which has much sun yet heavy bursts of rain from time to time.[64] Precipitation tends to be spread moderately throughout the year with a peak in summer. Autumn is the driest season, winter receives less precipitation than summer, yet the weather patterns in Switzerland are not in a stable climate system and can be variable from year to year with no strict and predictable periods. Environment Switzerland contains two terrestrial ecoregions: Western European broadleaf forests and Alps conifer and mixed forests.[65] Switzerland's ecosystems can be particularly fragile, because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies. The mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable, with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes, and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing. The climatic, geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change.[63][66] Nevertheless, according to the 2014 Environmental Performance Index, Switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment, due to its high scores on environmental public health, its heavy reliance on renewable sources of energy (hydropower and geothermal energy), and its control of greenhouse gas emissions.[67] In 2020 it was ranked third out of 180 countries.[68] The country pledged to cut GHG emissions by 50% by the year 2030 compared to the level of 1990 and works on a plan to reach zero emissions by 2050.[69] However, access to biocapacity in Switzerland is far lower than world average. In 2016, Switzerland had 1.0 global hectares[70] of biocapacity per person within its territory, 40 percent less than world average of 1.6 global hectares per person. In contrast, in 2016, they used 4.6 global hectares of biocapacity - their ecological footprint of consumption. This means they used about 4.6 times as much biocapacity as Switzerland contains. The remainder comes from imports and overusing the global commons (such as the atmosphere through greenhouse gas emissions). As a result, Switzerland is running a biocapacity deficit.[70] Switzerland had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 3.53/10, ranking it 150th globally out of 172 countries.[71] Politics Main article: Politics of Switzerland The Swiss Federal Council in 2016 with President Johann Schneider-Ammann (front, centre)[note 7] The Federal Constitution adopted in 1848 is the legal foundation of the modern federal state.[72] A new Swiss Constitution was adopted in 1999, but did not introduce notable changes to the federal structure. It outlines basic and political rights of individuals and citizen participation in public affairs, divides the powers between the Confederation and the cantons and defines federal jurisdiction and authority. There are three main governing bodies on the federal level:[73] the bicameral parliament (legislative), the Federal Council (executive) and the Federal Court (judicial). The Federal Palace, seat of the Federal Assembly and the Federal Council The Swiss Parliament consists of two houses: the Council of States which has 46 representatives (two from each canton and one from each half-canton) who are elected under a system determined by each canton, and the National Council, which consists of 200 members who are elected under a system of proportional representation, depending on the population of each canton. Members of both houses serve for 4 years and only serve as members of parliament part-time (so-called Milizsystem or citizen legislature).[74] When both houses are in joint session, they are known collectively as the Federal Assembly. Through referendums, citizens may challenge any law passed by parliament and through initiatives, introduce amendments to the federal constitution, thus making Switzerland a direct democracy.[72] The Federal Council constitutes the federal government, directs the federal administration and serves as collective Head of State. It is a collegial body of seven members, elected for a four-year mandate by the Federal Assembly which also exercises oversight over the council. The President of the Confederation is elected by the Assembly from among the seven members, traditionally in rotation and for a one-year term; the President chairs the government and assumes representative functions. However, the president is a primus inter pares with no additional powers, and remains the head of a department within the administration.[72] The Swiss government has been a coalition of the four major political parties since 1959, each party having a number of seats that roughly reflects its share of electorate and representation in the federal parliament. The classic distribution of 2 CVP/PDC, 2 SPS/PSS, 2 FDP/PRD and 1 SVP/UDC as it stood from 1959 to 2003 was known as the ""magic formula"". Following the 2015 Federal Council elections, the seven seats in the Federal Council were distributed as follows: 1 seat for the Christian Democratic People's Party (CVP/PDC), 2 seats for the Free Democratic Party (FDP/PRD), 2 seats for the Social Democratic Party (SPS/PSS), 2 seats for the Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC). The function of the Federal Supreme Court is to hear appeals against rulings of cantonal or federal courts. The judges are elected by the Federal Assembly for six-year terms.[75] Direct democracy Main article: Voting in Switzerland The Landsgemeinde is an old form of direct democracy, still in practice in two cantons. Direct democracy and federalism are hallmarks of the Swiss political system.[76] Swiss citizens are subject to three legal jurisdictions: the municipality, canton and federal levels. The 1848 and 1999 Swiss Constitutions define a system of direct democracy (sometimes called half-direct or representative direct democracy because it is aided by the more commonplace institutions of a representative democracy). The instruments of this system at the federal level, known as popular rights (German: Volksrechte, French: droits populaires, Italian: diritti popolari),[77] include the right to submit a federal initiative and a referendum, both of which may overturn parliamentary decisions.[72][78] By calling a federal referendum, a group of citizens may challenge a law passed by parliament, if they gather 50,000 signatures against the law within 100 days. If so, a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by a simple majority whether to accept or reject the law. Any 8 cantons together can also call a constitutional referendum on a federal law.[72] Similarly, the federal constitutional initiative allows citizens to put a constitutional amendment to a national vote, if 100,000 voters sign the proposed amendment within 18 months.[note 8] The Federal Council and the Federal Assembly can supplement the proposed amendment with a counter-proposal, and then voters must indicate a preference on the ballot in case both proposals are accepted. Constitutional amendments, whether introduced by initiative or in parliament, must be accepted by a double majority of the national popular vote and the cantonal popular votes.[note 9][76] Cantons Main article: Cantons of Switzerland The Swiss Confederation consists of 26 cantons:[72][79] Canton ID Capital Canton ID Capital Aargau 19 Aarau *Nidwalden 7 Stans *Appenzell Ausserrhoden 15 Herisau *Obwalden 6 Sarnen *Appenzell Innerrhoden 16 Appenzell Schaffhausen 14 Schaffhausen *Basel-Landschaft 13 Liestal Schwyz 5 Schwyz *Basel-Stadt 12 Basel Solothurn 11 Solothurn Bern 2 Bern St. Gallen 17 St. Gallen Fribourg 10 Fribourg Thurgau 20 Frauenfeld Geneva 25 Geneva Ticino 21 Bellinzona Glarus 8 Glarus Uri 4 Altdorf Grisons 18 Chur Valais 23 Sion Jura 26 Delémont Vaud 22 Lausanne Lucerne 3 Lucerne Zug 9 Zug Neuchâtel 24 Neuchâtel Zürich 1 Zürich *These cantons are known as half-cantons. The cantons are federated states, have a permanent constitutional status and, in comparison with the situation in other countries, a high degree of independence. Under the Federal Constitution, all 26 cantons are equal in status, except that 6 (referred to often as the half-cantons) are represented by only one councillor (instead of two) in the Council of States and have only half a cantonal vote with respect to the required cantonal majority in referendums on constitutional amendments. Each canton has its own constitution, and its own parliament, government, police and courts.[79] However, there are considerable differences between the individual cantons, most particularly in terms of population and geographical area. Their populations vary between 16,003 (Appenzell Innerrhoden) and 1,487,969 (Zürich), and their area between 37 km2 (14 sq mi) (Basel-Stadt) and 7,105 km2 (2,743 sq mi) (Grisons). Municipalities Main article: Municipalities of Switzerland The cantons comprise a total of 2,222 municipalities as of 2018. Foreign relations and international institutions Main article: Foreign relations of Switzerland Traditionally, Switzerland avoids alliances that might entail military, political, or direct economic action and has been neutral since the end of its expansion in 1515. Its policy of neutrality was internationally recognised at the Congress of Vienna in 1815.[80][81] Only in 2002 did Switzerland become a full member of the United Nations[80] and it was the first state to join it by referendum. Switzerland maintains diplomatic relations with almost all countries and historically has served as an intermediary between other states.[80] Switzerland is not a member of the European Union; the Swiss people have consistently rejected membership since the early 1990s.[80] However, Switzerland does participate in the Schengen Area.[82] Swiss neutrality has been questioned at times.[83][84][85][86][87] The monochromatically reversed Swiss flag became the symbol of the Red Cross Movement,[55] founded in 1863 by Henry Dunant.[88] Many international institutions have their seats in Switzerland, in part because of its policy of neutrality. Geneva is the birthplace of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the Geneva Conventions and, since 2006, hosts the United Nations Human Rights Council. Even though Switzerland is one of the most recent countries to have joined the United Nations, the Palace of Nations in Geneva is the second biggest centre for the United Nations after New York, and Switzerland was a founding member and home to the League of Nations. Apart from the United Nations headquarters, the Swiss Confederation is host to many UN agencies, like the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and about 200 other international organisations, including the World Trade Organization and the World Intellectual Property Organization.[80] The annual meetings of the World Economic Forum in Davos bring together top international business and political leaders from Switzerland and foreign countries to discuss important issues facing the world, including health and the environment. Additionally the headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) are located in Basel since 1930. Furthermore, many sports federations and organisations are located throughout the country, such as the International Handball Federation in Basel, the International Basketball Federation in Geneva, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) in Nyon, the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) and the International Ice Hockey Federation both in Zürich, the International Cycling Union in Aigle, and the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne.[89] Military Main articles: Swiss Armed Forces and Pontifical Swiss Guard A Swiss Air Force F/A-18 Hornet at Axalp Air Show The Swiss Armed Forces, including the Land Forces and the Air Force, are composed mostly of conscripts, male citizens aged from 20 to 34 (in special cases up to 50) years. Being a landlocked country, Switzerland has no navy; however, on lakes bordering neighbouring countries, armed military patrol boats are used. Swiss citizens are prohibited from serving in foreign armies, except for the Swiss Guards of the Vatican, or if they are dual citizens of a foreign country and reside there. The structure of the Swiss militia system stipulates that the soldiers keep their Army issued equipment, including all personal weapons, at home. Some organisations and political parties find this practice controversial.[90] Women can serve voluntarily. Men usually receive military conscription orders for training at the age of 18.[91] About two thirds of the young Swiss are found suited for service; for those found unsuited, various forms of alternative service exist.[92] Annually, approximately 20,000 persons are trained in recruit centres for a duration from 18 to 21 weeks. The reform ""Army XXI"" was adopted by popular vote in 2003, it replaced the previous model ""Army 95"", reducing the effectiveness from 400,000 to about 200,000. Of those, 120,000 are active in periodic Army training and 80,000 are non-training reserves.[93] The newest reform of the military, WEA/DEVA/USEs, started in 2019 and will reduce the number of army personnel progressively to 100,000 by the end of 2022.[94] Swiss-built Mowag Eagles of the Land Forces Overall, three general mobilisations have been declared to ensure the integrity and neutrality of Switzerland. The first one was held on the occasion of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. The second was in response to the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. The third mobilisation of the army took place in September 1939 in response to the German attack on Poland; Henri Guisan was elected as the General-in-Chief. Because of its neutrality policy, the Swiss army does not currently take part in armed conflicts in other countries but is part of some peacekeeping missions around the world. Since 2000 the armed force department has also maintained the Onyx intelligence gathering system to monitor satellite communications.[95] Gun politics in Switzerland are unique in Europe in that 2–3.5 million guns are in the hands of civilians, giving the nation an estimate of 27.6–41.2 guns per 100 people.[96] It is worth noting that as per Small Arms Survey, only 324,484 guns are owned by the military on top of the civilian-owned ones,[97] but that only 143,372 are in the hands of soldiers as per Army numbers.[98] However, ammunition is no longer issued.[99][100] The capital or Federal City issue Until 1848 the rather loosely coupled Confederation did not know a central political organisation, but representatives, mayors, and Landammänner met several times a year at the capital of the Lieu presiding the Confederal Diet for one year. The Old City of Bern Until 1500 the legates met most of the time in Lucerne, but also in Zürich, Baden, Bern, Schwyz etc., but sometimes also at places outside of the confederation, such as Constance. From the Swabian War in 1499 onwards until Reformation, most conferences met in Zurich. Afterwards, the town hall at Baden, where the annual accounts of the common people had been held regularly since 1426, became the most frequent, but not the sole place of assembly. After 1712 Frauenfeld gradually dissolved Baden. From 1526, the Catholic conferences were held mostly in Lucerne, the Protestant conferences from 1528 mostly in Aarau, the one for the legitimation of the French Ambassador in Solothurn. At the same time the syndicate for the Ennetbirgischen Vogteien located in the present Ticino met from 1513 in Lugano and Locarno.[101] After the Helvetic Republic and during the Mediation from 1803 until 1815 the Confederal Diet of the 19 Lieus met at the capitals of the directoral cantons Fribourg, Berne, Basel, Zurich, Lucerne and Solothurn.[101] After the Long Diet from 6 April 1814 to 31 August 1815 took place in Zurich to replace the constitution and the enhancement of the Confederation to 22 cantons by the admission of the cantons of Valais, Neuchâtel and Geneva to full members, the directorial cantons of Lucerne, Zurich and Berne took over the diet in two-year turns.[101] In 1848, the federal constitution provided that details concerning the federal institutions, such as their locations, should be taken care of by the Federal Assembly (BV 1848 Art. 108). Thus on 28 November 1848, the Federal Assembly voted in majority to locate the seat of government in Berne. And, as a prototypical federal compromise, to assign other federal institutions, such as the Federal Polytechnical School (1854, the later ETH) to Zurich, and other institutions to Lucerne, such as the later SUVA (1912) and the Federal Insurance Court (1917). In 1875, a law (RS 112) fixed the compensations owed by the city of Bern for the federal seat.[1] According to these living fundamental federalistic feelings further federal institutions were subsequently attributed to Lausanne (Federal Supreme Court in 1872, and EPFL in 1969), Bellinzona (Federal Criminal Court, 2004), and St. Gallen (Federal Administrative Court and Federal Patent Court, 2012). The 1999 new constitution, however, does not contain anything concerning any Federal City. In 2002 a tripartite committee has been asked by the Swiss Federal Council to prepare the ""creation of a federal law on the status of Bern as a Federal City"", and to evaluate the positive and negative aspects for the city and the canton of Bern if this status were awarded. After a first report, the work of this committee was suspended in 2004 by the Swiss Federal Council, and work on this subject has not resumed since.[102] Thus as of today, no city in Switzerland has the official status either of capital or of Federal City, nevertheless, Bern is commonly referred to as ""Federal City"" (German: Bundesstadt, French: ville fédérale, Italian: città federale). Economy and labour law Main article: Economy of Switzerland See also: Banking in Switzerland, Taxation in Switzerland, and Federal budget of Switzerland The city of Basel (Roche Tower) is the capital of the country's pharmaceutical industry, which accounts for around 38% of Swiss exports worldwide.[103] The Greater Zürich area, home to 1.5 million inhabitants and 150,000 companies, is one of the most important economic centres in the world.[104] The Omega Speedmaster worn on the moon during the Apollo missions. In terms of value, Switzerland is responsible for half of the world production of watches.[55][105] Origin of the capital at the 30 biggest Swiss corporations, 2018[106] Switzerland (39%)  North America (33%)  Europe (24%)  Rest of the world (4%) Switzerland has a stable, prosperous and high-tech economy and enjoys great wealth, being ranked as the wealthiest country in the world per capita in multiple rankings. The country has been ranked as one of the least corrupt countries in the world,[107][108][109] while its banking sector has been rated as ""one of the most corrupt in the world"".[110] It has the world's twentieth largest economy by nominal GDP and the thirty-eighth largest by purchasing power parity. It is the seventeenth largest exporter. Zürich and Geneva are regarded as global cities, ranked as Alpha and Beta respectively. Basel is the capital of the pharmaceutical industry in Switzerland. With its world-class companies, Novartis and Roche, and many other players, it is also one of the world's most important centres for the life sciences industry.[111] Switzerland has the highest European rating in the Index of Economic Freedom 2010, while also providing large coverage through public services.[112] The nominal per capita GDP is higher than those of the larger Western and Central European economies and Japan.[113] In terms of GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power, Switzerland was ranked 5th in the world in 2018 by World Bank[114] and estimated at 9th by the IMF in 2020,[115] as well as 11th by the CIA World Factbook in 2017.[116] The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report currently ranks Switzerland's economy as the most competitive in the world,[117] it is ranked by the European Union as Europe's most innovative country and as the most innovative country in the Global Innovation Index in 2020.[118][119][120] It is a relatively easy place to do business, currently ranking 20th of 189 countries in the Ease of Doing Business Index. The slow growth Switzerland experienced in the 1990s and the early 2000s has brought greater support for economic reforms and harmonisation with the European Union.[121][122] For much of the 20th century, Switzerland was the wealthiest country in Europe by a considerable margin (by GDP – per capita).[123] Switzerland also has one of the world's largest account balances as a percentage of GDP.[124] In 2018, the canton of Basel-City had the highest GDP per capita in the country, ahead of the cantons of Zug and Geneva.[125] According to Credit Suisse, only about 37% of residents own their own homes, one of the lowest rates of home ownership in Europe. Housing and food price levels were 171% and 145% of the EU-25 index in 2007, compared to 113% and 104% in Germany.[126] Switzerland is home to several large multinational corporations. The largest Swiss companies by revenue are Glencore, Gunvor, Nestlé, Mediterranean Shipping Company, Novartis, Hoffmann-La Roche, ABB, Mercuria Energy Group and Adecco.[127] Also, notable are UBS AG, Zurich Financial Services, Richemont, Credit Suisse, Barry Callebaut, Swiss Re, Rolex, Tetra Pak, The Swatch Group and Swiss International Air Lines. Switzerland is ranked as having one of the most powerful economies in the world.[123][dubious – discuss] Switzerland's most important economic sector is manufacturing. Manufacturing consists largely of the production of specialist chemicals, health and pharmaceutical goods, scientific and precision measuring instruments and musical instruments. The largest exported goods are chemicals (34% of exported goods), machines/electronics (20.9%), and precision instruments/watches (16.9%).[126] Exported services amount to a third of exports.[126] The service sector – especially banking and insurance, tourism, and international organisations – is another important industry for Switzerland. The high valley of Engadine. Tourism constitutes an important revenue for the less industrialised alpine regions.Agricultural protectionism—a rare exception to Switzerland's free trade policies—has contributed to high food prices. Product market liberalisation is lagging behind many EU countries according to the OECD.[121] Nevertheless, domestic purchasing power is one of the best in the world.[128][129][130] Apart from agriculture, economic and trade barriers between the European Union and Switzerland are minimal and Switzerland has free trade agreements worldwide. Switzerland is a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). Taxation and government spending Switzerland has an overwhelmingly private sector economy and low tax rates by Western World standards; overall taxation is one of the smallest of developed countries. The Swiss Federal budget had a size of 62.8 billion Swiss francs in 2010, which is an equivalent 11.35% of the country's GDP in that year; however, the regional (canton) budgets and the budgets of the municipalities are not counted as part of the federal budget and the total rate of government spending is closer to 33.8% of GDP. The main sources of income for the federal government are the value-added tax (accounting for 33% of tax revenue) and the direct federal tax (29%), with the main areas of expenditure in social welfare and finance/taxes. The expenditures of the Swiss Confederation have been growing from 7% of GDP in 1960 to 9.7% in 1990 and to 10.7% in 2010. While the sectors social welfare and finance & tax have been growing from 35% in 1990 to 48.2% in 2010, a significant reduction of expenditures has been occurring in the sectors of agriculture and national defence; from 26.5% in to 12.4% (estimation for the year 2015).[131][132] Labour market Slightly more than 5 million people work in Switzerland;[133] about 25% of employees belonged to a trade union in 2004.[134] Switzerland has a more flexible job market than neighbouring countries and the unemployment rate is very low. The unemployment rate increased from a low of 1.7% in June 2000 to a peak of 4.4% in December 2009.[135] The unemployment rate decreased to 3.2% in 2014 and held steady at that level for several years,[136] before further dropping to 2.5% in 2018 and 2.3% in 2019.[137] Population growth from net immigration is quite high, at 0.52% of population in 2004, increased in the following years before falling to 0.54% again in 2017.[126][138] The foreign citizen population was 28.9% in 2015, about the same as in Australia. GDP per hour worked is the world's 16th highest, at 49.46 international dollars in 2012.[139] In 2016, the median monthly gross salary in Switzerland was 6,502 francs per month (equivalent to US$6,597 per month), is just enough to cover the high cost of living. After rent, taxes and social security contributions, plus spending on goods and services, the average household has about 15% of its gross income left for savings. Though 61% of the population made less than the average income, income inequality is relatively low with a Gini coefficient of 29.7, placing Switzerland among the top 20 countries for income equality. About 8.2% of the population live below the national poverty line, defined in Switzerland as earning less than CHF3,990 per month for a household of two adults and two children, and a further 15% are at risk of poverty. Single-parent families, those with no post-compulsory education and those who are out of work are among the most likely to be living below the poverty line. Although getting a job is considered a way out of poverty, among the gainfully employed, some 4.3% are considered working poor. One in ten jobs in Switzerland is considered low-paid and roughly 12% of Swiss workers hold such jobs, many of them women and foreigners. Education and science The University of Basel is Switzerland's oldest university (1460). Main articles: Education in Switzerland and Science and technology in Switzerland Some Swiss scientists who played a key role in their discipline (clockwise):Leonhard Euler (mathematics)Louis Agassiz (glaciology)Auguste Piccard (aeronautics)Albert Einstein (physics) Education in Switzerland is very diverse because the constitution of Switzerland delegates the authority for the school system to the cantons.[140] There are both public and private schools, including many private international schools. The minimum age for primary school is about six years in all cantons, but most cantons provide a free ""children's school"" starting at four or five years old.[140] Primary school continues until grade four, five or six, depending on the school. Traditionally, the first foreign language in school was always one of the other national languages, although in 2000 English was introduced first in a few cantons.[140]At the end of primary school (or at the beginning of secondary school), pupils are separated according to their capacities in several (often three) sections. The fastest learners are taught advanced classes to be prepared for further studies and the matura,[140] while students who assimilate a little more slowly receive an education more adapted to their needs. There are 12 universities in Switzerland, ten of which are maintained at cantonal level and usually offer a range of non-technical subjects. The first university in Switzerland was founded in 1460 in Basel (with a faculty of medicine) and has a tradition of chemical and medical research in Switzerland. It is listed 87th on the 2019 Academic Ranking of World Universities.[141] The largest university in Switzerland is the University of Zurich with nearly 25,000 students.[citation needed] The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETHZ) and the University of Zurich are listed 20th and 54th respectively, on the 2015 Academic Ranking of World Universities.[142][143][144] The two institutes sponsored by the federal government are the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETHZ) in Zürich, founded 1855 and the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Lausanne, founded 1969 as such, which was formerly an institute associated with the University of Lausanne.[note 10][145][146] Eight of ten best hotel schools in the world are located in Switzerland.[147] In addition, there are various Universities of Applied Sciences. In business and management studies, the University of St. Gallen, (HSG) is ranked 329th in the world according to QS World University Rankings[148] and the International Institute for Management Development (IMD), was ranked first in open programmes worldwide by the Financial Times.[149] Switzerland has the second highest rate (almost 18% in 2003) of foreign students in tertiary education, after Australia (slightly over 18%).[150][151] As might befit a country that plays home to innumerable international organisations, the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, located in Geneva, is not only continental Europe's oldest graduate school of international and development studies, but also widely believed to be one of its most prestigious.[152][153] Many Nobel Prize laureates have been Swiss scientists. They include the world-famous physicist Albert Einstein[154] in the field of physics, who developed his special relativity while working in Bern. More recently Vladimir Prelog, Heinrich Rohrer, Richard Ernst, Edmond Fischer, Rolf Zinkernagel, Kurt Wüthrich and Jacques Dubochet received Nobel Prizes in the sciences. In total, 114 Nobel Prize winners in all fields stand in relation to Switzerland[155][note 11] and the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded nine times to organisations residing in Switzerland.[156] The LHC tunnel. CERN is the world's largest laboratory and also the birthplace of the World Wide Web.[157] Geneva and the nearby French department of Ain co-host the world's largest laboratory, CERN,[158] dedicated to particle physics research. Another important research centre is the Paul Scherrer Institute. Notable inventions include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), diazepam (Valium), the scanning tunnelling microscope (Nobel prize) and Velcro. Some technologies enabled the exploration of new worlds such as the pressurised balloon of Auguste Piccard and the Bathyscaphe which permitted Jacques Piccard to reach the deepest point of the world's oceans. Switzerland Space Agency, the Swiss Space Office, has been involved in various space technologies and programmes. In addition it was one of the 10 founders of the European Space Agency in 1975 and is the seventh largest contributor to the ESA budget. In the private sector, several companies are implicated in the space industry such as Oerlikon Space[159] or Maxon Motors[160] who provide spacecraft structures. Switzerland and the European Union Main article: Switzerland–European Union relations Switzerland voted against membership in the European Economic Area in a referendum in December 1992 and has since maintained and developed its relationships with the European Union (EU) and European countries through bilateral agreements. In March 2001, the Swiss people refused in a popular vote to start accession negotiations with the EU.[161] In recent years, the Swiss have brought their economic practices largely into conformity with those of the EU in many ways, in an effort to enhance their international competitiveness. The economy grew at 3% in 2010, 1.9% in 2011, and 1% in 2012.[162] EU membership was a long-term objective of the Swiss government, but there was and remains considerable popular sentiment against membership, which is opposed by the conservative SVP party, the largest party in the National Council, and not currently supported or proposed by several other political parties. The application for membership of the EU was formally withdrawn in 2016, having long been frozen. The western French-speaking areas and the urban regions of the rest of the country tend to be more pro-EU, nonetheless with far from a significant share of the population.[163][164] Members of the European Free Trade Association (green) participate in the European Single Market and are part of the Schengen Area. The government has established an Integration Office under the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Economic Affairs. To minimise the negative consequences of Switzerland's isolation from the rest of Europe, Bern and Brussels signed seven bilateral agreements to further liberalise trade ties. These agreements were signed in 1999 and took effect in 2001. This first series of bilateral agreements included the free movement of persons. A second series covering nine areas was signed in 2004 and has since been ratified, which includes the Schengen Treaty and the Dublin Convention besides others.[165] They continue to discuss further areas for cooperation.[166] In 2006, Switzerland approved 1 billion francs of supportive investment in the poorer Southern and Central European countries in support of cooperation and positive ties to the EU as a whole. A further referendum will be needed to approve 300 million francs to support Romania and Bulgaria and their recent admission. The Swiss have also been under EU and sometimes international pressure to reduce banking secrecy and to raise tax rates to parity with the EU. Preparatory discussions are being opened in four new areas: opening up the electricity market, participation in the European GNSS project Galileo, cooperating with the European centre for disease prevention and recognising certificates of origin for food products.[167] On 27 November 2008, the interior and justice ministers of the European Union in Brussels announced Switzerland's accession to the Schengen passport-free zone from 12 December 2008. The land border checkpoints will remain in place only for goods movements, but should not run controls on people, though people entering the country had their passports checked until 29 March 2009 if they originated from a Schengen nation.[168] On 9 February 2014, Swiss voters narrowly approved by 50.3% a ballot initiative launched by the national conservative Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC) to restrict immigration, and thus reintroducing a quota system on the influx of foreigners. This initiative was mostly backed by rural (57.6% approvals) and suburban agglomerations (51.2% approvals), and isolated towns (51.3% approvals) as well as by a strong majority (69.2% approval) in the canton of Ticino, while metropolitan centres (58.5% rejection) and the French-speaking part (58.5% rejection) rather rejected it.[169] Some news commentators claim that this proposal de facto contradicts the bilateral agreements on the free movement of persons from these respective countries.[170][171] In December 2016, a political compromise with the European Union was attained effectively canceling quotas on EU citizens but still allowing for favourable treatment of Swiss-based job applicants.[172] On 27 September 2020, Swiss voters clearly rejected the anti-free movement popular initiative by the conservative Swiss People's Party (SVP) with nearly 62% ""no"" votes, reflecting democratic support for bilateral agreements with the European Union.[173] Energy, infrastructure and environment See also: Energy in Switzerland, Transport in Switzerland, Waste management in Switzerland, and Environment of Switzerland Switzerland has the tallest dams in Europe, among which the Mauvoisin Dam, in the Alps. Hydroelectricity is the most important domestic source of energy in the country. Electricity generated in Switzerland is 56% from hydroelectricity and 39% from nuclear power, resulting in a nearly CO2-free electricity-generating network. On 18 May 2003, two anti-nuclear initiatives were turned down: Moratorium Plus, aimed at forbidding the building of new nuclear power plants (41.6% supported and 58.4% opposed),[174] and Electricity Without Nuclear (33.7% supported and 66.3% opposed) after a previous moratorium expired in 2000.[175] However, as a reaction to the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the Swiss government announced in 2011 that it plans to end its use of nuclear energy in the next 2 or 3 decades.[176] In November 2016, Swiss voters rejected a proposal by the Green Party to accelerate the phaseout of nuclear power (45.8% supported and 54.2% opposed).[177] The Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) is the office responsible for all questions relating to energy supply and energy use within the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC). The agency is supporting the 2000-watt society initiative to cut the nation's energy use by more than half by the year 2050.[178] Entrance of the new Lötschberg Base Tunnel, the third-longest railway tunnel in the world, under the old Lötschberg railway line. It was the first completed tunnel of the greater project NRLA. The most dense rail network in Europe[55] of 5,250 kilometres (3,260 mi) carries over 596 million passengers annually (as of 2015).[179] In 2015, each Swiss resident travelled on average 2,550 kilometres (1,580 mi) by rail, which makes them the keenest rail users.[179] Virtually 100% of the network is electrified. The vast majority (60%) of the network is operated by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS). Besides the second largest standard gauge railway company BLS AG two railways companies operating on narrow gauge networks are the Rhaetian Railway (RhB) in the southeastern canton of Graubünden, which includes some World Heritage lines,[180] and the Matterhorn Gotthard Bahn (MGB), which co-operates together with RhB the Glacier Express between Zermatt and St. Moritz/Davos. On 31 May 2016 the world's longest and deepest railway tunnel and the first flat, low-level route through the Alps, the 57.1-kilometre long (35.5 mi) Gotthard Base Tunnel, opened as the largest part of the New Railway Link through the Alps (NRLA) project after 17 years of realization. It started its daily business for passenger transport on 11 December 2016 replacing the old, mountainous, scenic route over and through the St Gotthard Massif. Switzerland has a publicly managed road network without road tolls that is financed by highway permits as well as vehicle and gasoline taxes. The Swiss autobahn/autoroute system requires the purchase of a vignette (toll sticker)—which costs 40 Swiss francs—for one calendar year in order to use its roadways, for both passenger cars and trucks. The Swiss autobahn/autoroute network has a total length of 1,638 km (1,018 mi) (as of 2000) and has, by an area of 41,290 km2 (15,940 sq mi), also one of the highest motorway densities in the world.[181] Zurich Airport is Switzerland's largest international flight gateway, which handled 22.8 million passengers in 2012.[182] The other international airports are Geneva Airport (13.9 million passengers in 2012),[183] EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg which is located in France, Bern Airport, Lugano Airport, St. Gallen-Altenrhein Airport and Sion Airport. Swiss International Air Lines is the flag carrier of Switzerland. Its main hub is Zürich, but it is legally domiciled in Basel. Switzerland has one of the best environmental records among nations in the developed world;[184] it was one of the countries to sign the Kyoto Protocol in 1998 and ratified it in 2003. With Mexico and the Republic of Korea it forms the Environmental Integrity Group (EIG).[185] The country is heavily active in recycling and anti-littering regulations and is one of the top recyclers in the world, with 66% to 96% of recyclable materials being recycled, depending on the area of the country.[186] The 2014 Global Green Economy Index ranked Switzerland among the top 10 green economies in the world.[187] Switzerland developed an efficient system to recycle most recyclable materials.[188] Publicly organised collection by volunteers and economical railway transport logistics started as early as 1865 under the leadership of the notable industrialist Hans Caspar Escher (Escher Wyss AG) when the first modern Swiss paper manufacturing plant was built in Biberist.[189] Switzerland also has an economic system for garbage disposal, which is based mostly on recycling and energy-producing incinerators due to a strong political will to protect the environment.[190] As in other European countries, the illegal disposal of garbage is not tolerated at all and heavily fined. In almost all Swiss municipalities, stickers or dedicated garbage bags need to be purchased that allow for the identification of disposable garbage.[191] Demographics Main articles: Demographics of Switzerland and Swiss people Further information: List of Swiss people Population density in Switzerland (2019) Percentage of foreigners in Switzerland (2019) In 2018, Switzerland's population slightly exceeded 8.5 million. In common with other developed countries, the Swiss population increased rapidly during the industrial era, quadrupling between 1800 and 1990 and has continued to grow. Like most of Europe, Switzerland faces an ageing population, albeit with consistent annual growth projected into 2035, due mostly to immigration and a fertility rate close to replacement level.[192] Switzerland subsequently has one of the oldest populations in the world, with the average age of 42.5 years.[193] As of 2019[update], resident foreigners make up 25.2% of the population, one of the largest proportions in the developed world.[9] Most of these (64%) were from European Union or EFTA countries.[194] Italians were the largest single group of foreigners, with 15.6% of total foreign population, followed closely by Germans (15.2%), immigrants from Portugal (12.7%), France (5.6%), Serbia (5.3%), Turkey (3.8%), Spain (3.7%), and Austria (2%). Immigrants from Sri Lanka, most of them former Tamil refugees, were the largest group among people of Asian origin (6.3%).[194] Additionally, the figures from 2012 show that 34.7% of the permanent resident population aged 15 or over in Switzerland (around 2.33 million), had an immigrant background. A third of this population (853,000) held Swiss citizenship. Four fifths of persons with an immigration background were themselves immigrants (first generation foreigners and native-born and naturalised Swiss citizens), whereas one fifth were born in Switzerland (second generation foreigners and native-born and naturalised Swiss citizens).[195] In the 2000s, domestic and international institutions expressed concern about what was perceived as an increase in xenophobia, particularly in some political campaigns. In reply to one critical report, the Federal Council noted that ""racism unfortunately is present in Switzerland"", but stated that the high proportion of foreign citizens in the country, as well as the generally unproblematic integration of foreigners, underlined Switzerland's openness.[196] Follow-up study conducted in 2018 found that 59% considered racism a serious problem in Switzerland.[197] The proportion of the population that has reported being targeted by racial discrimination has increased in recent years, from 10% in 2014 to almost 17% in 2018, according to the Federal Statistical Office.[198] Drug use is comparable to other developed countries[citation needed][dubious – discuss] with 14% of men and 6.5% of women between 20 and 24 saying they had consumed cannabis in the past 30 days,[199] and 5 Swiss cities were listed among the top 10 European cities for cocaine use as measured in wastewater.[200][201] Languages Main article: Languages of Switzerland National languages in Switzerland (2016):   German (62.8%)   French (22.9%)   Italian (8.2%)   Romansh (0.5%)[202] Switzerland has four national languages: mainly German (spoken by 62.8% of the population in 2016); French (22.9%) in the west; and Italian (8.2%) in the south.[203][202] The fourth national language, Romansh (0.5%), is a Romance language spoken locally in the southeastern trilingual canton of Grisons, and is designated by Article 4 of the Federal Constitution as a national language along with German, French, and Italian, and in Article 70 as an official language if the authorities communicate with persons who speak Romansh. However, federal laws and other official acts do not need to be decreed in Romansh. In 2016, the languages most spoken at home among permanent residents aged 15 and older were Swiss German (59.4%), French (23.5%), Standard German (10.6%), and Italian (8.5%). Other languages spoken at home included English (5.0%), Portuguese (3.8%), Albanian (3.0%), Spanish (2.6%) and Serbian and Croatian (2.5%). 6.9% reported speaking another language at home.[204] In 2014 almost two-thirds (64.4%) of the permanent resident population indicated speaking more than one language regularly.[205] The federal government is obliged to communicate in the official languages, and in the federal parliament simultaneous translation is provided from and into German, French and Italian.[206] Aside from the official forms of their respective languages, the four linguistic regions of Switzerland also have their local dialectal forms. The role played by dialects in each linguistic region varies dramatically: in the German-speaking regions, Swiss German dialects have become ever more prevalent since the second half of the 20th century, especially in the media, such as radio and television, and are used as an everyday language for many, while the Swiss variety of Standard German is almost always used instead of dialect for written communication (c.f. diglossic usage of a language).[207] Conversely, in the French-speaking regions the local dialects have almost disappeared (only 6.3% of the population of Valais, 3.9% of Fribourg, and 3.1% of Jura still spoke dialects at the end of the 20th century), while in the Italian-speaking regions dialects are mostly limited to family settings and casual conversation.[207] The principal official languages (German, French, and Italian) have terms, not used outside of Switzerland, known as Helvetisms. German Helvetisms are, roughly speaking, a large group of words typical of Swiss Standard German, which do not appear either in Standard German, nor in other German dialects. These include terms from Switzerland's surrounding language cultures (German Billett[208] from French), from similar terms in another language (Italian azione used not only as act but also as discount from German Aktion).[209] The French spoken in Switzerland has similar terms, which are equally known as Helvetisms. The most frequent characteristics of Helvetisms are in vocabulary, phrases, and pronunciation, but certain Helvetisms denote themselves as special in syntax and orthography likewise. Duden, the comprehensive German dictionary, contains about 3000 Helvetisms.[209] Current French dictionaries, such as the Petit Larousse, include several hundred Helvetisms.[210] Learning one of the other national languages at school is compulsory for all Swiss pupils, so many Swiss are supposed to be at least bilingual, especially those belonging to linguistic minority groups.[211] Health Main articles: Health in Switzerland and Healthcare in Switzerland Swiss residents are universally required to buy health insurance from private insurance companies, which in turn are required to accept every applicant. While the cost of the system is among the highest, it compares well with other European countries in terms of health outcomes; patients have been reported as being, in general, highly satisfied with it.[212][213][214] In 2012, life expectancy at birth was 80.4 years for men and 84.7 years for women[215] — the highest in the world.[216][217] However, spending on health is particularly high at 11.4% of GDP (2010), on par with Germany and France (11.6%) and other European countries, but notably less than spending in the USA (17.6%).[218] From 1990, a steady increase can be observed, reflecting the high costs of the services provided.[219] With an ageing population and new healthcare technologies, health spending will likely continue to rise.[219] It is estimated that one out of six persons in Switzerland suffers from mental illness.[220] Urbanisation Main article: Towns of Switzerland Urbanisation in the Rhone Valley (outskirts of Sion) Between two thirds and three quarters of the population live in urban areas.[221][222] Switzerland has gone from a largely rural country to an urban one in just 70 years. Since 1935 urban development has claimed as much of the Swiss landscape as it did during the previous 2,000 years. This urban sprawl does not only affect the plateau but also the Jura and the Alpine foothills[223] and there are growing concerns about land use.[224] However, from the beginning of the 21st century, the population growth in urban areas is higher than in the countryside.[222] Switzerland has a dense network of towns, where large, medium and small towns are complementary.[222] The plateau is very densely populated with about 450 people per km2 and the landscape continually shows signs of human presence.[225] The weight of the largest metropolitan areas, which are Zürich, Geneva–Lausanne, Basel and Bern tend to increase.[222] In international comparison the importance of these urban areas is stronger than their number of inhabitants suggests.[222] In addition the three main centres of Zürich, Geneva and Basel are recognised for their particularly great quality of life.[226] Largest cities vte Largest towns in SwitzerlandSwiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO), Neuchâtel, 2019[227] Rank Name Canton Pop.

These churches, and in some cantons also the Old Catholic Church and Jewish congregations, are financed by official taxation of adherents.[228] Christianity is the predominant religion of Switzerland (about 67% of resident population in 2016-2018[4] and 75% of Swiss citizens[229]), divided between the Catholic Church (35.8% of the population), the Swiss Reformed Church (23.8%), further Protestant churches (2.2%), Eastern Orthodoxy (2.5%), and other Christian denominations (2.2%).[4] Immigration has established Islam (5.3%) as a sizeable minority religion.[4] 26.3% of Swiss permanent residents are not affiliated with any religious community (Atheism, Agnosticism, and others).[4] As of the 2000 census other Christian minority communities included Neo-Pietism (0.44%), Pentecostalism (0.28%, mostly incorporated in the Schweizer Pfingstmission), Methodism (0.13%), the New Apostolic Church (0.45%), Jehovah's Witnesses (0.28%), other Protestant denominations (0.20%), the Old Catholic Church (0.18%), other Christian denominations (0.20%). Non-Christian religions are Hinduism (0.38%), Buddhism (0.29%), Judaism (0.25%) and others (0.11%); 4.3% did not make a statement.[230] The country was historically about evenly balanced between Catholic and Protestant, with a complex patchwork of majorities over most of the country. Switzerland played an exceptional role during the Reformation as it became home to many reformers. Geneva converted to Protestantism in 1536, just before John Calvin arrived there. In 1541, he founded the Republic of Geneva on his own ideals. It became known internationally as the Protestant Rome, and housed such reformers as Theodore Beza, William Farel or Pierre Viret. Zürich became another stronghold around the same time, with Huldrych Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger taking the lead there. Anabaptists Felix Manz and Conrad Grebel also operated there. They were later joined by the fleeing Peter Martyr Vermigli and Hans Denck. Other centres included Basel (Andreas Karlstadt and Johannes Oecolampadius), Berne (Berchtold Haller and Niklaus Manuel), and St. Gallen (Joachim Vadian). One canton, Appenzell, was officially divided into Catholic and Protestant sections in 1597. The larger cities and their cantons (Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Zürich and Basel) used to be predominantly Protestant. Central Switzerland, the Valais, the Ticino, Appenzell Innerrhodes, the Jura, and Fribourg are traditionally Catholic. The Swiss Constitution of 1848, under the recent impression of the clashes of Catholic vs. Protestant cantons that culminated in the Sonderbundskrieg, consciously defines a consociational state, allowing the peaceful co-existence of Catholics and Protestants. A 1980 initiative calling for the complete separation of church and state was rejected by 78.9% of the voters.[231] Some traditionally Protestant cantons and cities nowadays have a slight Catholic majority, not because they were growing in members, quite the contrary, but only because since about 1970 a steadily growing minority became not affiliated with any church or other religious body (21.4% in Switzerland, 2012) especially in traditionally Protestant regions, such as Basel-City (42%), canton of Neuchâtel (38%), canton of Geneva (35%), canton of Vaud (26%), or Zürich city (city: >25%; canton: 23%).[232] Culture Main article: Culture of Switzerland See also: Music of Switzerland, Swiss folklore, and Alpine culture Alphorn concert in Vals Three of Europe's major languages are official in Switzerland. Swiss culture is characterised by diversity, which is reflected in a wide range of traditional customs.[233] A region may be in some ways strongly culturally connected to the neighbouring country that shares its language, the country itself being rooted in western European culture.[234] The linguistically isolated Romansh culture in Graubünden in eastern Switzerland constitutes an exception, it survives only in the upper valleys of the Rhine and the Inn and strives to maintain its rare linguistic tradition. Switzerland is home to many notable contributors to literature, art, architecture, music and sciences. In addition the country attracted a number of creative persons during time of unrest or war in Europe.[235] Some 1000 museums are distributed through the country; the number has more than tripled since 1950.[236] Among the most important cultural performances held annually are the Paléo Festival, Lucerne Festival,[237] the Montreux Jazz Festival,[238] the Locarno International Film Festival and the Art Basel.[239] Alpine symbolism has played an essential role in shaping the history of the country and the Swiss national identity.[17][240] Many alpine areas and ski resorts offer winter sports during the colder months as well as hiking (German: das Wandern) or Mountain biking in summer. Other areas throughout the year have a recreational culture that caters to tourism such as sightseeing, yet the quieter seasons are spring and autumn when there are fewer visitors. A traditional farmer and herder culture also predominates in many areas and small farms are omnipresent outside the towns. Folk art is kept alive in organisations all over the country. In Switzerland, it is mostly expressed in music, dance, poetry, wood carving and embroidery. The alphorn, a trumpet-like musical instrument made of wood, has become alongside yodeling and the accordion an epitome of traditional Swiss music.[241][242] Literature Main article: Literature of Switzerland Jean-Jacques Rousseau was not only a writer but also an influential philosopher of the eighteenth century.[243] As the Confederation, from its foundation in 1291, was almost exclusively composed of German-speaking regions, the earliest forms of literature are in German. In the 18th century, French became the fashionable language in Bern and elsewhere, while the influence of the French-speaking allies and subject lands was more marked than before.[244] Among the classic authors of Swiss German literature are Jeremias Gotthelf (1797–1854) and Gottfried Keller (1819–1890). The undisputed giants of 20th-century Swiss literature are Max Frisch (1911–91) and Friedrich Dürrenmatt (1921–90), whose repertoire includes Die Physiker (The Physicists) and Das Versprechen (The Pledge), released in 2001 as a Hollywood film.[245] Famous French-speaking writers were Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) and Germaine de Staël (1766–1817). More recent authors include Charles Ferdinand Ramuz (1878–1947), whose novels describe the lives of peasants and mountain dwellers, set in a harsh environment and Blaise Cendrars (born Frédéric Sauser, 1887–1961).[245] Italian and Romansh-speaking authors also contributed to the Swiss literary landscape, but generally in more modest ways given their small number. Probably the most famous Swiss literary creation, Heidi, the story of an orphan girl who lives with her grandfather in the Alps, is one of the most popular children's books ever and has come to be a symbol of Switzerland. Her creator, Johanna Spyri (1827–1901), wrote a number of other books on similar themes.[245] Media Main article: Media of Switzerland The freedom of the press and the right to free expression is guaranteed in the federal constitution of Switzerland.[246] The Swiss News Agency (SNA) broadcasts information around-the-clock in three of the four national languages—on politics, economics, society and culture. The SNA supplies almost all Swiss media and a couple of dozen foreign media services with its news.[246] Switzerland has historically boasted the greatest number of newspaper titles published in proportion to its population and size.[247] The most influential newspapers are the German-language Tages-Anzeiger and Neue Zürcher Zeitung NZZ, and the French-language Le Temps, but almost every city has at least one local newspaper. The cultural diversity accounts for a variety of newspapers.[247] The government exerts greater control over broadcast media than print media, especially due to finance and licensing.[247] The Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, whose name was recently changed to SRG SSR, is charged with the production and broadcast of radio and television programmes. SRG SSR studios are distributed throughout the various language regions. Radio content is produced in six central and four regional studios while the television programmes are produced in Geneva, Zürich, Basel, and Lugano. An extensive cable network also allows most Swiss to access the programmes from neighbouring countries.[247] Sports Main article: Sport in Switzerland Ski area over the glaciers of Saas-Fee Skiing, snowboarding and mountaineering are among the most popular sports in Switzerland, the nature of the country being particularly suited for such activities.[248] Winter sports are practised by the natives and tourists since the second half of the 19th century with the invention of bobsleigh in St. Moritz.[249] The first world ski championships were held in Mürren (1931) and St. Moritz (1934). The latter town hosted the second Winter Olympic Games in 1928 and the fifth edition in 1948. Among the most successful skiers and world champions are Pirmin Zurbriggen and Didier Cuche. The most prominently watched sports in Switzerland are football, ice hockey, Alpine skiing, ""Schwingen"", and tennis.[250] The headquarters of the international football's and ice hockey's governing bodies, the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) and International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), are located in Zürich. Many other headquarters of international sports federations are located in Switzerland. For example, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), IOC's Olympic Museum and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) are located in Lausanne. Switzerland hosted the 1954 FIFA World Cup, and was the joint host, with Austria, of the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament. The Swiss Super League is the nation's professional football club league. Europe's highest football pitch, at 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) above sea level, is located in Switzerland and is named the Ottmar Hitzfeld Stadium.[251] Roger Federer has won a record 20 Grand Slam singles titles, making him the most successful men's tennis player ever.[252] Many Swiss also follow ice hockey and support one of the 12 teams of the National League, which is the most attended league in Europe.[253] In 2009, Switzerland hosted the IIHF World Championship for the 10th time.[254] It also became World Vice-Champion in 2013 and 2018. The numerous lakes make Switzerland an attractive place for sailing. The largest, Lake Geneva, is the home of the sailing team Alinghi which was the first European team to win the America's Cup in 2003 and which successfully defended the title in 2007. Swiss tennis player Roger Federer is widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. He has won 20 Grand Slam tournaments overall including a record 8 Wimbledon titles. He has also won a record 6 ATP Finals.[255] He was ranked no. 1 in the ATP Rankings for a record 237 consecutive weeks. He ended 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009 ranked no. 1. Fellow swiss tennis stars Martina Hingis and Stan Wawrinka also hold multiple Grand Slam titles. Switzerland won the Davis Cup title in 2014. Motorsport racecourses and events were banned in Switzerland following the 1955 Le Mans disaster with exception to events such as Hillclimbing. During this period, the country still produced successful racing drivers such as Clay Regazzoni, Sébastien Buemi, Jo Siffert, Dominique Aegerter, successful World Touring Car Championship driver Alain Menu, 2014 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Marcel Fässler and 2015 24 Hours Nürburgring winner Nico Müller. Switzerland also won the A1GP World Cup of Motorsport in 2007–08 with driver Neel Jani. Swiss motorcycle racer Thomas Lüthi won the 2005 MotoGP World Championship in the 125cc category. In June 2007 the Swiss National Council, one house of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland, voted to overturn the ban, however the other house, the Swiss Council of States rejected the change and the ban remains in place.[256][257] Traditional sports include Swiss wrestling or ""Schwingen"". It is an old tradition from the rural central cantons and considered the national sport by some. Hornussen is another indigenous Swiss sport, which is like a cross between baseball and golf.[258] Steinstossen is the Swiss variant of stone put, a competition in throwing a heavy stone. Practised only among the alpine population since prehistoric times, it is recorded to have taken place in Basel in the 13th century. It is also central to the Unspunnenfest, first held in 1805, with its symbol the 83.5 stone named Unspunnenstein.[259] Cuisine Main article: Swiss cuisine See also: Culinary Heritage of Switzerland Fondue is melted cheese, into which bread is dipped. The cuisine of Switzerland is multifaceted. While some dishes such as fondue, raclette or rösti are omnipresent through the country, each region developed its own gastronomy according to the differences of climate and languages.[260][261] Traditional Swiss cuisine uses ingredients similar to those in other European countries, as well as unique dairy products and cheeses such as Gruyère or Emmental, produced in the valleys of Gruyères and Emmental. The number of fine-dining establishments is high, particularly in western Switzerland.[262][263] Chocolate has been made in Switzerland since the 18th century but it gained its reputation at the end of the 19th century with the invention of modern techniques such as conching and tempering which enabled its production on a high-quality level. Also a breakthrough was the invention of solid milk chocolate in 1875 by Daniel Peter. The Swiss are the world's largest consumers of chocolate.[264][265] Due to the popularisation of processed foods at the end of the 19th century, Swiss health food pioneer Maximilian Bircher-Benner created the first nutrition-based therapy in form of the well-known rolled oats cereal dish, called Birchermüesli. The most popular alcoholic drink in Switzerland is wine. Switzerland is notable for the variety of grapes grown because of the large variations in terroirs, with their specific mixes of soil, air, altitude and light. Swiss wine is produced mainly in Valais, Vaud (Lavaux), Geneva and Ticino, with a small majority of white wines. Vineyards have been cultivated in Switzerland since the Roman era, even though certain traces can be found of a more ancient origin. The most widespread varieties are the Chasselas (called Fendant in Valais) and Pinot noir. The Merlot is the main variety produced in Ticino.[266][267] See also Switzerland portal Europe portal Index of Switzerland-related articles Outline of Switzerland List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe Notes and references Notes ^ a b Bern is referred to as ""federal city"" (German: Bundesstadt, French: ville fédérale, Italian: città federale). Swiss law does not designate a capital as such, but the federal parliament and government are located in Bern, while the federal courts are located in other cities. ^ The original date of the Rütlischwur was 1307 (reported by Aegidius Tschudi in the 16th century) and is just one among several comparable treaties between more or less the same parties during that period. The date of the Federal Charter of 1291 was selected in 1891 for the official celebration of the ""Confederacy's 600th anniversary"". ^ A solemn declaration of the Tagsatzung declared the Federal Constitution adopted on 12 September 1848. A resolution of the Tagsatzung of 14 September 1848 specified that the powers of the institutions provided for by the 1815 Federal Treaty would expire at the time of the constitution of the Federal Council, which took place on 16 November 1848. ^ There are several definitions. See Geography of Switzerland#Western or Central Europe?. ^ Swiss Standard German spelling and pronunciation. The Swiss German name is sometimes spelled as Schwyz or Schwiiz [ˈʃʋiːt͡s]. Schwyz is also the standard German (and international) name of one of the Swiss cantons. ^ The latter is the common Sursilvan pronunciation. ^ As shown in this image, the current members of the council are (as of January 2016, from left to right): Federal Councillor Alain Berset, Federal Councillor Didier Burkhalter, Vice-President Doris Leuthard, President Johann Schneider-Ammann, Federal Councillor Ueli Maurer, Federal Councillor Simonetta Sommaruga, Federal Councillor Guy Parmelin and Federal Chancellor Corina Casanova ^ Since 1999, an initiative can also be in the form of a general proposal to be elaborated by Parliament, but because it is considered less attractive for various reasons, this form of initiative has yet to find any use. ^ That is a majority of 23 cantonal votes because the result of the popular vote in the six traditional half-cantons each counts as half the vote of one of the other cantons. ^ In 2008, the ETH Zürich was ranked 15th in the field Natural Sciences and Mathematics by the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities and the EPFL in Lausanne was ranked 18th in the field Engineering/Technology and Computer Sciences by the same ranking. ^ Nobel prizes in non-science categories included.

Als 1848 ein politisch-administratives Zentrum für den neuen Bundesstaat zu bestimmen war, verzichteten die Verfassungsväter darauf, eine Hauptstadt der Schweiz zu bezeichnen und formulierten stattdessen in Artikel 108: «Alles, was sich auf den Sitz der Bundesbehörden bezieht, ist Gegenstand der Bundesgesetzgebung.» Die Bundesstadt ist also nicht mehr und nicht weniger als der Sitz der Bundesbehörden. ^ ""DSTAT-TAB - interactive tables (FSO): Demographic balance by citizenship"" (official statistics) (in English, German, French, and Italian).

Wie es um die Kundenzufriedenheit in der Branche generell steht, zeigt eine 2013 im Auftrag von «K-Tipp» durchgeführte repräsentative Umfrage unter Versicherten, die in den vergangenen zwei Jahren Leistungen von ihrer Krankenkasse in Anspruch genommen haben. Beim Testsieger Concordia waren rund 73% der Versicherten «sehr zufrieden». Bei grossen Krankenkassen wie der CSS und Helsana betrug dieser Anteil 70% beziehungsweise 63%. Groupe Mutuel erreichte rund 50%, und die Billigkasse Assura kam auf 44%. Dies illustriert, dass die Zufriedenheit durchaus hoch ist – dass es aber auch Potenzial für Effizienzsteigerungen bei Krankenkassen gibt. ^ ""Components of population change – Data, indicators: Deaths, mortality and life expectancy"".

You are hereHome / National Scout Organizations National Scout Organizations Scouting is a global movement with over 54 million Scouts worldwide, all part of recognised National Scout Organizations (NSOs) of WOSM (also known as Member Organizations). The role of the NSO is to support and develop Scouting in that country, and facilitate contacts with other NSOs and the World Organization. To become a member of WOSM, NSOs must gain recognition from the World Scout Conference. There can only be one NSO per country. In the case of a country having more than one National Scout Association (NSA), a federation is formed for the purpose of national coordination and world membership. There are currently 172 Member Organizations in the world. In addition to the 172 Member Organizations, local Scouting activities exist in at least another 52 countries and territories worldwide. List of National Scout Organizations Membership figures Below you can find the membership census as of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. In some countries, the National Scout Organization may be larger than indicated, where girls and women are registered only as members of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS). WOSM Membership Census Scouting Elsewhere Main Territories There are 38 main territories where Scouting exists, often as overseas branches of member NSOs: Aland Islands, Anguilla, Antarctica, Bermuda, Bonaire-Saint Eustatius and Saba, Bouvet Island, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin Island, Cayman Islands, Christmas Islands, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Falkland Islands (Malvinas), Faroe Islands, French Guiana, Gibraltar, Greenland, Guadeloupe, Guam, Head Island and McDonald Islands, Martinique, Mayotte, Montserrat, New Caledonia, Norfolk Island, Pitcairn, Réunion, Saint Barthelemy, Saint Helena, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre & Miquelon, Sint Maarten, South Georgia and the South Sandwich, Svalbard and Jan Mayen, Turks and Caicos Islands, US Minor Outlying Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands, Wallis and Futuna Potential Member Countries There are 14 countries where Scouting exists (be it embryonic or widespread) but where there is no National Scout Organization which is yet a member of WOSM. Albania, Central African Republic, Congo, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Mali, Nauru, Samoa, Somalia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan WOSM maintains official contacts with French Polynesia, which is an associate member of the Asia-Pacific Scout Region. Countries with no Scouting There are five countries where Scouting, to WOSM's knowledge, does not exist; in some it would not be allowed. These are: Andorra, People's Republic of China, Cuba, Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Lao People's Democratic Republic. Share Are you sure you want to delete this?

WOSM has 172 members.[3] These members are recognized national Scout organizations, which collectively have over 50 million participants.[6] WOSM was established in 1922,[1][2] and has its operational headquarters at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and its legal seat in Geneva, Switzerland. It is the counterpart of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS). The WOSM's current stated mission is ""to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Scout Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society"".[7][8] WOSM is organized into regions and operates with a conference, committee and bureau. The WOSM is associated with three World Scout Centres. The World Scout Jamboree is held roughly every four years under the auspices of the WOSM, with members of WAGGGS also invited. WOSM also organises the World Scout Moot, a Jamboree for 17- to 26-year-olds, and has organised the World Scout Indaba, a gathering for Scout leaders. The World Scout Foundation is a perpetual fund governed by a separate Board of Governors and supported by donations for the development of WOSM associated Scouting programs throughout the world. WOSM is a non-governmental organization with General Consultative Status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).[9] Contents 1 History 2 World Scout Conference 3 World Scout Committee 3.1 Current members 2017-2020 (2021)* 3.2 Bronze Wolf Award 4 World Scout Bureau 4.1 Location 4.2 Leadership 5 World Scout Centres 6 World Scout programmes 7 World Scout emblem 8 Recognition of non-national Scouting organizations 9 Publications 10 See also 11 References 12 Further reading 13 External links History[edit] As a result of an international conference held during the first World Scout Jamboree at Olympia, London in 1920, leaders there agreed to create a Boy Scouts International Bureau (BSIB). An office was established at 25, Buckingham Palace Road, London, and the then International Commissioner of The Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom, Hubert S. Martin, was appointed as Honorary Director. The first task of the bureau was to co-ordinate the discussions and to prepare a second international conference in Paris in 1922.[1][2] At the 1922 Paris conference The International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement, its committee and BSIB were constituted by the founding member organizations.[2] In 1961 The International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement reconstituted the organization introducing the name World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). The International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement became the WOSM's World Scout Conference, its International Committee became the World Scout Committee and the Boy Scouts International Bureau became the WOSM's World Scout Bureau.[10] World Scout Conference[edit] The World Scout Conference (WSC) is the governing body and meets every three years, preceded by the World Scout Youth Forum. The World Scout Conference is the general assembly of Scouting and is composed of six delegates from each of the member Scout associations. If a country has more than one association, the associations form a federation for coordination and world representation. The basis for recognition and membership in the World Scout Conference includes adherence to the aims and principles of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, and independence from political involvement on the part of each member association.[11] The Conference meets every three years and is hosted by a member association. At the World Scout Conference basic cooperative efforts are agreed upon and a plan of mutual coordination is adopted.[12] Date Number Location Country Member Countries Host Candidate Countries 1920 Retrospectively referred to as the ""First International Conference"" London United Kingdom 33 1922 First International Conference (retrospectively referred to as the ""Second"")[2] Paris France 30 1924 Third International Conference Copenhagen Denmark 34 1926 Fourth International Conference Kandersteg Switzerland 29 1929 Fifth International Conference Birkenhead United Kingdom 33 1931 Sixth International Conference Baden bei Wien Austria 44 1933 Seventh International Conference Gödöllő Hungary 31 1935 Eighth International Conference Stockholm Sweden 28 1937 Ninth International Conference The Hague Netherlands 34 1939 10th International Conference Edinburgh United Kingdom 27 1947 11th International Conference Château de Rosny-sur-Seine France 32 1949 12th International Conference Elvesaeter Norway 25 1951 13th International Conference Salzburg Austria 34 1953 14th International Conference Vaduz Liechtenstein 35 1955 15th International Conference Niagara Falls, Ontario Canada 44 1957 16th International Conference Cambridge United Kingdom 52 1959 17th International Conference New Delhi India 35 1961 18th International Conference Lisbon Portugal[13] 50 1963 19th World Scout Conference Rhodes Greece 52 1965 20th World Scout Conference Mexico City Mexico 59 1967 21st World Scout Conference Seattle United States 70 1969 22nd World Scout Conference Espoo Finland 64 1971 23rd World Scout Conference Tokyo Japan 71 1973 24th World Scout Conference Nairobi Kenya 77 1975 25th World Scout Conference Lundtoft Denmark 87 1977 26th World Scout Conference Montreal Canada 81 1979 27th World Scout Conference Birmingham United Kingdom 81 1981 28th World Scout Conference Dakar Senegal 74 1983 29th World Scout Conference Dearborn United States 90 1985 30th World Scout Conference Munich West Germany 93 1988 31st World Scout Conference Melbourne Australia 77 1990 32nd World Scout Conference Paris France 100 1993 33rd World Scout Conference Sattahip Thailand 99 1996 34th World Scout Conference Oslo Norway 108 1999 35th World Scout Conference Durban South Africa 116 2002 36th World Scout Conference Thessaloniki Greece 125 2005 37th World Scout Conference Hammamet Tunisia 122 Hong Kong 2008 38th World Scout Conference Jeju-do South Korea 150 2011 39th World Scout Conference Curitiba Brazil 138 Australia,  Hong Kong,  Switzerland 2014 40th World Scout Conference Ljubljana Slovenia 143 Italy 2017 41st World Scout Conference Baku Azerbaijan 169[14] Malaysia 2020 42nd World Scout Conference Sharm El Sheikh Egypt Postponed Malaysia 2021 42nd World Scout Conference Digital 2025 43rd World Scout Conference Sharm El Sheikh Egypt France, Mexico World Scout Committee[edit] The World Scout Committee is the executive body of the World Scout Conference and is composed of elected volunteers and one appointed Secretary General. The World Scout Committee represents World Scout Conference between the meetings of the full conference. The World Scout Committee is responsible for the implementation of the resolutions of the World Scout Conference and for acting on its behalf between its meetings. The Committee meets twice a year, usually in Geneva. Its Steering Committee, consisting of the Chairman, two Vice-Chairmen, a Youth Advisor and the Secretary General, meet as needed.[15] The committee has 21 members. Twelve, each from a different country, are elected for three-year terms by the World Scout Conference. The members, elected without regard to their nationality, represent the interests of the movement as a whole, not those of their country. The Secretary General, the Treasurer of WOSM and a representative member of the board of the World Scout Foundation and the chairmen of the regional Scout committees are ex-officio members of the committee. The six Youth Advisors to the WSC are elected by the World Scout Youth Forum are participating in all of the WSC meetings and are also part of the governing structure between the meetings. The World Scout Committee has set up work streams to address the top strategic priorities, as defined by the World Scout Conference, which at present include: Youth involvement Volunteers in Scouting Scouting's profile (communications, partnerships, resources) Standing committees include: Audit Budget Constitutions Ethics Honours and Awards Working With Others- a consultative committee of the WOSM and the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), composed of members of the World Committee/World Board of both organizations 2007 Task Force for the 100th Anniversary of Scouting, composed of members of the World Scout Committee, World Scout Bureau, World Scout Foundation, and The Scout Association of the United Kingdom Current members 2017-2020 (2021)*[edit] Name[16][17] Country Term to* Craig Turpie, Chairperson United Kingdom 2021 Jemima Nartey, Vice-Chair Ghana 2021 Andy Chapman, Vice-Chair United States 2021 Mehdi Ben Khelil Tunisia 2021 Peter Blatch Australia 2021 Jo Deman Belgium 2021 Janaprith Fernando Sri Lanka 2021 Ilyas Ismayilli Azerbaijan 2021 Sarah Rita Kattan Lebanon 2021 Leonardo Morales Morales Costa Rica 2021 Pia Melin Mortensen Denmark 2021 Juan Reig Spain 2021 Ahmad Alhendawi, Secretary General Jordan[18] Joseph Lau, Treasurer Hong Kong Héctor Robledo Cervantes, Chairperson WSF Mexico 2021** Kent Clayburn, Chairperson Elect, WSF USA TBA Note: The World Scout Conference in 2008 decided that, starting at the World Conference in 2011, elected members will serve for only three years, but be eligible for re-election for one additional term. Due SARS-COV2 (COVID-19) pandemic, the World Scout Conference was rescheduled from Aug 2020 to Aug 2021. Bronze Wolf Award[edit] The Bronze Wolf Award is the only distinction awarded by WOSM, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting. It was first awarded to Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell by a unanimous decision of the then-International Committee on the day of the institution of the Bronze Wolf in Stockholm in 1935. World Scout Bureau[edit] The World Scout Bureau is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and has offices in six regional divisions:   European Region: Geneva, Switzerland; Brussels, Belgium and Belgrade, Serbia   Arab Region: Cairo, Egypt   Africa Region: Nairobi, Kenya; Cape Town, South Africa; and Dakar, Senegal   Asia-Pacific Region: Makati, Philippines; Australia; Nepal[citation needed]; and Tokyo, Japan   Interamerican Region: Ciudad del Saber, Panama   Eurasian Region: Kyiv, Ukraine   grey areas such as North Korea, Laos and Cuba have no Scouting The World Scout Bureau (WSB, formerly the International Bureau) is the secretariat that carries out the instructions of the World Scout Conference and the World Scout Committee. The WSB is administered by the secretary general, who is supported by a small staff of technical resource personnel. The bureau staff helps associations improve and broaden their Scouting by training professionals and volunteers, establishing finance policies and money-raising techniques, improving community facilities and procedures, and assisting in marshaling the national resources of each country behind Scouting.[11] The staff also helps arrange global events such as the World Scout Jamborees, encourages regional events, and acts as a liaison between the Scouting Movement and other international organizations. A major effort in the emerging nations is the extension of the universal Good Turn into an organization-wide effort for community development.[19] Location[edit] The Bureau was first established in London, England in 1920 and moved to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada in 1959. The International Conference directed the move of the Bureau from Ottawa to Geneva on 1 May 1968.[20] In August 2013, WOSM announced the relocation of the World Scout Bureau Central Office (WSB-CO) to Kuala Lumpur where it is now located.[21] Leadership[edit] This list includes Secretaries General ||and their deputies from the World Organization of the Scout Movement and members of the World Scout Bureau.

World Scout programmes[edit] The Better World Framework combines the Scouts of the World Award, Messengers of Peace and World Scout Environment Programmes as programme initiatives administered by the World Scout Bureau. [23] World Scout emblem[edit] 1939-1955 version of the World Scout Emblem, used by the Boy Scouts International Bureau and International Committee members The WOSM emblem and membership badge is the World Scout Emblem, a purple, circular logo with a fleur-de-lis in the center, surrounded by a length of rope tied with a reef knot (also called a square knot). Baden-Powell used a fleur-de-lis badge awarded to British Army scouts and subsequently adopted and modified the badge for Scouting. The arrowhead represents the North point on a compass, and is intended to point Scouts on the path to service and unity. The three points on the fleur-de-lis represent the three parts of the Scout Promise: - service to others, duty to God and obedience to the Scout Law.[24] The two five-point stars stand for truth and knowledge, with the ten points representing the ten points of the Scout Law. The bond at the base of the fleur-de-lis symbolizes the family of Scouting. The encircling rope symbolizes the unity and family of the World Scout Movement. Recognition of non-national Scouting organizations[edit] The needs of Scout youth in unusual situations has created some interesting permutations, answerable directly to the World Scout Bureau. These permutations fall generally into three categories: ""National"" Movements not operating within the boundaries of their original homelands, such as the Russian and Armenian exile groups;[10] Small, non-voting associations basically viewed by the BSIB as ""councils"", such as the Boy Scouts of the United Nations and the International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone[25] The less well-known directly registered ""mixed-nationality Troops"". Both the Boy Scouts of United Nations and the International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone have long since disbanded, and the only remaining directly registered Troop is the International Boy Scouts, Troop 1 located in Yokohama, Japan. In addition to these three groups a temporary recognition was extended by the BSIB to Scouts in displaced persons camps after World War II. In 1947 at the 11th International Conference the ""Displaced Persons Division"" of the BSIB was established to register and support Scouts in displaced person camps in Austria, Northern Italy, and Germany.[26] These Scouts did not receive the right of membership in the Boy Scouts International Conference but gained recognition as Scouts under the protection of the Bureau until they took up residence in a country that had a recognized National Scouting Organization, which they then could join.[27] The D.P. Division was closed on 30 June 1950.[28] The International Conference of the Boy Scout Movement decided to admit and recognise the exile Russian Scout group as the ""Representatives of Russian Scouting in Foreign Countries"" on 30 August 1922 and the Armenian Scouts in France were recognized as a ""National Movement on Foreign Soil"" on 30 April 1929.[10] The Boy Scouts of the United Nations began in 1945, and for years there was an active Boy Scouts of the United Nations with several troops at Parkway Village in New York City, with but 14 members in 1959. The International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone, a group in Panama with Scouts that claimed British and not Panamanian nationality was originally placed under the American Scouting overseas of the BSA but, in 1947, was transferred under the International Bureau. In 1957 the group had over 900 members and existed as a directly registered group until the late 60s. The third category in the directly registered groups, the ""mixed-nationality troops"", were registered after discussions concerning such troops took place at the 3rd International Conference of 1924[29] at which the BSIB was authorized to directly register such groups. It seems that the discussion at the 1924 International Conference was, at least in part, prompted by a letter to Baden-Powell from the Scoutmaster of one such troop in Yokohama, Japan.[30] Janning's troop became the first troop directly registered by the BSIB.[31] Only a few troops were directly registered as soon the practice was discontinued and new ""mixed"" groups were encouraged to join the National Scout Association of their country of residence. In 1955 only two such groups were still active, a troop in Iraq that disbanded that year,[32] and the first group to be registered, the International Troop 1 in Yokohama.[33] The international troop in Yokohama is the only remaining active troop of the small group of the originally directly registered mixed-nationality troops.[34] Publications[edit] Publications of WOSM include: Scouting 'Round the World: a book updated every three years with details on all WOSM member organizations; WorldInfo: a monthly circular distributed in electronic format with the help of Scoutnet.

The Africa Region services Scouting in Sub-Saharan Africa and neighboring islands that are recognized members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). Currently, the region has 39 member National Scout Associations/Organizations and 11 potential members. There are about one million registered Scouts in Africa, though it is suspected that there are about twice that number in the region. The large nations of Mali, Guinea-Bissau and the Central African Republic, and several smaller nations, are not yet WOSM members, for various reasons. This region is the counterpart of the Africa Region of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS).

At the 62nd ordinary session of the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on 21-23 June 1995, declared 13 March the Africa Scout Day.[citation needed] Africa Network Scout Fellowship[edit] The Africa Network Scout Fellowship is a forum where members of the United Kingdom Scout Association with a specific interest in Africa can share knowledge, ideas and experiences. It promotes the expansion of international Scouting, with a particular focus on building friendships in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Collectively the Africa Network Scout Fellowship members have experience in Angola, Botswana, Cameroon, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Nigeria, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The Africa Network Scout Fellowship assists all sections of the Scout Movement, in a variety of activities-whitewater rafting, community initiatives, mountaineering, construction projects and safari adventures. The Africa Network Scout Fellowship actively promotes expeditions to all parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and help on all aspects of an expedition, from initial planning, to British training camps, to the actual expedition itself. Africa Network Scout Fellowship meetings are held at varying locations throughout the United Kingdom.

You are hereHome / World Scouting World Scouting The Scout Movement is a voluntary non-political educational movement for young people, open to all without distinction of gender, origin, race or creed. Scouting offers young people the opportunity to develop their full emotional, intellectual, physical, social and spiritual potentials as individuals, as responsible global citizens, and as members of their local, national and international communities. The organization of the Scout Movement at the world level, “World Scouting”, is governed by the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). WOSM is an independent, non-political, non-governmental organisation that is made up of 164 National Scout Organizations (NSOs). These NSOs are located in 224 countries and territories around the world. With over 40 million members in some one million local community Scout Groups, WOSM is one of the largest youth movements in the world. Some seven million members in WOSM are adult volunteers who support local activities. Through peer-to-peer leadership, supported by adults, each local Scout Group embraces the same set of values illustrated in the Scout Promise and Law. Each of the one million local Scout Groups follows a similar system of non-formal education suited to the unique aspects of their local community. Purpose The purpose of WOSM is to promote unity and the understanding of Scouting's purpose and principles while facilitating its expansion and development. The organs of WOSM are the World Scout Conference, the World Scout Committee, and the World Scout Bureau.

WOSM was established in 1920, and has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. It is the counterpart of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS). The mission of WOSM is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Scout Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.[1] WOSM is organized into regions and operates with a conference, committee and bureau.

The World Scout Conference is the general assembly of Scouting and is composed of six delegates from each of the member Scout associations. If a country has more than one association, the associations form a federation for coordination and world representation. The basis for recognition and membership in the World Scout Conference includes adherence to the aims and principles of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, and independence from political involvement on the part of each member association.[2] The Conference meets every three years and is hosted by a member association. At the World Scout Conference basic cooperative efforts are agreed upon and a plan of mutual coordination is adopted. The Conference directed the move of the World Scout Bureau from Ottawa, Canada to Geneva on May 1, 1968.[3] Date Number Location Member Countries 1920 First World Scout Conference London 33 1922 Second World Scout Conference Paris 32 1924 Third World Scout Conference Copenhagen 34 1926 Fourth World Scout Conference Kandersteg 29 1929 Fifth World Scout Conference Birkenhead 33 1931 Sixth World Scout Conference Baden bei Wien 44 1933 Seventh World Scout Conference Gödöllő 31 1935 Eighth World Scout Conference Stockholm 28 1937 Ninth World Scout Conference The Hague 34 1939 10th World Scout Conference Edinburgh 27 1947 11th World Scout Conference Château de Rosny-sur-Seine 27 1949 12th World Scout Conference Elvesaeter 25 1951 13th World Scout Conference Salzburg 34 1953 14th World Scout Conference Vaduz 35 1955 15th World Scout Conference Niagara Falls, Ontario 44 1957 16th World Scout Conference Cambridge 52 1959 17th World Scout Conference New Delhi 35 1961 18th World Scout Conference Lisbon 50 1963 19th World Scout Conference Rhodes 52 1965 20th World Scout Conference Mexico City 59 1967 21st World Scout Conference Seattle 70 1969 22nd World Scout Conference Otaniemi 64 1971 23rd World Scout Conference Tokyo 71 1973 24th World Scout Conference Nairobi 77 1975 25th World Scout Conference Lundtoft 87 1977 26th World Scout Conference Montreal 81 1979 27th World Scout Conference Birmingham 81 1981 28th World Scout Conference Dakar 74 1983 29th World Scout Conference Dearborn 90 1985 30th World Scout Conference Munich 93 1988 31st World Scout Conference Melbourne 77 1990 32nd World Scout Conference Paris 1993 33rd World Scout Conference Sattahip 1996 34th World Scout Conference Oslo 108 1999 35th World Scout Conference Durban 116 2002 36th World Scout Conference Thessaloniki 126 2005 37th World Scout Conference Hammamet 122 2008 38th World Scout Conference Jeju-do 150 2011 39th World Scout Conference Curitiba World Scout Committee 1939-1955 version of the World Scout Emblem, used by the World Scout Committee The World Scout Committee is the chief executive body of the World Scout Conference and is composed of elected volunteers. The World Scout Committee represents World Scout Conference between the meetings of the full conference. The World Scout Committee is responsible for the implementation of the resolutions of the World Scout Conference and for acting on its behalf between its meetings. The Committee meets twice a year, usually in Geneva, Switzerland. Its Steering Committee, consisting of the Chairman, two Vice-Chairmen and the Secretary General, meet as needed.[4] The Committee is composed of 14 members. Twelve, each from a different country, are elected for six-year terms by the World Scout Conference. The members, elected without regard to their nationality, do not represent their country but the interests of the Movement as a whole. The Secretary General and the Treasurer of WOSM are ex-officio members of the Committee. The chairmen of the regional Scout committees participate in the World Scout Committee meetings in a consultative capacity.[5] The World Scout Committee has set up work streams to address the top strategic priorities, as defined by the World Scout Conference, which at present include: * Youth involvement * Volunteers in Scouting * Scouting's profile (communications, partnerships, resources) Standing committees include: * Audit * Budget * Constitutions * Honours and Awards *Working With Others- a consultative committee of the WOSM and the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), composed of members of the World Committee/World Board of both organizations * 2007 Task Force for the 100th Anniversary of Scouting, composed of members of the World Scout Committee, World Scout Bureau, World Scout Foundation, and The Scout Association of the United Kingdom Current members of the World Scout Committee Name Country Term to William F.

It was first awarded to Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell by a unanimous decision of the then-International Committee on the day of the institution of the Bronze Wolf in Stockholm in 1935. World Scout Bureau The World Scout Bureau is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland and has offices in six regional divisions: Template:Legend Template:Legend Template:Legend Template:Legend Template:Legend Template:Legend Template:Legend The World Scout Bureau (WSB, formerly the International Bureau) is the secretariat that carries out the instructions of the World Scout Conference and the World Scout Committee. The WSB is administered by the secretary general, who is supported by a small staff of technical resource personnel. The bureau staff helps associations improve and broaden their Scouting by training professionals and volunteers, establishing finance policies and money-raising techniques, improving community facilities and procedures, and assisting in marshaling the national resources of each country behind Scouting.[6] The staff also helps arrange global events such as the World Scout Jamborees, encourages regional events, and acts as a liaison between the Scouting movement and other international organizations. A major effort in the emerging nations is the extension of the universal Good Turn into an organization-wide effort for community development.[7] The World Organization of the Scout Movement is associated with the three World Scout Centres. The World Scout Jamboree is held roughly every four years under the auspices of the WOSM, with members of WAGGGS also invited. WOSM also organises the World Scout Moot, a Jamboree for 17-26 year olds, and has organised the World Scout Indaba, a gathering for Scout leaders. The World Scout Foundation is a perpetual fund governed by a separate Board of Governors and supported by donations for the development of Scouting programs throughout the world. The WOSM is the non-governmental organization (NGO), that represents the Scouting movement at the United Nations.[8] The WOSM and WAGGGS both have General Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council ECOSOC of the United Nations.[9] World Scout Centres World Scout Centre is a brand of the WOSM and actually used by three Scouting facilities in different countries. These facilities are operated by the corresponding regional divisions or by independent bodies: * Kandersteg International Scout Centre in Switzerland, operated by the Scouts International Home association * Cairo International Scout Centre in Egypt, operated by the Arab Region * Picarquín World Scout Centre in Chile, operated by the Interamerican Region Badge The WOSM membership badge, called the World Crest, is a purple, circular badge with a fleur-de-lis in the center, surrounded by a piece of rope tied with a reef knot (also called a square knot). The fleur-de-lis is an ancient symbol, originally used by Baden-Powell for the enlisted scouts of the British Army and subsequently adopted and modified for Scouting. The arrowhead represents the North point on a compass, and is intended to point Scouts on the path to service and unity. The three points on the fleur-de-lis represent the three duties, to God, self and others. The two five-point stars stand for truth and knowledge, with the ten points representing the ten points of the Scout Law (see below). The bond at the base of the fleur-de-lis shows the family of Scouting. The encircling rope symbolizes the unity and family of the World Scout Movement. History As a result of the first World Scout Jamboree at Olympia, London in 1920, leaders there created the Boy Scouts' International Conference. All 31 nations represented at Olympia were the charter members. A Bureau was established at 25, Buckingham Palace Road, London, and the then United Kingdom International Commissioner, Hubert S. Martin, was appointed as Honorary Director. The Boy Scouts' International Conference was later superseded by the World Scout Conference. The needs of Scout youth in unusual situations has created some interesting permutations, answerable directly to the World Scout Bureau. For years there was an active Boy Scouts of the United Nations with several troops at Parkway Village in New York City, with but 14 members in 1959. Also directly registered to the World Bureau were the 900 member International Boy Scouts of the Canal Zone,[10] as well as 84 Scouts of the European Coal and Steel Community, an early precursor to the European Union.

Such support pays dividends by reducing the severity and costs of climate impacts for people, including extreme weather, ecosystem loss and societal instability both at home and abroad. Over the last four years (see our coverage from 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020), Congress has sought to maintain U.S. finance for international climate action, in the face of repeated efforts by the Trump administration to drastically cut funding back. But while the United States has been treading water on climate finance, the rest of the world has moved ahead, and the climate crisis is only intensifying. In 2009, developed countries made a collective commitment to mobilize $100 billion a year in climate finance for developing countries between 2020 and 2025. As the largest cumulative greenhouse gas emitter, the United States has not been doing its fair share towards this goal. It is time for the United States to not just catch up, but to lead on climate finance — for the country's own sake as well as for others'. Climate change is a global phenomenon with significant local implications. Over the past five years, the United States has suffered $600 billion in direct losses from climate and weather-related events. Yet just $2.5 billion, or 0.07% of the federal budget each year, supports international efforts to address climate change. President Joe Biden has made climate change a top priority, and this week his Special Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, told the international community ""we intend to make good on our climate finance pledge."" Biden's recent Executive Order, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, charged his team to develop a climate finance plan in the next three months. There are four key areas of climate finance that the administration should prioritize to bolster U.S. influence and impact as it reengages in global climate action. International Climate Finance in the 2021 Funding Bill First, it's important to look at what the fiscal year 2021 spending package passed by Congress in December 2020 did for international climate funding. This provides the baseline from which the Biden administration must build. $811 million in bilateral allocations for environmental programs addressing biodiversity protection, sustainable landscapes, renewable energy and adaptation: Congress directed that at least $811 million in bilateral assistance — given directly to other governments — be used for environmental objectives, a $5 million increase compared to fiscal year 2020. These amounts, which come primarily from the Development Assistance and the Economic Support Fund, are similar to the Obama administration's spending. But whereas President Obama voluntarily supported these areas, starting in fiscal year 2020 Congress enshrined renewable energy and adaptation as new mandatory lines in the spending bills (alongside existing lines for sustainable landscapes and biodiversity) to prevent the Trump administration from cutting them. $140 million for the Global Environment Facility: This international fund has financed projects that help developing countries meet commitments under a variety of global environmental agreements for 29 years, and has enjoyed long-standing bipartisan support in Congress. Despite the Trump administration's repeated efforts to halve U.S. contributions, Congress has maintained Global Environment Facility funding over the past four years. $1.48 billion for multilateral development banks: These banks are significant sources of climate finance for developing countries, providing $46 billion in climate finance in 2019. The United States is a major shareholder in these institutions. Funding for 2021 was one area where the Trump administration and Congress were in full agreement. $32 million for the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund: This fund helps developing countries reduce their use of ozone-depleting chemicals, which include several powerful greenhouse gases. The United States maintained funding at the same level as last year. $6.4 million for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC): These UN entities support climate science and international negotiations, respectively. The United States provides around two-fifths of the IPCC's total budget and one-fifth of the UNFCCC's. The 2021 bill maintained funding at the same level as last year, but this amount is less than the $10 million previously provided under Obama. Hard work by many members of Congress ensured overall U.S. climate finance did not significantly decline during the Trump administration. But as other countries have continued to scale up their funding the U.S. has still fallen down the rankings. The Biden administration must make up for lost time by rapidly scaling up climate funding and restoring the country to a leading role. Next Steps on Climate Finance for the Biden Administration U.S. reengagement on climate finance is not only a matter of how much, but also where funding is allocated. The complex landscape of climate finance has many possible channels, but some have more impact than others. Here are five top priorities for the Biden administration on international climate finance: 1. Fulfill and Double the US Pledge to the Green Climate Fund Trump stopped U.S. contributions to the Green Climate Fund (GCF), which has a mandate to help countries build low-carbon, resilient economies and take ambitious action under the Paris Agreement. Biden has said he would ""recommit the United States to the Green Climate Fund,"" and it should be number one on his list of international climate finance priorities. The Fund gives developing countries an equal voice in decision-making, and it has some of the strongest policies of any financial institution promoting gender responsiveness and Indigenous peoples' rights. It delivers funding through a diverse range of more than 100 organizations, from major U.S. investors to local businesses and nonprofits in developing countries. While the GCF has faced problems with slow decision making in the past, a new voting procedure instituted in 2019 has led to far more efficient delivery. Last year the Fund approved a record $2 billion for 37 projects, more than any other international climate fund. Obama pledged $3 billion to the GCF in 2014 but only delivered $1 billion before leaving office, meaning the United States still owes $2 billion from that original pledge. In 2019, most other developed countries made a new round of pledges, with many doubling their original commitments. Resumed U.S. contributions to the GCF would deliver the most diplomatic bang for the buck. The GCF was a key part of the grand bargain that underpinned the Paris Agreement: that poorer countries would undertake more climate action but needed increased support from richer countries to do so. Developing countries, as well as the U.S. climate movement, have made clear that ambitious backing for the GCF is a key test of Biden's recommitment to global climate leadership. The GCF now has significant support in Congress: for the first time last year, the House of Representatives requested funding for the GCF. With Democrats also gaining control of the Senate, and members of the pivotal Appropriations Committee backing the Fund, the potential for GCF appropriations has never looked better. To get back up to speed, Biden should deliver the outstanding $2 billion from the country's existing pledge and make a new, more ambitious commitment of $6 billion to match peers who have already doubled their pledges. 2. Contribute to Other Multilateral Climate Institutions The United States should become a first-time contributor to the Adaptation Fund, which helps developing countries adapt to climate impacts. Like the GCF, the Adaptation Fund has an official role in implementing the Paris Agreement. Developing countries are strong champions of the Adaptation Fund because of its track record in quickly delivering funding to small-scale projects that make tangible differences to people's lives. The Fund has also pioneered innovative ways to give developing countries more say over how climate finance is spent, including giving developing countries a majority in its Board, and granting funding directly to recipient country institutions. A U.S. contribution to the Adaptation Fund would signal to the world that the Biden administration will fully and actively support the Paris Agreement, and that it understands the priorities of vulnerable countries. The Adaptation Fund is much smaller than the GCF, receiving just over $1 billion in cumulative contributions over 12 years. Germany is the largest contributor, pledging around $60 million each year. A U.S. contribution on that scale would provide a massive boost to the Adaptation Fund's important work. Similarly, the United States should make a new pledge to the Least Developed Countries Fund — which provides adaptation funding to the poorest countries — at a similar level to the $51 million it pledged in 2015. In 2021, countries will begin negotiating the Global Environment Facility's eighth replenishment, for 2022-2026. The United States should come prepared with an ambitious pledge that makes up for not increasing contributions at the last replenishment in 2018. Biden should also continue support for the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund, and restore full funding for the IPCC and UNFCCC. 3. Integrate Climate Throughout All Development Funding Biden promised to ""fully integrate climate change into foreign policy."" To ensure a coherent approach, his administration must coordinate across the government agencies that extend development assistance to other countries, including the Departments of State and Treasury, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation. The administration should work with Congress to increase bilateral funding allocated in the annual appropriations bills for climate adaptation, renewable energy and sustainable landscapes. In addition to these specific allocations, the administration should also mainstream climate across all its development spending. This does not mean cutting spending from other priorities such as healthcare, education and gender equality, but that as part of an overall increase in the development assistance budget, all spending would take into account the impacts of projects on the climate — and of climate change on projects. This includes ending overseas financing for fossil fuels as part of the administration's commitment to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies. Previous efforts by the Obama administration to mainstream climate were reversed by Trump, so the Biden administration should work closely with Congress to ensure these reforms have longevity. 4. Push Development Banks to Align with the Paris Agreement The multilateral development banks are major climate finance contributors. But they also have a long history of financing fossil fuels. In 2018, these banks committed to align their activities with the Paris Agreement, but they have made slow progress. The heads of both the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank are Trump appointees, so this is perhaps unsurprising. The United States is a major shareholder in most multilateral development banks. The banks' leadership are likely to ask for increased funding from the Biden administration, which gives the United States significant influence. For example, last year House Financial Services Committee chair Rep. Maxine Waters secured important reforms to increase accountability and transparency of the World Bank's private sector arm as part of a U.S. capital increase. The Biden administration and Congress are in a strong position to push multilateral development banks to move faster toward Paris alignment, including ending funding for fossil fuels, and ensuring their pandemic recovery funding helps countries rebuild cleaner, more resilient societies. The administration should use all the tools at its disposal, including updating the Treasury guidelines for how U.S. representatives vote in development banks. President Biden's January 27th Executive Order provides a mandate to deliver on all four of these priorities. The administration's forthcoming climate finance plan should set out concrete steps for how the United States will meet its responsibilities and become a leader in supporting developing countries to take ambitious action, which benefits both the United States and the world.

Since 2010, access to electricity has increased by more than 7% annually across the country. This significant milestone is largely thanks to the country’s National Electrification Strategy and the use of integrated approaches, including both the expansion of grid infrastructure and off-grid solar home systems. According to Kenya Census data, while grid-powered homes grew steadily from 16% in 2005 to 50.4% in 2019, solar-powered homes also tracked considerable growth, increasing from about 2% to 19% during the same period. Source based on KNBS 2009 & 2019, KIHBS 2005 & 2015. At a national level, these advances are encouraging; however, progress varies across the country. As required by Kenya’s national Energy Act of 2019, all the country’s 47 counties are mandated to develop their own energy plans. If done well, these plans can help bring reliable, affordable electricity to the millions of Kenyans still without power. Yet most counties lack the necessary capacity and geospatial data and technology to develop such plans. WRI’s Energy Access Explorer combines recent census data and high-resolution geospatial information, enabling stakeholders to draw insights on the current state of electricity access to inform their energy plans moving forward. Looking at Kenya’s electricity evolution over the past several years can help inform what energy planners do next. Here’s what we know: Grid and distributed renewable energy are complementary strategies for governments to consider – as has been done in Kenya. The cost of solar home systems to electrify remote households is often lower than the cost of grid-based electricity. From a policy and consumer standpoint, it also offers advantages. Data and tools available to policymakers can help look at the demographic characteristics of the population at a subnational level and overlay the current infrastructure and resource availability to help target energy poverty alleviation efforts. These opportunities and actions are apparent in reviewing the data, as demonstrated by the Energy Access Explorer, a tool that can support integrated energy planning to optimize grid extension and distributed renewable energy strategies. 1. Many counties underserved by the grid have the highest proportion of solar-powered homes. Households in the 10 counties with the highest penetration of solar home systems use less grid power than the national rural average. Many of these counties are concentrated in western Kenya – an area with many “under-grid households,” meaning that households are close to the grid, but not connected. Source based on KNBS, 2019. Source: Energy Access Explorer based on KNBS 2019 / Energy Access Explorer The data in these 10 counties shows how solar home systems can play a key role in providing power in areas with no, limited, unreliable or costly grid power. 2. Solar home systems are an accessible option among Kenya’s counties with medium-to-high levels of poverty. The 10 counties with the highest number of solar home systems are in areas where at least 50% of the population experiences poverty. In these areas, solar is often the most affordable energy option. This could be driven by a number of variables, including an historical cost reduction of solar panels and batteries — two main components of solar home systems. More importantly, solar home systems are often paired with energy-efficient appliances (LED lighting, mobile phone chargers, radios, etc.), and are sized and customized for household energy needs. The energy needs of some Kenyan households could be fully met by solar home systems, alleviating the need for expensive grid infrastructure. Source: Energy Access Explorer 3. Counties with low electricity access have high solar potential. According to 2019 census data, seven counties in northern Kenya experience both a low adoption of solar home systems and the grid. This is an indication that homes in these counties have poor access to electricity. Nearly 94% of the total population in these underserved counties live in areas with a high poverty rate1, but they also have some of the highest solar potential in Kenya2 . Extending the grid in these areas would be costly, making smaller solar home systems a more promising option to expand energy access. It is noteworthy that all these counties are part of the Kenya Off-Grid Solar Access Project (KOSAP), which aims to provide electricity to parts of the country that are not served by the national grid.3 Expanding Energy Access in Kenya’s Hardest-to-Reach Places Geospatial data on demographics, socio-economic activities, energy resource availability, power infrastructure, environment, access to finance, and more can play a key role in building more inclusive energy plans, while also accounting for critical development outcomes across Kenya. Energy Access Explorer aggregates these often-siloed geospatial data and provides simple-to-use, customizable analysis to prioritize areas of interest. EAE is already being used by energy planners to support inclusive energy planning in Kenya‘s Kitui and Narok counties. This data-driven, integrated approach can be scaled to new geographies with minimal resources, thanks to the open source and fully adaptable nature of the Energy Access Explorer.

Geospatial tools can support a new generation of integrated energy planning efforts. Kenya’s approach – as demonstrated here – offers a pathway for other countries to follow as they work to accelerate energy access. 1Percentage in poverty [Multidimensional Poverty Index] above 70% 2Global Horizontal Irradiation above 1,800 (kWh/m2) 3Jointly implemented by the Ministry of Energy, the Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) and the Rural Electrification Agency (REA).

The city was named for George Washington, the first president of the United States and a Founding Father,[9] and the federal district is named after Columbia, a female personification of the nation. As the seat of the U.S. federal government and several international organizations, the city is an important world political capital.[10] It is one of the most visited cities in the U.S., seeing over 20 million visitors in 2016.[11][12] The U.S. Constitution provides for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress; the district is therefore not a part of any U.S. state (nor is it one itself). The signing of the Residence Act on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River near the country's East Coast. The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the national capital, and Congress held its first session there in 1800. In 1801, the territory, formerly part of Maryland and Virginia (including the settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria), officially became recognized as the federal district. In 1846, Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia, including the city of Alexandria; in 1871, it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the district. There have been efforts to make the city into a state since the 1880s, a movement that has gained momentum in recent years, and a statehood bill passed the House of Representatives in 2021.[13] The city is divided into quadrants centered on the Capitol Building, and there are as many as 131 neighborhoods. According to the 2020 Census,[14] it has a population of 689,545, which makes it the 20th-most populous city in the U.S. and gives it a population larger than that of two U.S. states: Wyoming and Vermont.[15] Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek.[16] Washington's metropolitan area, the country's sixth-largest (including parts of Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia), had a 2019 estimated population of 6.3 million residents.[17] The three branches of the U.S. federal government are centered in the district: Congress (legislative), the president (executive), and the Supreme Court (judicial). Washington is home to many national monuments and museums, primarily situated on or around the National Mall. The city hosts 177 foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of many international organizations, trade unions, non-profits, lobbying groups, and professional associations, including the World Bank Group, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, the AARP, the National Geographic Society, the Human Rights Campaign, the International Finance Corporation, and the American Red Cross. A locally elected mayor and a 13-member council have governed the district since 1973. Congress maintains supreme authority over the city and may overturn local laws. D.C. residents elect a non-voting, at-large congressional delegate to the House of Representatives, but the district has no representation in the Senate. District voters choose three presidential electors in accordance with the Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1961.

Further information: History of Washington, D.C.; Timeline of Washington, D.C.; and District of Columbia (until 1871) Various tribes of the Algonquian-speaking Piscataway people (also known as the Conoy) inhabited the lands around the Potomac River when Europeans first visited the area in the early 17th century. One group known as the Nacotchtank (also called the Nacostines by Catholic missionaries) maintained settlements around the Anacostia River within the present-day District of Columbia. Conflicts with European colonists and neighboring tribes forced the relocation of the Piscataway people, some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near Point of Rocks, Maryland.[18] In his Federalist No. 43, published January 23, 1788, James Madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety.[19] Five years earlier, a band of unpaid soldiers had besieged Congress while its members were meeting in Philadelphia. Known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, the event emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own security.[20] Article One, Section Eight, of the Constitution permits the establishment of a ""District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States"".[21] However, the Constitution does not specify a location for the capital. In what is now known as the Compromise of 1790, Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson agreed that the federal government would pay each state's remaining Revolutionary War debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the Southern United States.[22][a] Foundation On July 9, 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act, which approved the creation of a national capital on the Potomac River. The exact location was to be selected by President George Washington, who signed the bill into law on July 16. Formed from land donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles (16 km) on each side, totaling 100 square miles (259 km2).[23][b] Two pre-existing settlements were included in the territory: the port of Georgetown, Maryland, founded in 1751,[24] and the city of Alexandria, Virginia, founded in 1749.[25] During 1791–92, a team under Andrew Ellicott, including Ellicott's brothers Joseph and Benjamin and African-American astronomer Benjamin Banneker, surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point.[26] Many of the stones are still standing.[27] A new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the Potomac, to the east of Georgetown. On September 9, 1791, the three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. The same day, the federal district was named Columbia (a feminine form of ""Columbus""), which was a poetic name for the United States commonly in use at that time.[28][29] Congress held its first session there on November 17, 1800.[30][31] Congress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government. Further, the unincorporated area within the district was organized into two counties: the County of Washington to the east of the Potomac and the County of Alexandria to the west.[32] After the passage of this Act, citizens living in the district were no longer considered residents of Maryland or Virginia, which therefore ended their representation in Congress.[33] Burning during the War of 1812 Main article: War of 1812 Following their victory at the Battle of Bladensburg, the British entered Washington, D.C., burning down buildings, including the White House. On August 24–25, 1814, in a raid known as the Burning of Washington, British forces invaded the capital during the War of 1812. The Capitol, Treasury, and White House were burned and gutted during the attack.[34] Most government buildings were repaired quickly; however, the Capitol was largely under construction at the time and was not completed in its current form until 1868.[35] Retrocession and the Civil War See also: District of Columbia retrocession and Washington, D.C., in the American Civil War President Abraham Lincoln insisted that construction of the United States Capitol dome continue during the American Civil War (1861). In the 1830s, the district's southern territory of Alexandria went into economic decline partly due to neglect by Congress.[36] The city of Alexandria was a major market in the American slave trade, and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in Congress would end slavery in the district, further depressing the economy. Alexandria's citizens petitioned Virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the district, through a process known as retrocession.[37] The Virginia General Assembly voted in February 1846 to accept the return of Alexandria. On July 9, 1846, Congress agreed to return all the territory that Virginia had ceded. Therefore, the district's area consists only of the portion originally donated by Maryland.[36] Confirming the fears of pro-slavery Alexandrians, the Compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the district, although not slavery itself.[38] The outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 led to the expansion of the federal government and notable growth in the district's population, including a large influx of freed slaves.[39] President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act in 1862, which ended slavery in the district of Columbia and freed about 3,100 enslaved persons, nine months prior to the Emancipation Proclamation.[40] In 1868, Congress granted the district's African American male residents the right to vote in municipal elections.[39] Growth and redevelopment By 1870, the district's population had grown 75% from the previous census to nearly 132,000 residents.[41] Despite the city's growth, Washington still had dirt roads and lacked basic sanitation. Some members of Congress suggested moving the capital further west, but President Ulysses S. Grant refused to consider such a proposal.[42] Congress passed the Organic Act of 1871, which repealed the individual charters of the cities of Washington and Georgetown, and created a new territorial government for the whole District of Columbia.[43] President Grant appointed Alexander Robey Shepherd to the position of governor in 1873. Shepherd authorized large-scale projects that greatly modernized the City of Washington, but ultimately bankrupted the district government. In 1874, Congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three-member Board of Commissioners.[44] The city's first motorized streetcars began service in 1888. They generated growth in areas of the district beyond the City of Washington's original boundaries. Washington's urban plan was expanded throughout the district in the following decades.[45] Georgetown's street grid and other administrative details were formally merged to those of the legal City of Washington in 1895.[46] However, the city had poor housing conditions and strained public works. The district was the first city in the nation to undergo urban renewal projects as part of the ""City Beautiful movement"" in the early 1900s.[47] Increased federal spending as a result of the New Deal in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings, memorials, and museums in the district,[48] though the chairman of the House Subcommittee on District Appropriations Ross A. Collins from Mississippi justified cuts to funds for welfare and education for local residents, saying that ""my constituents wouldn't stand for spending money on niggers.""[49] World War II further increased government activity, adding to the number of federal employees in the capital;[50] by 1950, the district's population reached its peak of 802,178 residents.[41] Civil rights and home rule era Crowds surrounding the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool during the March on Washington, 1963 External video 1960s Washington DC, 4K from 35mm Kinolibrary The Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1961, granting the district three votes in the Electoral College for the election of president and vice president, but still no voting representation in Congress.[51] After the assassination of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., on April 4, 1968, riots broke out in the district, primarily in the U Street, 14th Street, 7th Street, and H Street corridors, centers of black residential and commercial areas. The riots raged for three days until more than 13,600 federal troops and D.C. Army National Guardsmen stopped the violence. Many stores and other buildings were burned; rebuilding was not completed until the late 1990s.[52] In 1973, Congress enacted the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, providing for an elected mayor and thirteen-member council for the district.[53] In 1975, Walter Washington became the first elected and first black mayor of the district.[54] Geography Main article: Geography of Washington, D.C.

Due to the District of Columbia retrocession, the city has a total area of 68.34 square miles (177 km2), of which 61.05 square miles (158.1 km2) is land and 7.29 square miles (18.9 km2) (10.67%) is water.[55] The district is bordered by Montgomery County, Maryland to the northwest; Prince George's County, Maryland to the east; Arlington County, Virginia to the west; and Alexandria, Virginia to the south. Washington, D.C., is 38 miles (61 km) from Baltimore, 124 miles (200 km) from Philadelphia and 227 miles (365 km) from New York City. The south bank of the Potomac River forms the district's border with Virginia and has two major tributaries: the Anacostia River and Rock Creek.[56] Tiber Creek, a natural watercourse that once passed through the National Mall, was fully enclosed underground during the 1870s.[57] The creek also formed a portion of the now-filled Washington City Canal, which allowed passage through the city to the Anacostia River from 1815 until the 1850s.[58] The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal starts in Georgetown and was used during the 19th century to bypass the Little Falls of the Potomac River, located at the northwest edge of Washington at the Atlantic Seaboard fall line.[59] The highest natural elevation in the district is 409 feet (125 m) above sea level at Fort Reno Park in upper northwest Washington.[60] The lowest point is sea level at the Potomac River.[61] The geographic center of Washington is near the intersection of 4th and L Streets NW.[62][63][64] The district has 7,464 acres (30.21 km2) of parkland, about 19% of the city's total area and the second-highest percentage among high-density U.S. cities.[65] This factor contributed to Washington, D.C., being ranked as third in the nation for park access and quality in the 2018 ParkScore ranking of the park systems of the 100 most populous cities in the United States, according to the nonprofit Trust for Public Land.[66] The National Park Service manages most of the 9,122 acres (36.92 km2) of city land owned by the U.S. government.[67] Rock Creek Park is a 1,754-acre (7.10 km2) urban forest in Northwest Washington, which extends 9.3 miles (15.0 km) through a stream valley that bisects the city. Established in 1890, it is the country's fourth-oldest national park and is home to a variety of plant and animal species, including raccoon, deer, owls, and coyotes.[68] Other National Park Service properties include the C&O Canal National Historical Park, the National Mall and Memorial Parks, Theodore Roosevelt Island, Columbia Island, Fort Dupont Park, Meridian Hill Park, Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens, and Anacostia Park.[69] The D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation maintains the city's 900 acres (3.6 km2) of athletic fields and playgrounds, 40 swimming pools, and 68 recreation centers.[70] The U.S. Department of Agriculture operates the 446-acre (1.80 km2) U.S. National Arboretum in Northeast Washington.[71] Climate Washington is in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen: Cfa).[72] The Trewartha classification is defined as an oceanic climate (Do).[73] Winters are usually cool with light snow, and summers are hot and humid. The district is in plant hardiness zone 8a near downtown, and zone 7b elsewhere in the city, indicating a humid subtropical climate.[74] Spring and fall are mild to warm, while winter is cool with annual snowfall averaging 15.5 inches (39 cm). Winter temperatures average around 38 °F (3 °C) from mid-December to mid-February.[75] However, winter temperatures in excess of 60 °F (16 °C) are not uncommon.[76] Summers are hot and humid with a July daily average of 79.8 °F (26.6 °C) and average daily relative humidity around 66%, which can cause moderate personal discomfort. Heat indices regularly approach 100 °F (38 °C) at the height of summer.[77] The combination of heat and humidity in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms, some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area.[78] Blizzards affect Washington, on average, once every four to six years. The most violent storms are called ""nor'easters"", which often affect large sections of the East Coast.[79] From January 27 to 28, 1922, the city officially received 28 inches (71 cm) of snowfall, the largest snowstorm since official measurements began in 1885.[80] According to notes kept at the time, the city received between 30 and 36 inches (76 and 91 cm) from a snowstorm in January 1772.[81] The Washington Monument, seen across the Tidal Basin during 2007's National Cherry Blossom Festival Hurricanes (or their remnants) occasionally track through the area in late summer and early fall. However, they are often weak by the time they reach Washington, partly due to the city's inland location.[82] Flooding of the Potomac River, however, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, has been known to cause extensive property damage in the neighborhood of Georgetown.[83] Precipitation occurs throughout the year.[84] Washington's climate will grow warmer and rainfall will increase as the result of climate change.[85] The highest recorded temperature was 106 °F (41 °C) on August 6, 1918, and on July 20, 1930.[86] while the lowest recorded temperature was −15 °F (−26 °C) on February 11, 1899, right before the Great Blizzard of 1899.[79] During a typical year, the city averages about 37 days at or above 90 °F (32 °C) and 64 nights at or below the freezing mark (32 °F or 0 °C).[75] On average, the first day with a minimum at or below freezing is November 18 and the last day is March 27.[87][88] vteClimate data for Washington, D.C.

The L'Enfant Plan for Washington, D.C., as revised by Andrew Ellicott in 1792 Washington, D.C., is a planned city. In 1791, President Washington commissioned Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant, a French-born architect and city planner, to design the new capital. He enlisted Scottish surveyor Alexander Ralston to help lay out the city plan.[93] The L'Enfant Plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles, providing room for open space and landscaping.[94] He based his design on plans of cities such as Paris, Amsterdam, Karlsruhe, and Milan that Thomas Jefferson had sent to him.[95] L'Enfant's design also envisioned a garden-lined ""grand avenue"" approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) in length and 400 feet (120 m) wide in the area that is now the National Mall.[96] President Washington dismissed L'Enfant in March 1792 due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capital's construction. Andrew Ellicott, who had worked with L'Enfant surveying the city, was then tasked with completing the design. Though Ellicott made revisions to the original plans—including changes to some street patterns—L'Enfant is still credited with the overall design of the city.[97] Construction of the 12-story Cairo Apartment Building (1894) spurred building height restrictions. By the early 20th century, L'Enfant's vision of a grand national capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings, including a railroad station on the National Mall. Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core.[47] What became known as the McMillan Plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the Capitol grounds and the National Mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system. The plan is thought to have largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design.[94] By law, Washington's skyline is low and sprawling. The federal Height of Buildings Act of 1910 allows buildings that are no taller than the width of the adjacent street, plus 20 feet (6.1 m).[98] Despite popular belief, no law has ever limited buildings to the height of the United States Capitol Building or the 555-foot (169 m) Washington Monument,[64] which remains the district's tallest structure. City leaders have criticized the height restriction as a primary reason why the district has limited affordable housing and traffic problems caused by suburban sprawl.[98] The district is divided into four quadrants of unequal area: Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), Southeast (SE), and Southwest (SW). The axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the U.S. Capitol building.[99] All road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location and house numbers generally correspond with the number of blocks away from the Capitol. Most streets are set out in a grid pattern with east–west streets named with letters (e.g., C Street SW), north–south streets with numbers (e.g., 4th Street NW), and diagonal avenues, many of which are named after states.[99] The Georgetown neighborhood is known for its historic Federal-style rowhouses. The City of Washington was bordered by Boundary Street to the north (renamed Florida Avenue in 1890), Rock Creek to the west, and the Anacostia River to the east.[45][94] Washington's street grid was extended, where possible, throughout the district starting in 1888.[100] Georgetown's streets were renamed in 1895.[46] Some streets are particularly noteworthy, such as Pennsylvania Avenue—which connects the White House to the Capitol, and K Street—which houses the offices of many lobbying groups.[101] Constitution Avenue and Independence Avenue, located on the north and south sides of the National Mall, respectively, are home to many of Washington's iconic museums, including the Smithsonian Institution buildings, the National Archives Building. Washington hosts 177 foreign embassies, constituting approximately 297 buildings beyond the more than 1,600 residential properties owned by foreign countries, many of which are on a section of Massachusetts Avenue informally known as Embassy Row.[102] Architecture Meridian Hill Park, in Columbia Heights The architecture of Washington varies greatly. Six of the top 10 buildings in the American Institute of Architects' 2007 ranking of ""America's Favorite Architecture"" are in the District of Columbia:[103] the White House, the Washington National Cathedral, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial, the United States Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The neoclassical, Georgian, gothic, and modern architectural styles are all reflected among those six structures and many other prominent edifices in Washington. Notable exceptions include buildings constructed in the French Second Empire style such as the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.[104] Outside downtown Washington, architectural styles are even more varied. Historic buildings are designed primarily in the Queen Anne, Châteauesque, Richardsonian Romanesque, Georgian revival, Beaux-Arts, and a variety of Victorian styles. Rowhouses are especially prominent in areas developed after the Civil War and typically follow Federalist and late Victorian designs.[105] Georgetown's Old Stone House was built in 1765, making it the oldest-standing original building in the city.[106] Founded in 1789, Georgetown University features a mix of Romanesque and Gothic Revival architecture.[104] The Ronald Reagan Building is the largest building in the district with a total area of approximately 3.1 million square feet (288,000 m2).[107] Demographics Main article: Demographics of Washington, D.C.

When measured on a decade-over-decade basis, this continues a growth trend since 2000, following a half-century of population decline.[114] But on a year-over-year basis, the July 2019 census count shows a population decline of 16,000 individuals over the preceding 12-month period.[115] Washington was the 24th most populous place in the United States as of 2010[update].[116] According to data from 2010, commuters from the suburbs increase the district's daytime population to over a million.[117] If the district were a state it would rank 49th in population, ahead of Vermont and Wyoming.[118] The Washington Metropolitan Area, which includes the district and surrounding suburbs, is the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the United States with an estimated six million residents in 2014.[119] When the Washington area is included with Baltimore and its suburbs, the Baltimore–Washington Metropolitan Area had a population exceeding 9.8 million residents in 2020, the third-largest combined statistical area in the country.[120] According to 2017 Census Bureau data, the population of Washington, D.C., was 47.1% Black or African American, 45.1% White (36.8% non-Hispanic White), 4.3% Asian, 0.6% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Individuals from two or more races made up 2.7% of the population. Hispanics of any race made up 11.0% of the district's population.[118] Map of racial distribution in Washington, D.C., according to the 2010 U.S. Census. Each dot is 25 people: White, Black, Asian, Hispanic or Other (yellow) Washington has had a significant African American population since the city's foundation.[121] African American residents composed about 30% of the district's total population between 1800 and 1940.[41] The black population reached a peak of 70% by 1970, but has since steadily declined due to many African Americans moving to the surrounding suburbs. Partly as a result of gentrification, there was a 31.4% increase in the non-Hispanic white population and an 11.5% decrease in the black population between 2000 and 2010.[122] According to a study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, D.C. has experienced more ""intense"" gentrification than any other American city, with 40% of neighborhoods gentrified.[123] About 17% of D.C. residents were age 18 or younger in 2010, lower than the U.S. average of 24%. However, at 34 years old, the district had the lowest median age compared to the 50 states.[124] As of 2010[update], there were an estimated 81,734 immigrants living in Washington, D.C.[125] Major sources of immigration include El Salvador, Vietnam, and Ethiopia, with a concentration of Salvadorans in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood.[126] Researchers found that there were 4,822 same-sex couples in the District of Columbia in 2010, about 2% of total households.[127] Legislation authorizing same-sex marriage passed in 2009, and the district began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in March 2010.[128] A 2007 report found that about a third of district residents were functionally illiterate, compared to a national rate of about one in five. This is attributed in part to immigrants who are not proficient in English.[129] As of 2011[update], 85% of D.C. residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language.[130] Half of residents had at least a four-year college degree in 2006.[125] In 2017, the median household income in D.C. was $77,649;[131] also in 2017, D.C. residents had a personal income per capita of $50,832 (higher than any of the 50 states).[131][132] However, 19% of residents were below the poverty level in 2005, higher than any state except Mississippi. In 2019, the poverty rate stood at 14.7%.[133][g][135] Of the district's population, 17% is Baptist, 13% is Catholic, 6% is evangelical Protestant, 4% is Methodist, 3% is Episcopalian/Anglican, 3% is Jewish, 2% is Eastern Orthodox, 1% is Pentecostal, 1% is Buddhist, 1% is Adventist, 1% is Lutheran, 1% is Muslim, 1% is Presbyterian, 1% is Mormon, and 1% is Hindu.[136][h] As of 2010[update], more than 90% of D.C. residents had health insurance coverage, the second-highest rate in the nation. This is due in part to city programs that help provide insurance to low-income individuals who do not qualify for other types of coverage.[137] A 2009 report found that at least three percent of district residents have HIV or AIDS, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) characterizes as a ""generalized and severe"" epidemic.[138] Crime Main article: Crime in Washington, D.C. See also: List of law enforcement agencies in the District of Columbia D.C. police on Harley-Davidson motorcycles escort a protest in 2018. Crime in Washington, D.C., is concentrated in areas associated with poverty, drug abuse, and gangs. A 2010 study found that 5 percent of city blocks accounted for more than 25% of the district's total crimes.[139] The more affluent neighborhoods of Northwest Washington are typically safe, especially in areas with concentrations of government operations, such as Downtown Washington, D.C., Foggy Bottom, Embassy Row, and Penn Quarter, but reports of violent crime increase in poorer neighborhoods generally concentrated in the eastern portion of the city.[139] Approximately 60,000 residents are ex-convicts.[140] In 2012, Washington's annual murder count had dropped to 88, the lowest total since 1961.[141] The murder rate has since risen from that historic low, though it remains close to half the rate of the early 2000s.[142] Washington was once described as the ""murder capital"" of the United States during the early 1990s.[143] The number of murders peaked in 1991 at 479, but the level of violence then began to decline significantly.[144] In 2016, the district's Metropolitan Police Department tallied 135 homicides, a 53% increase from 2012 but a 17% decrease from 2015.[145] Many neighborhoods such as Columbia Heights and Logan Circle are becoming safer and vibrant. However, incidents of robberies and thefts have remained higher in these areas because of increased nightlife activity and greater numbers of affluent residents.[146] Even still, citywide reports of both property and violent crimes have declined by nearly half since their most recent highs in the mid-1990s.[147] On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held in District of Columbia v. Heller that the city's 1976 handgun ban violated the right to keep and bear arms as protected under the Second Amendment.[148] However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban.[149] In addition to the district's own Metropolitan Police Department, many federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city as well—most visibly the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.[150] Economy See also the categories Companies based in Washington, D.C. and Non-profit organizations based in Washington, D.C. Federal Triangle, between Constitution Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue. The U.S. federal government accounts for about 29% of D.C. jobs. Washington has a growing, diversified economy with an increasing percentage of professional and business service jobs.[151] The district's gross state product in 2018-Q2 was $141 billion.[152] The Washington Metropolitan Area's gross product was $435 billion in 2014, making it the sixth-largest metropolitan economy in the United States.[153] Between 2009 and 2016, GDP per capita in Washington has consistently ranked on the very top among U.S. states.[154] In 2016, at $160,472, its GDP per capita is almost three times as high as that of Massachusetts, which was ranked second in the nation.[154] As of 2011[update], the Washington Metropolitan Area had an unemployment rate of 6.2%; the second-lowest rate among the 49 largest metro areas in the nation.[155] The District of Columbia itself had an unemployment rate of 9.8% during the same time period.[156] In December 2017, 25% of the employees in Washington, D.C., were employed by a federal governmental agency.[157][158] This is thought to immunize Washington, D.C., to national economic downturns because the federal government continues operations even during recessions.[159] Many organizations such as law firms, defense contractors, civilian contractors, nonprofit organizations, lobbying firms, trade unions, industry trade groups, and professional associations have their headquarters in or near Washington, D.C., in order to be close to the federal government.[101] The city of Rosslyn, Virginia, located across the Potomac River from D.C., serves as a base of operations for several Fortune 500 companies, due to the building height restrictions in place within the District of Columbia. In 2018, Amazon announced they would build ""HQ 2"" in the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia.[160] Tourism is Washington's second-largest industry. Approximately 18.9 million visitors contributed an estimated $4.8 billion to the local economy in 2012.[161] The district also hosts nearly 200 foreign embassies and international organizations such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organization of American States, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Pan American Health Organization. In 2008, the foreign diplomatic corps in Washington employed about 10,000 people and contributed an estimated $400 million annually to the local economy.[102] The district has growing industries not directly related to government, especially in the areas of education, finance, public policy, and scientific research. Georgetown University, George Washington University, Washington Hospital Center, Children's National Medical Center and Howard University are the top five non-government-related employers in the city as of 2009[update].[162] According to statistics compiled in 2011, four of the largest 500 companies in the country were headquartered in the district.[163] In the 2021 Global Financial Centres Index, Washington was ranked as having the 14th most competitive financial center in the world, and fourth most competitive in the United States (after New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles).[164] Culture Main article: Culture of Washington, D.C. Landmarks See also: List of National Historic Landmarks in Washington, D.C. and National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington, D.C. The Lincoln Memorial receives about six million visits annually. The National Mall is a large, open park in downtown Washington between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol. Given its prominence, the mall is often the location of political protests, concerts, festivals, and presidential inaugurations. The Washington Monument and the Jefferson Pier are near the center of the mall, south of the White House. Also on the mall are the National World War II Memorial at the east end of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.[165] Directly south of the mall, the Tidal Basin features rows of Japanese cherry trees.[166] The Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, George Mason Memorial, Jefferson Memorial, Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, and the District of Columbia War Memorial are around the Tidal Basin.[165] The National Archives houses thousands of documents important to American history, including the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.[167] Located in three buildings on Capitol Hill, the Library of Congress is the largest library complex in the world with a collection of more than 147 million books, manuscripts, and other materials.[168] The United States Supreme Court Building was completed in 1935; before then, the court held sessions in the Old Senate Chamber of the Capitol.[169] Museums See also: List of museums in Washington, D.C. The Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest research and museum complex.[170] The Smithsonian Institution is an educational foundation chartered by Congress in 1846 that maintains most of the nation's official museums and galleries in Washington, D.C. The U.S. government partially funds the Smithsonian, and its collections are open to the public free of charge.[171] The Smithsonian's locations had a combined total of 30 million visits in 2013. The most visited museum is the National Museum of Natural History on the National Mall.[172] Other Smithsonian Institution museums and galleries on the mall are: the National Air and Space Museum; the National Museum of African Art; the National Museum of American History; the National Museum of the American Indian; the Sackler and Freer galleries, which both focus on Asian art and culture; the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden; the Arts and Industries Building; the S. Dillon Ripley Center; and the Smithsonian Institution Building (also known as ""The Castle""), which serves as the institution's headquarters.[173] The Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallery are housed in the Old Patent Office Building, near Washington's Chinatown.[174] The Renwick Gallery is officially part of the Smithsonian American Art Museum but is in a separate building near the White House. Other Smithsonian museums and galleries include: the Anacostia Community Museum in Southeast Washington; the National Postal Museum near Union Station; and the National Zoo in Woodley Park.[173] The National Gallery of Art The National Gallery of Art is on the National Mall near the Capitol and features American and European artworks. The U.S. government owns the gallery and its collections. However, they are not a part of the Smithsonian Institution.[175] The National Building Museum, which occupies the former Pension Building near Judiciary Square, was chartered by Congress and hosts exhibits on architecture, urban planning, and design.[176] There are many private art museums in the District of Columbia, which house major collections and exhibits open to the public, such as the National Museum of Women in the Arts and The Phillips Collection in Dupont Circle, the first museum of modern art in the United States.[177] Other private museums in Washington include the Newseum, the O Street Museum, the International Spy Museum, the National Geographic Society Museum, and the Museum of the Bible. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum near the National Mall maintains exhibits, documentation, and artifacts related to the Holocaust.[178] Arts Main articles: Theater in Washington, D.C. and Music of Washington, D.C.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is home to the National Symphony Orchestra, the Washington National Opera, and the Washington Ballet. The Kennedy Center Honors are awarded each year to those in the performing arts who have contributed greatly to the cultural life of the United States.[179] The historic Ford's Theatre, site of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, continues to operate as a functioning performance space as well as a museum.[180] The Marine Barracks near Capitol Hill houses the United States Marine Band; founded in 1798, it is the country's oldest professional musical organization.[181] American march composer and Washington-native John Philip Sousa led the Marine Band from 1880 until 1892.[182] Founded in 1925, the United States Navy Band has its headquarters at the Washington Navy Yard and performs at official events and public concerts around the city.[183] Washington has a strong local theater tradition. Founded in 1950, Arena Stage achieved national attention and spurred growth in the city's independent theater movement that now includes organizations such as the Shakespeare Theatre Company, Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company, and the Studio Theatre.[184] Arena Stage opened its newly renovated home in the city's emerging Southwest waterfront area in 2010.[185] The GALA Hispanic Theatre, now housed in the historic Tivoli Theatre in Columbia Heights, was founded in 1976 and is a National Center for the Latino Performing Arts.[186] The U Street Corridor in Northwest D.C., known as ""Washington's Black Broadway"", is home to institutions like the Howard Theatre, Bohemian Caverns, and the Lincoln Theatre, which hosted music legends such as Washington-native Duke Ellington, John Coltrane, and Miles Davis.[187] Washington has its own native music genre called go-go; a post-funk, percussion-driven flavor of rhythm and blues that was popularized in the late 1970s by D.C. band leader Chuck Brown.[188] The district is an important center for indie culture and music in the United States. The label Dischord Records, formed by Ian MacKaye, frontman of Fugazi, was one of the most crucial independent labels in the genesis of 1980s punk and eventually indie rock in the 1990s.[189] Modern alternative and indie music venues like The Black Cat and the 9:30 Club bring popular acts to the U Street area.[190] Sports Main article: Sports in Washington, D.C. Nationals Park is the home of the Washington Nationals. Washington is one of 13 cities in the United States with teams from all four major professional men's sports and is home to one major professional women's team. The Washington Wizards (National Basketball Association) and the Washington Capitals (National Hockey League) play at the Capital One Arena in Chinatown. The Washington Mystics (Women's National Basketball Association) play in the St. Elizabeths East Entertainment and Sports Arena. Nationals Park, which opened in Southeast D.C. in 2008, is home to the Washington Nationals (Major League Baseball). D.C. United (Major League Soccer) plays at Audi Field. The Washington Football Team (National Football League) plays at FedExField in nearby Landover, Maryland. D.C. teams have won a combined thirteen professional league championships: the Washington Football Team (then named the Washington Redskins) have won five (including three Super Bowls during the 1980s);[191] D.C. United has won four;[192] and the Washington Wizards (then the Washington Bullets), Washington Capitals, Washington Mystics and Washington Nationals have each won a single championship.[193][194] Other professional and semi-professional teams in Washington include: DC Defenders (XFL), Old Glory DC (Major League Rugby), the Washington Kastles (World TeamTennis); the Washington D.C. Slayers (USA Rugby League); the Baltimore Washington Eagles (U.S. Australian Football League); the D.C. Divas (Independent Women's Football League); and the Potomac Athletic Club RFC (Rugby Super League). The William H.G. FitzGerald Tennis Center in Rock Creek Park hosts the Citi Open. Washington is also home to two major annual marathon races: the Marine Corps Marathon, which is held every autumn, and the Rock 'n' Roll USA Marathon held in the spring. The Marine Corps Marathon began in 1976 and is sometimes called ""The People's Marathon"" because it is the largest marathon that does not offer prize money to participants.[195] The district's four NCAA Division I teams, American Eagles, George Washington Colonials, Georgetown Hoyas and Howard Bison and Lady Bison, have a broad following. The Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team is the most notable and also plays at the Capital One Arena. From 2008 to 2012, the district hosted an annual college football bowl game at RFK Stadium, called the Military Bowl.[196] The D.C. area is home to one regional sports television network, Comcast SportsNet (CSN), based in Bethesda, Maryland. Media Main article: Media in Washington, D.C. See also: List of newspapers in Washington, D.C.; List of films set in Washington, D.C.; and List of television shows set in Washington, D.C. One Franklin Square: The Washington Post Building on Franklin Square Washington, D.C., is a prominent center for national and international media. The Washington Post, founded in 1877, is the oldest and most-read local daily newspaper in Washington.[197] ""The Post"", as it is popularly called, is well known as the newspaper that exposed the Watergate scandal.[198] It had the sixth-highest readership of all news dailies in the country in 2011.[199] From 2003 to 2019, The Washington Post Company published a daily free commuter newspaper called the Express, which summarized events, sports and entertainment;[200] it still publishes the Spanish-language paper El Tiempo Latino. Another popular local daily is The Washington Times, the city's second general interest broadsheet and also an influential paper in conservative political circles.[201] The alternative weekly Washington City Paper also has a substantial readership in the Washington area.[202][203] The Watergate complex was the site of the Watergate Scandal, which led to President Nixon's resignation. Some community and specialty papers focus on neighborhood and cultural issues, including the weekly Washington Blade and Metro Weekly, which focus on LGBT issues; the Washington Informer and The Washington Afro American, which highlight topics of interest to the black community; and neighborhood newspapers published by The Current Newspapers. Congressional Quarterly, The Hill, Politico and Roll Call newspapers focus exclusively on issues related to Congress and the federal government. Other publications based in Washington include the National Geographic magazine and political publications such as The Washington Examiner, The New Republic and Washington Monthly.[204] The Washington Metropolitan Area is the ninth-largest television media market in the nation, with two million homes, approximately 2% of the country's population.[205] Several media companies and cable television channels have their headquarters in the area, including C-SPAN; Black Entertainment Television (BET); Radio One; the National Geographic Channel; Smithsonian Networks; National Public Radio (NPR); Travel Channel (in Chevy Chase, Maryland); Discovery Communications (in Silver Spring, Maryland); and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) (in Arlington, Virginia). The headquarters of Voice of America, the U.S. government's international news service, is near the Capitol in Southwest Washington.[206] Washington has two local NPR affiliates, WAMU and WETA. Government and politics Main article: Government of the District of Columbia Politics See also: District of Columbia home rule; List of mayors of Washington, D.C.; List of District of Columbia symbols; and United States presidential elections in Washington, D.C. Article One, Section Eight of the United States Constitution grants the United States Congress ""exclusive jurisdiction"" over the city. The district did not have an elected local government until the passage of the 1973 Home Rule Act. The Act devolved certain Congressional powers to an elected mayor and the thirteen-member Council of the District of Columbia. However, Congress retains the right to review and overturn laws created by the council and intervene in local affairs.[207] Each of the city's eight wards elects a single member of the council and residents elect four at-large members to represent the district as a whole. The council chair is also elected at-large.[208] There are 37 Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs) elected by small neighborhood districts. ANCs can issue recommendations on all issues that affect residents; government agencies take their advice under careful consideration.[209] The attorney general of the District of Columbia is elected to a four-year term.[210] Washington, D.C., observes all federal holidays and also celebrates Emancipation Day on April 16, which commemorates the end of slavery in the district.[40] The flag of Washington, D.C., was adopted in 1938 and is a variation on George Washington's family coat of arms.[211] Washington, D.C., is overwhelmingly Democratic, having voted for the Democratic candidate solidly since it was granted electoral votes in 1964. Each Republican candidate was voted down in favor of the Democratic candidate by a margin of at least 56 percentage points each time; the closest, albeit very large, margin between the two parties in a presidential election was in 1972, when Richard Nixon secured 21.56% of the vote to George McGovern's 78.10%. Since then, the Republican candidate has never received more than 20 percent of the vote. Every Democrat since 2008 has received over 90% of the vote. Additionally, since 2016, the city's residential voting population has become almost unanimously Democratic, more so than it has ever been. Since 2016, no Democrat has received less than 93% of the major-party vote in the federal district, a level of support that has not been crossed districtwide before that election. Same-sex marriage has been legal in the district since 2010, and conversion therapy has been prohibited since 2015. Assisted suicide is also permitted in the district, with a bill legalizing the practice being introduced in 2015, signed by mayor Muriel Bowser in 2016, and going into effect in 2017, making Washington, D.C., the seventh jurisdiction in the United States to have legalized assisted suicide, along with Washington, Oregon, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Montana and Vermont. Washington, D.C., has been a member state of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) since 2015. The idiom Inside the Beltway is an occasional reference used by media to describe political issues inside of Washington, D.C., by way of geographical demarcation regarding the region inner to the Capital's Beltway, Interstate 495, the city's highway loop (beltway) constructed in 1964. Budgetary issues The John A. Wilson Building houses the offices of the mayor of Washington and the Council of the District of Columbia. The mayor and council set local taxes and a budget, which Congress must approve. The Government Accountability Office and other analysts have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the Congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the district's local budget of anywhere between $470 million and over $1 billion per year. Congress typically provides additional grants for federal programs such as Medicaid and the operation of the local justice system; however, analysts claim that the payments do not fully resolve the imbalance.[212][213] The city's local government, particularly during the mayoralty of Marion Barry, was criticized for mismanagement and waste.[214] During his administration in 1989, The Washington Monthly magazine claimed that the district had ""the worst city government in America"".[215] In 1995, at the start of Barry's fourth term, Congress created the District of Columbia Financial Control Board to oversee all municipal spending.[216] Mayor Anthony Williams won election in 1998 and oversaw a period of urban renewal and budget surpluses. The district regained control over its finances in 2001 and the oversight board's operations were suspended.[217] The district has a federally funded ""Emergency Planning and Security Fund"" to cover security related to visits by foreign leaders and diplomats, presidential inaugurations, protests, and terrorism concerns. During the Trump administration, the fund has run with a deficit. Trump's January 2017 inauguration cost the city $27 million; of that, $7 million was never repaid to the fund. Trump's 2019 Independence Day event, ""A Salute to America"", cost six times more than Independence Day events in past years.[218] Voting rights debate See also: District of Columbia voting rights and Political party strength in Washington, D.C. The Eisenhower Executive Office Building, once the world's largest office building, houses the Executive Office of the President of the United States. The district is not a state and therefore has no voting representation in Congress. D.C. residents elect a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives (D.C. At-Large), who may sit on committees, participate in debate, and introduce legislation, but cannot vote on the House floor. The district has no official representation in the United States Senate. Neither chamber seats the district's elected ""shadow"" representative or senators. Unlike residents of U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico or Guam, which also have non-voting delegates, D.C. residents are subject to all federal taxes.[219] In the financial year 2012, D.C. residents and businesses paid $20.7 billion in federal taxes; more than the taxes collected from 19 states and the highest federal taxes per capita.[220] A 2005 poll found that 78% of Americans did not know residents of the District of Columbia have less representation in Congress than residents of the fifty states.[221] Efforts to raise awareness about the issue have included campaigns by grassroots organizations and featuring the city's unofficial motto, ""Taxation Without Representation"", on D.C. vehicle license plates.[222] There is evidence of nationwide approval for D.C. voting rights; various polls indicate that 61 to 82% of Americans believe D.C. should have voting representation in Congress.[221][223] Several approaches to resolving these concerns been suggested over the years: District of Columbia Statehood: Almost all the District of Columbia would become the 51st State as Washington, Douglass Commonwealth. The much-reduced District of Columbia would run from Capitol Hill west to the Potomac, including the White House and many federal buildings; no one resides permanently in this federal enclave. District of Columbia Retrocession to Maryland: As Arlington County in 1846 was retroceded to Virginia, proponents believe the rest of the District of Columbia except for a small strip of land around the Capitol and the White House (the federal enclave) would be given back to Maryland, allowing for DC residents to become Maryland residents as they were before the Residence Act of 1790. District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment: this option would allow DC residents to vote in Maryland or Virginia for their congressional representatives, with the District of Columbia remaining an independent entity. This was in effect from 1790 to 1801, before the Organic Act of 1801. Opponents of D.C. voting rights propose that the Founding Fathers never intended for district residents to have a vote in Congress since the Constitution makes clear that representation must come from the states. Those opposed to making D.C. a state claim such a move would destroy the notion of a separate national capital and that statehood would unfairly grant Senate representation to a single city.[224] Sister cities Washington, D.C., has fifteen official sister city agreements. Each of the listed cities is a national capital except for Sunderland, which includes the town of Washington, the ancestral home of George Washington's family.[225] Paris and Rome are each formally recognized as a partner city due to their special one sister city policy.[226] Listed in the order each agreement was first established, they are: Bangkok, Thailand (1962, renewed 2002 and 2012) Dakar, Senegal (1980, renewed 2006) Beijing, China (1984, renewed 2004 and 2012) Brussels, Belgium (1985, renewed 2002 and 2011) Athens, Greece (2000) Paris, France (2000 as a friendship and cooperation agreement, renewed 2005)[226][227] Pretoria, South Africa (2002, renewed 2008 and 2011) Seoul, South Korea (2006) Accra, Ghana (2006) Sunderland, United Kingdom (2006, renewed 2012)[225] Rome, Italy (2011, renewed 2013)[226] Ankara, Turkey (2011) Brasília, Brazil (2013) Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2013)[228] San Salvador, El Salvador (2018) Education See also: List of parochial and private schools in Washington, D.C. The Library of Congress is one of the world's largest libraries, with more than 167 million cataloged items.[229] District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) operates the city's 123 public schools.[230] The number of students in DCPS steadily decreased for 39 years until 2009. In the 2010–11 school year, 46,191 students were enrolled in the public school system.[231] DCPS has one of the highest-cost, yet lowest-performing school systems in the country, in terms of both infrastructure and student achievement.[232] Mayor Adrian Fenty's administration made sweeping changes to the system by closing schools, replacing teachers, firing principals, and using private education firms to aid curriculum development.[233] The District of Columbia Public Charter School Board monitors the 52 public charter schools in the city.[234] Due to the perceived problems with the traditional public school system, enrollment in public charter schools had by 2007 steadily increased.[235] As of 2010, D.C., charter schools had a total enrollment of about 32,000, a 9% increase from the prior year.[231] The district is also home to 92 private schools, which enrolled approximately 18,000 students in 2008.[236] The District of Columbia Public Library operates 25 neighborhood locations including the landmark Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library.[237] Higher education See also: List of colleges and universities in Washington, D.C. Georgetown Day at Georgetown University Private universities include American University (AU), the Catholic University of America (CUA), Gallaudet University, George Washington University (GW), Georgetown University (GU), Howard University (HU), the Johns Hopkins University Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), and Trinity Washington University. The Corcoran College of Art and Design, the oldest art school in the capital, was absorbed into the George Washington University in 2014, now serving as its college of arts. The University of the District of Columbia (UDC) is a public land-grant university providing undergraduate and graduate education. D.C. residents may also be eligible for a grant of up to $10,000 per year to offset the cost of tuition at any public university in the country.[238] The district is known for its medical research institutions such as Washington Hospital Center and the Children's National Medical Center, as well as the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. In addition, the city is home to three medical schools and associated teaching hospitals at George Washington, Georgetown, and Howard universities.[239] Infrastructure Transportation Main article: Transportation in Washington, D.C. A Blue Line train at Farragut West, an underground station on the Washington Metro There are 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of streets, parkways, and avenues in the district.[240] Due to the freeway revolts of the 1960s, much of the proposed interstate highway system through the middle of Washington was never built. Interstate 95 (I-95), the nation's major east coast highway, therefore bends around the district to form the eastern portion of the Capital Beltway. A portion of the proposed highway funding was directed to the region's public transportation infrastructure instead.[241] The interstate highways that continue into Washington, including I-66 and I-395, both terminate shortly after entering the city.[242] The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) operates the Washington Metro, the city's rapid transit system, as well as Metrobus. Both systems serve the district and its suburbs. Metro opened on March 27, 1976 and, as of 2014[update], consists of 91 stations and 117 miles (188 km) of track.[243] With an average of about one million trips each weekday, Metro is the second-busiest rapid transit system in the country. Metrobus serves more than 400,000 riders each weekday and is the nation's fifth-largest bus system.[244] The city also operates its own DC Circulator bus system, which connects commercial areas within central Washington.[245] Washington Union Station is one of the busiest rail stations in the United States. Union Station is the city's main train station and services approximately 70,000 people each day. It is Amtrak's second-busiest station with 4.6 million passengers annually and is the southern terminus for the Northeast Corridor and Acela Express routes. Maryland's MARC and Virginia's VRE commuter trains and the Metrorail Red Line also provide service into Union Station.[246] Following renovations in 2011, Union Station became Washington's primary intercity bus transit center.[247] Three major airports serve the district. The closest is Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which is about 5 miles from the city and is primarily reserved for domestic flights, but is the least busy in the region. The busiest by international flights is Washington Dulles International Airport located about 24 miles away from the city center,[248] and the busiest by total passenger boardings is Baltimore/Washington International Airport, about 30 miles from the city. Each of these three airports also serves as a hub for a major American airline: Reagan is a small hub for American Airlines, Dulles is a major hub for United Airlines and Star Alliance partners, and BWI is a major focus city for Southwest Airlines. I-66 in Washington, D.C. According to a 2010 study, Washington-area commuters spent 70 hours a year in traffic delays, which tied with Chicago for having the nation's worst road congestion.[249] However, 37% of Washington-area commuters take public transportation to work, the second-highest rate in the country.[250] An additional 12% of D.C. commuters walked to work, 6% carpooled, and 3% traveled by bicycle in 2010.[251] A 2011 study by Walk Score found that Washington was the seventh-most walkable city in the country with 80% of residents living in neighborhoods that are not car dependent.[252] In 2013, the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria metropolitan statistical area (MSA) had the eighth lowest percentage of workers who commuted by private automobile (75.7 percent), with 8 percent of area workers traveling via rail transit.[253] An expected 32% increase in transit usage within the district by 2030 has spurred the construction of a new DC Streetcar system to interconnect the city's neighborhoods.[254] An additional Metro line that will connect Washington to Dulles airport is expected to open by July 2021 at the earliest.[needs update][255][256] The district is part of the regional Capital Bikeshare program. Started in 2010, it is one of the largest bicycle sharing systems in the country with more than 4,351 bicycles and more than 395 stations,[257] all provided by PBSC Urban Solutions. By 2012, the city's network of marked bicycle lanes covered 56 miles (90 km) of streets.[258] Utilities The Capitol Power Plant, built to supply energy for the U.S. Capitol Complex, is under the jurisdiction of the Architect of the Capitol. The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (i.e., WASA or D.C. Water) is an independent authority of the D.C. government that provides drinking water and wastewater collection in Washington. WASA purchases water from the historic Washington Aqueduct, which is operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. The water, sourced from the Potomac River, is treated and stored in the city's Dalecarlia, Georgetown, and McMillan reservoirs. The aqueduct provides drinking water for a total of 1.1 million people in the district and Virginia, including Arlington, Falls Church, and a portion of Fairfax County.[259] The authority also provides sewage treatment services for an additional 1.6 million people in four surrounding Maryland and Virginia counties.[260] Pepco is the city's electric utility and services 793,000 customers in the district and suburban Maryland.[261] An 1889 law prohibits overhead wires within much of the historic City of Washington. As a result, all power lines and telecommunication cables are located underground in downtown Washington, and traffic signals are placed at the edge of the street.[262] A plan announced in 2013 would bury an additional 60 miles (97 km) of primary power lines throughout the district.[263] Washington Gas is the city's natural gas utility and serves more than a million customers in the district and its suburbs. Incorporated by Congress in 1848, the company installed the city's first gas lights in the Capitol, the White House, and along Pennsylvania Avenue.[264] See also United States portal Index of Washington, D.C.–related articles Outline of Washington, D.C. List of people from Washington, D.C. Notes ^ By 1790, the Southern states had largely repaid their overseas debts from the Revolutionary War. The Northern states had not, and wanted the federal government to take over their outstanding liabilities. Southern Congressmen agreed to the plan in return for establishing the new national capital at their preferred site on the Potomac River.[22] ^ The Residence Act allowed the President to select a location within Maryland as far east as the Anacostia River. However, Washington shifted the federal territory's borders to the southeast to include the city of Alexandria at the District's southern tip. In 1791, Congress amended the Residence Act to approve the new site, including territory ceded by Virginia.[23] ^ Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the expected highest and lowest temperature readings at any point during the year or given month) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020. ^ Official records for Washington, D.C. were kept at 24th and M Streets NW from January 1871 to June 1945, and at Reagan National Airport since July 1945.[89] ^ Apportionment totals are collected by combining Resident and Overseas population. (For D.C., this is 689545 residents and 1988 overseas population. ^ Until 1890, the Census Bureau counted the City of Washington, Georgetown, and unincorporated portions of Washington County as three separate areas.

It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major unincorporated territories, 326 Indian reservations, and some minor possessions.[i] At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million square kilometers), it is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area.[c] The United States shares significant land borders with Canada to the north and Mexico to the south, as well as limited maritime borders with Cuba, Russia, and the Bahamas.[22] With a population of more than 331 million people, it is the third most populous country in the world. The national capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city is New York City. Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago, and European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast. Disputes over taxation and political representation with Great Britain led to the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), which established independence. In the late 18th century, the U.S. began expanding across North America, gradually obtaining new territories, sometimes through war, frequently displacing Native Americans, and admitting new states; by 1848, the United States spanned the continent. Slavery was legal in the southern United States until the second half of the 19th century when the American Civil War led to its abolition. The Spanish–American War and World War I established the U.S. as a world power, a status confirmed by the outcome of World War II. During the Cold War, the United States fought the Korean War and the Vietnam War but avoided direct military conflict with the Soviet Union. The two superpowers competed in the Space Race, culminating in the 1969 spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. The Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991 ended the Cold War, leaving the United States as the world's sole superpower. The United States is a federal republic and a representative democracy with three separate branches of government, including a bicameral legislature. It is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States, NATO, and other international organizations. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Considered a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, its population has been profoundly shaped by centuries of immigration. The U.S. ranks high in international measures of economic freedom, quality of life, education, and human rights, and has low levels of perceived corruption. However, the country has received criticism concerning inequality related to race, wealth and income, the use of capital punishment, high incarceration rates, and lack of universal health care. The United States is a highly developed country, accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP, and is the world's largest economy by GDP at market exchange rates. By value, the United States is the world's largest importer and the second-largest exporter of goods. Although its population is only 4.2% of the world's total, it holds 29.4% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share held by any country. Making up more than a third of global military spending, it is the foremost military power in the world; and it is a leading political, cultural, and scientific force internationally.[23] Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2.1 Indigenous peoples and pre-Columbian history 2.2 European settlements 2.3 Independence and expansion 2.4 Civil War and Reconstruction era 2.5 Further immigration, expansion, and industrialization 2.6 World War I, Great Depression, and World War II 2.7 Cold War and civil rights era 2.8 Contemporary history 3 Geography 3.1 Wildlife and conservation 4 Demographics 4.1 Population 4.2 Language 4.3 Religion 4.4 Health 4.5 Education 5 Government and politics 5.1 Political divisions 5.2 Parties and elections 5.3 Foreign relations 5.4 Government finance 5.5 Military 5.6 Law enforcement and crime 6 Economy 6.1 Science and technology 6.2 Income, wealth, and poverty 7 Infrastructure 7.1 Transportation 7.2 Energy 8 Culture 8.1 Literature, philosophy, and visual art 8.2 Food 8.3 Music 8.4 Cinema 8.5 Sports 8.6 Mass media 9 See also 10 Notes 11 References 12 Further reading 13 External links Etymology See also: Naming of the Americas, Names of the United States, Names for United States citizens, and American (word) The first known use of the name ""America"" dates back to 1507, when it appeared on a world map produced by the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller. On his map, the name is shown in large letters on what would now be considered South America, in honor of Amerigo Vespucci. The Italian explorer was the first to postulate that the West Indies did not represent Asia's eastern limit but were part of a previously unknown landmass.[24][25] In 1538, the Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator used the name ""America"" on his own world map, applying it to the entire Western Hemisphere.[26] The first documentary evidence of the phrase ""United States of America"" dates from a January 2, 1776 letter written by Stephen Moylan to George Washington's aide-de-camp Joseph Reed. Moylan expressed his wish to go ""with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain"" to seek assistance in the revolutionary war effort.[27][28][29] The first known publication of the phrase ""United States of America"" was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776.[30] The second draft of the Articles of Confederation, prepared by John Dickinson and completed no later than June 17, 1776, declared ""The name of this Confederation shall be the 'United States of America'.""[31] The final version of the Articles, sent to the states for ratification in late 1777, stated that ""The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'.""[32] In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase ""UNITED STATES OF AMERICA"" in all capitalized letters in the headline of his ""original Rough draught"" of the Declaration of Independence.[31] This draft of the document did not surface until June 21, 1776, and it is unclear whether it was written before or after Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles of Confederation.[31] The short form ""United States"" is also standard. Other common forms are the ""U.S."", the ""USA"", and ""America"". Colloquial names are the ""U.S. of A."" and, internationally, the ""States"". ""Columbia"", a name popular in American poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus; both ""Columbus"" and ""Columbia"" appear frequently in U.S. place-names, including Columbus, Ohio, Columbia, South Carolina, and the District of Columbia. Places and institutions throughout the Western Hemisphere bear the two names, including Colón, Panama, the country of Colombia, the Columbia River, and Columbia University. The phrase ""United States"" was originally plural in American usage. It described a collection of states—e.g., ""the United States are."" The singular form became popular after the end of the Civil War and is now standard usage in the U.S. A citizen of the United States is an ""American"". ""United States"", ""American"" and ""U.S."" refer to the country adjectivally (""American values"", ""U.S. forces""). In English, the word ""American"" rarely refers to topics or subjects not directly connected with the United States.[33] History Main articles: History of the United States and Outline of United States history Indigenous peoples and pre-Columbian history Further information: Native Americans in the United States, Prehistory of the United States, and Pre-Columbian era The Cliff Palace, built by the Native American Puebloans between AD 1190 and 1260 It has been generally accepted that the first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 12,000 years ago; however, some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival.[34][35][36] The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to represent the first wave of human settlement of the Americas.[37][38] This was likely the first of three major waves of migration into North America; later waves brought the ancestors of present-day Athabaskans, Aleuts, and Eskimos.[39] Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[40] The city-state of Cahokia is the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in the modern-day United States.[41] In the Four Corners region, Ancestral Puebloan culture developed from centuries of agricultural experimentation.[42] The Haudenosaunee, located in the southern Great Lakes region, was established at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries.[43] Most prominent along the Atlantic coast were the Algonquian tribes, who practiced hunting and trapping, along with limited cultivation. Estimating the native population of North America at the time of European contact is difficult.[44][45] Douglas H. Ubelaker of the Smithsonian Institution estimated that there was a population of 92,916 in the south Atlantic states and a population of 473,616 in the Gulf states,[46] but most academics regard this figure as too low.[44] Anthropologist Henry F. Dobyns believed the populations were much higher, suggesting around 1.1 million along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, 2.2 million people living between Florida and Massachusetts, 5.2 million in the Mississippi Valley and tributaries, and around 700,000 people in the Florida peninsula.[44][45] European settlements Further information: Colonial history of the United States and Thirteen Colonies Claims of very early colonization of coastal New England by the Norse are disputed and controversial. The first documented arrival of Europeans in the continental United States is that of Spanish conquistadors such as Juan Ponce de León, who made his first expedition to Florida in 1513. Even earlier, Christopher Columbus had landed in Puerto Rico on his 1493 voyage, and San Juan was settled by the Spanish a decade later.[47] The Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, such as Saint Augustine, often considered the nation's oldest city,[48] and Santa Fe. The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River, notably New Orleans.[49] Successful English settlement of the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and with the Pilgrims' colony at Plymouth in 1620.[50][51] The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses, was founded in 1619. Documents such as the Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[52][53] Many settlers were dissenting Christians who came seeking religious freedom. In 1784, the Russians were the first Europeans to establish a settlement in Alaska, at Three Saints Bay. Russian America once spanned much of the present-day state of Alaska.[54] In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and European settlers. In many cases, however, the natives and settlers came to depend on one another. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts; natives for guns, tools and other European goods.[55] Natives taught many settlers to cultivate corn, beans, and other foodstuffs. European missionaries and others felt it was important to ""civilize"" the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural practices and lifestyles.[56][57] However, with the increased European colonization of North America, the Native Americans were displaced and often killed.[58] The native population of America declined after European arrival for various reasons,[59][60][61] primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles.[62][63] The original Thirteen Colonies (shown in red) in 1775 European settlers also began trafficking of African slaves into Colonial America via the transatlantic slave trade.[64] Because of a lower prevalence of tropical diseases and better treatment, slaves had a much higher life expectancy in North America than in South America, leading to a rapid increase in their numbers.[65][66] Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery, and several colonies passed acts both against and in favor of the practice.[67][68] However, by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves had supplanted European indentured servants as cash crop labor, especially in the American South.[69] The Thirteen Colonies (New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia) that would become the United States of America were administered by the British as overseas dependencies.[70] All nonetheless had local governments with elections open to most free men.[71] With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations.[72] The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest both in religion and in religious liberty.[73] During the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), known in the U.S. as the French and Indian War, British forces captured Canada from the French. With the creation of the Province of Quebec, Canada's francophone population would remain isolated from the English-speaking colonial dependencies of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and the Thirteen Colonies. Excluding the Native Americans who lived there, the Thirteen Colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about a third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[74] The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their unprecedented success motivated British monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority.[75] Independence and expansion Further information: American Revolution and Territorial evolution of the United States Declaration of Independence, painting by John Trumbull, depicts the Committee of Five presenting their draft of the Declaration to the Continental Congress, July 4, 1776 The American Revolutionary War fought by the Thirteen Colonies against the British Empire was the first successful war of independence by a non-European entity against a European power in modern history. Americans had developed an ideology of ""republicanism"", asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded their ""rights as Englishmen"" and ""no taxation without representation"". The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into war.[76] The Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776; this day is celebrated annually as Independence Day.[77] In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[77] After its defeat at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty. American sovereignty became internationally recognized, and the country was granted all lands east of the Mississippi River. Tensions with Britain remained, however, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a draw.[78] Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches in 1789, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. George Washington, who had led the Continental Army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.[79] Territorial acquisitions of the United States between 1783 and 1917 Although the federal government outlawed American participation in the Atlantic slave trade in 1807, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it, the slave population.[80][81][82] The Second Great Awakening, especially in the period 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism;[83] in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.[84] Beginning in the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward,[85] prompting a long series of American Indian Wars.[86] The 1803 Louisiana Purchase almost doubled the nation's area,[87] Spain ceded Florida and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819,[88] the Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845 during a period of expansionism,[89] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[90] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest, making the U.S. span the continent.[85][91] The California Gold Rush of 1848–1849 spurred migration to the Pacific coast, which led to the California Genocide[92] and the creation of additional western states.[93] The giving away of vast quantities of land to white European settlers as part of the Homestead Acts, nearly 10% of the total area of the United States, and to private railroad companies and colleges as part of land grants spurred economic development.[94] After the Civil War, new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[95] In 1869, a new Peace Policy nominally promised to protect Native Americans from abuses, avoid further war, and secure their eventual U.S. citizenship. Nonetheless, large-scale conflicts continued throughout the West into the 1900s. Civil War and Reconstruction era Main articles: American Civil War and Reconstruction era The Battle of Gettysburg, fought between Union and Confederate forces on July 1–3, 1863, around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, marked a turning point in the American Civil War. Irreconcilable sectional conflict regarding the enslavement of Africans and African Americans ultimately led to the American Civil War.[96] With the 1860 election of Republican Abraham Lincoln, conventions in thirteen slave states declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America (the ""South"" or the ""Confederacy""), while the federal government (the ""Union"") maintained that secession was illegal.[97] In order to bring about this secession, military action was initiated by the secessionists, and the Union responded in kind. The ensuing war would become the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians.[98] The Union initially simply fought to keep the country united. Nevertheless, as casualties mounted after 1863 and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation, the main purpose of the war from the Union's viewpoint became the abolition of slavery. Indeed, when the Union ultimately won the war in April 1865, each of the states in the defeated South was required to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment, which prohibited slavery except as penal labor. Two other amendments were also ratified, ensuring citizenship for blacks and, at least in theory, voting rights for them as well. Reconstruction began in earnest following the war. While President Lincoln attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the Union and the former Confederacy, his assassination on April 14, 1865 drove a wedge between North and South again. Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans. They persisted until the Compromise of 1877 when the Republicans agreed to cease protecting the rights of African Americans in the South in order for Democrats to concede the presidential election of 1876. Southern white Democrats, calling themselves ""Redeemers"", took control of the South after the end of Reconstruction, beginning the nadir of American race relations. From 1890 to 1910, the Redeemers established so-called Jim Crow laws, disenfranchising most blacks and some poor whites throughout the region. Blacks would face racial segregation nationwide, especially in the South.[99] They also occasionally experienced vigilante violence, including lynching.[100] Further immigration, expansion, and industrialization Main articles: Economic history of the United States and Technological and industrial history of the United States Ellis Island, in New York Harbor, was a major entry point for European immigration into the U.S.[101] In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture.[102] National infrastructure, including telegraph and transcontinental railroads, spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West. The later invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life.[103] The United States fought Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River from 1810 to at least 1890.[104] Most of these conflicts ended with the cession of Native American territory and their confinement to Indian reservations. Additionally, the Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that forcibly resettled Indians. This further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets.[105] Mainland expansion also included the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.[106] In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii, which the U.S. annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the Spanish–American War.[107] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the end of the Second Samoan Civil War.[108] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[109] Rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation's progress in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. The American economy boomed, becoming the world's largest.[110] These dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[111] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms including women's suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, and greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.[112][113][114] World War I, Great Depression, and World War II Further information: World War I, Great Depression, and World War II The Empire State Building was the tallest building in the world when completed in 1931, during the Great Depression. The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I in 1914 until 1917 when it joined the war as an ""associated power"" alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers. In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations. However, the Senate refused to approve this and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations.[115] In 1920, the women's rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage.[116] The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television.[117] The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression. After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal.[118] The Great Migration of millions of African Americans out of the American South began before World War I and extended through the 1960s;[119] whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.[120] U.S. Marines raising the American flag on Mount Suribachi during the Battle of Iwo Jima in one of the most iconic images of the war. At first effectively neutral during World War II, the United States began supplying materiel to the Allies in March 1941 through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, prompting the United States to join the Allies against the Axis powers, and in the following year, to intern about 120,000[121] U.S. residents (including American citizens) of Japanese descent.[122] Although Japan attacked the United States first, the U.S. nonetheless pursued a ""Europe first"" defense policy.[123] The United States thus left its vast Asian colony, the Philippines, isolated and fighting a losing struggle against Japanese invasion and occupation. During the war, the United States was one of the ""Four Powers""[124] who met to plan the postwar world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union, and China.[125][126] Although the nation lost around 400,000 military personnel,[127] it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence.[128] The United States played a leading role in the Bretton Woods and Yalta conferences, which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and Europe's postwar reorganization. As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war.[129] The United States and Japan then fought each other in the largest naval battle in history, the Battle of Leyte Gulf.[130][131] The United States developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945; the Japanese surrendered on September 2, ending World War II.[132][133] Cold War and civil rights era Main articles: History of the United States (1945–1964), History of the United States (1964–1980), and History of the United States (1980–1991) Further information: Cold War, Civil Rights Movement, War on Poverty, Space Race, and Reaganomics Martin Luther King Jr. gives his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington, 1963 U.S. president Ronald Reagan (left) and Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva, 1985 After World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union competed for power, influence, and prestige during what became known as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism.[134] They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.[135] The United States often opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored and occasionally pursued direct action for regime change against left-wing governments, occasionally supporting authoritarian right-wing regimes.[136] American troops fought communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the Korean War of 1950–1953.[137] The Soviet Union's 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first crewed spaceflight initiated a ""Space Race"" in which the United States became the first nation to land a man on the Moon in 1969.[137] The United States became increasingly involved in the Vietnam War (1955–1975), introducing combat forces in 1965.[138] At home, the U.S. had experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth of its population and middle class following World War II. After a surge in female labor participation, especially in the 1970s, by 1985, the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[139] Construction of an Interstate Highway System transformed the nation's infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments.[140][141] In 1959, the United States formally expanded beyond the contiguous United States when the territories of Alaska and Hawaii became, respectively, the 49th and 50th states admitted into the Union.[142] The growing Civil Rights Movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead.[143] A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, sought to end racial discrimination.[144][145][146] Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew, which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, the Black Power movement, and the sexual revolution.[147] The launch of a ""War on Poverty"" expanded entitlements and welfare spending, including the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, two programs that provide health coverage to the elderly and poor, respectively, and the means-tested Food Stamp Program and Aid to Families with Dependent Children.[148] The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation. The United States supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War; in response, the country faced an oil embargo from OPEC nations, sparking the 1973 oil crisis. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter brokered a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, marking the first time an Arab nation recognized Israeli existence.[relevant?] After his election, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms. Following the collapse of détente, he abandoned ""containment"" and initiated the more aggressive ""rollback"" strategy towards the Soviet Union.[149][150] The late 1980s brought a ""thaw"" in relations with the Soviet Union, and its collapse in 1991 finally ended the Cold War.[151][152][153] This brought about unipolarity[154] with the U.S. unchallenged as the world's dominant superpower.[155] Contemporary history Main articles: History of the United States (1991–2008) and History of the United States (2008–present) The World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan during the September 11 terrorist attacks by the Islamic terrorist group Al-Qaeda in 2001 After the Cold War, the conflict in the Middle East triggered a crisis in 1990, when Iraq invaded and annexed Kuwait, an ally of the United States. Fearing the spread of instability, in August, President George H. W. Bush launched and led the Gulf War against Iraq; waged until January 1991 by coalition forces from 34 nations, it ended in the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and restoration of the monarchy.[156] Originating within U.S. military defense networks, the Internet spread to international academic platforms and then to the public in the 1990s, greatly affecting the global economy, society, and culture.[157] Due to the dot-com boom, stable monetary policy, and reduced social welfare spending, the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history.[158] Beginning in 1994, the U.S. signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), causing trade among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to soar.[159] On September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda terrorist hijackers flew passenger planes into the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people.[160] In response, President George W. Bush launched the War on Terror, which included a war in Afghanistan and the 2003–2011 Iraq War.[161][162] A 2011 military operation in Pakistan led to the death of the leader of Al-Qaeda.[163] Government policy designed to promote affordable housing,[164] widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance,[165] and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve[166] led to the mid-2000s housing bubble, which culminated with the 2008 financial crisis, the nation's largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.[167] During the crisis, assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value.[168] Barack Obama, the first multiracial[169] president, with African-American ancestry[170] was elected in 2008 amid the crisis,[171] and subsequently passed stimulus measures and the Dodd–Frank Act in an attempt to mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be a repeat of the crisis. In 2010, President Obama led efforts to pass the Affordable Care Act, the most sweeping reform to the nation's healthcare system in nearly five decades.[172] In the presidential election of 2016, Republican Donald Trump was elected as the 45th president of the United States, a result viewed as one of the biggest political upsets since the 1948 election.[173] In the presidential election of 2020, Democrat Joe Biden was elected as the 46th president.[174] On January 6, 2021, supporters of outgoing President Trump stormed the United States Capitol in an unsuccessful effort to disrupt the presidential Electoral College vote count.[175] Geography Main article: Geography of the United States Köppen climate classifications of U.S. states and territories The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470 km2). Of this area, 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,940 km2) is contiguous land, composing 83.65% of total U.S. land area.[176][177] Hawaii, occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific, southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles (28,311 km2) in area. The five populated but unincorporated territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and U.S. Virgin Islands together cover 9,185 square miles (23,789 km2).[178] Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.[179] The United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest nation by total area (land and water), ranking behind Russia and Canada and nearly equal to China. The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted, and how the total size of the United States is measured.[c][180][181] The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of the Piedmont.[182] The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[183] The Mississippi–Missouri River, the world's fourth longest river system, runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[183] The Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking around 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[184] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua and Mojave.[185] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast, both ranges reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet (4,300 m). The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[186] and only about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[187] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and in North America.[188] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[189] The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[190] The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[191] States bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.[192] Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country in the world.[193] Wildlife and conservation Main articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States The bald eagle has been the national bird of the United States since 1782.[194] The U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing a large amount of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and more than 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[195] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 bird species, 311 reptile species, and 295 amphibian species,[196] as well as about 91,000 insect species.[197] There are 62 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas.[198] Altogether, the government owns about 28% of the country's land area,[199] mostly in the western states.[200] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching, and about .86% is used for military purposes.[201][202] Environmental issues include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation,[203][204] and climate change.[205][206] The most prominent environmental agency is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970.[207] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[208] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.[209] The United States is ranked 24th among nations in the Environmental Performance Index.[210] The country joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016 and has many other environmental commitments.[211] It left the Paris Agreement in 2020,[212] and rejoined it in 2021.[213] Demographics Main articles: Americans, Demographics of the United States, Race and ethnicity in the United States, and Family structure in the United States Population See also: List of U.S. states by population and List of United States cities by population Historical population Census Pop. %± 17903,929,214—18005,308,48335.1%18107,239,88136.4%18209,638,45333.1%183012,866,02033.5%184017,069,45332.7%185023,191,87635.9%186031,443,32135.6%187038,558,37122.6%188050,189,20930.2%189062,979,76625.5%190076,212,16821.0%191092,228,49621.0%1920106,021,53715.0%1930123,202,62416.2%1940132,164,5697.3%1950151,325,79814.5%1960179,323,17518.5%1970203,211,92613.3%1980226,545,80511.5%1990248,709,8739.8%2000281,421,90613.2%2010308,745,5389.7%2020331,449,2817.4%Note that the census numbers donot include Native Americans until 1860.[214] The U.S. Census Bureau reported 331,449,281 residents as of April 1, 2020.[215] This figure, like most official data for the United States as a whole, excludes the five unincorporated territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands) and minor island possessions. According to the Bureau's U.S. Population Clock, on January 28, 2021, the U.S. population had a net gain of one person every 100 seconds, or about 864 people per day.[216] The United States is the third most populous nation in the world, after China and India. In 2020 the median age of the United States population was 38.5 years.[217] In 2018, there were almost 90 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for 28% of the overall U.S. population.[218] The United States has a diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[219] White Americans of European ancestry, mostly German, Irish, English, Italian, Polish and French,[220] including White Hispanic and Latino Americans from Latin America, form the largest racial group, at 73.1% of the population. African Americans constitute the nation's largest racial minority and third-largest ancestry group, and are around 13% of the total U.S. population.[219] Asian Americans are the country's second-largest racial minority (the three largest Asian ethnic groups are Chinese, Filipino, and Indian).[219] In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants.[221] Among current living immigrants to the U.S., the top five countries of birth are Mexico, China, India, the Philippines and El Salvador. Until 2017, the United States led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.[222] About 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs;[181] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[223] In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities had over two million (namely New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston).[224] Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.[225] As of 2018[update], 52% of Americans age 15 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 32% had never been married.[226] As of 2020, the total fertility rate stood at 1.64 children per woman.[227] In 2013, the average age at first birth was 26, and 41% of births were to unmarried women.[228] In 2019, the U.S. had the world's highest rate (23%) of children living in single-parent households; the rates in Canada and Mexico were 15% and 7%, respectively.[229] Language Main article: Languages of the United States English (specifically, American English) is the de facto national language of the United States. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English, and most states have declared English as the official language.[230] Three states and four U.S. territories have recognized local or indigenous languages in addition to English, including Hawaii (Hawaiian),[231] Alaska (twenty Native languages),[j][232] South Dakota (Sioux),[233] American Samoa (Samoan), Puerto Rico (Spanish), Guam (Chamorro), and the Northern Mariana Islands (Carolinian and Chamorro). In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than English.[234] According to the American Community Survey, in 2010 some 229 million people (out of the total U.S. population of 308 million) spoke only English at home. More than 37 million spoke Spanish at home, making it the second most commonly used language in the United States. Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (2.8 million), Tagalog (1.6 million), Vietnamese (1.4 million), French (1.3 million), Korean (1.1 million), and German (1 million).[235] The most widely taught foreign languages in the United States, in terms of enrollment numbers from kindergarten through university undergraduate education, are Spanish (around 7.2 million students), French (1.5 million), and German (500,000). Other commonly taught languages include Latin, Japanese, American Sign Language, Italian, and Chinese.[236][237] 18% of all Americans claim to speak both English and another language.[238] Religion Main article: Religion in the United States Percentage of respondents in the United States saying that religion is ""very important"" or ""somewhat important"" in their lives (2014).[239] The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment. The United States has the world's largest Christian population.[240] In a 2014 survey, 70.6% of adults in the United States identified themselves as Christians;[241] Protestants accounted for 46.5%, while Catholics, at 20.8%, formed the largest single Christian denomination.[242] In 2014, 5.9% of the U.S. adult population claimed a non-Christian religion.[243] These include Judaism (1.9%), Islam (0.9%), Hinduism (0.7%), and Buddhism (0.7%).[243] The survey also reported that 22.8% of Americans described themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply having no religion—up from 8.2% in 1990.[242][244][245] Membership in a house of worship fell from 70% in 1999 to 47% in 2020, much of the decline related to the number of Americans expressing no religious preference. However, membership also fell among those who identified with a specific religious group.[246][247] Protestantism is the largest Christian religious grouping in the United States, accounting for almost half of all Americans. Baptists collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism at 15.4%,[248] and the Southern Baptist Convention is the largest individual Protestant denomination at 5.3% of the U.S. population.[248] Apart from Baptists, other Protestant categories include nondenominational Protestants, Methodists, Pentecostals, unspecified Protestants, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, other Reformed, Episcopalians/Anglicans, Quakers, Adventists, Holiness, Christian fundamentalists, Anabaptists, Pietists, and multiple others.[248] The Bible Belt is an informal term for a region in the Southern United States in which socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a significant part of the culture and Christian church attendance across the denominations is generally higher than the nation's average. By contrast, religion plays the least important role in New England and in the Western United States.[249] Health See also: Health care in the United States, Health care reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States The Texas Medical Center in downtown Houston is the largest medical complex in the world. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the United States had an average life expectancy at birth of 78.8 years in 2019 (76.3 years for men and 81.4 years for women), up 0.1 year from 2018.[250] This was the second year that overall U.S. life expectancy rose slightly after three years of overall declines that followed decades of continuous improvement. The recent decline, primarily among the age group 25 to 64, was largely due to record highs in the drug overdose and suicide rates; the country still has one of the highest suicide rates among wealthy countries.[251][252][253] From 1999 to 2019, more than 770,000 Americans died from drug overdoses.[254] Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among blacks.[255][256] Increasing obesity in the United States and improvements in health and longevity outside the U.S. contributed to lowering the country's rank in life expectancy from 11th in the world in 1987 to 42nd in 2007. In 2017, the United States had the lowest life expectancy among Japan, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and seven nations in western Europe.[257][258] Obesity rates have more than doubled in the last 30 years and are the highest in the industrialized world.[259][260] Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight.[261] Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic by health care professionals.[262] In 2010, coronary artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most harmful risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease, substance use disorders, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.[263] U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially among blacks and Hispanics.[264] Government-funded health care coverage for the poor (Medicaid, established in 1965) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare, begun in 1966) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. Nonetheless, the United States remains the only developed nation without a system of universal health care.[265] In 2017, 12.2% of the population did not carry health insurance.[266] The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue.[267][268] The Affordable Care Act (ACA), passed in early 2010 and informally known as ""ObamaCare"", roughly halved the uninsured share of the population. The bill and its ultimate effect are still issues of controversy in the United States.[269][270] The U.S. health care system far outspends that of any other nation, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP.[271] However, the U.S. is a global leader in medical innovation.[272] Education Main articles: Education in the United States and Higher education in the United States Columbia University, founded in 1754, is one of the colonial colleges and the fifth-oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. American public education is operated by state and local governments and regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of five or six (beginning with kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[273] About 12% of children are enrolled in parochial or nonsectarian private schools. Just over 2% of children are homeschooled.[274] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world,[275] spending an average of $12,794 per year on public elementary and secondary school students in the 2016–2017 school year.[276] Some 80% of U.S. college students attend public universities.[277] Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[278] The basic literacy rate is approximately 99%.[181][279] The United Nations assigns the United States an Education Index of 0.97, tying it for 12th in the world.[280] The United States has many private and public institutions of higher education. The majority of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the U.S.[281][282][283] There are also local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition. In 2018, U21, a network of research-intensive universities, ranked the United States first in the world for breadth and quality of higher education, and 15th when GDP was a factor.[284] As for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. trails some other OECD (Organization for Cooperation and Development) nations but spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[285][286] As of 2018[update], student loan debt exceeded 1.5 trillion dollars.[287][288] Government and politics Main articles: Federal government of the United States, Politics of the United States, State governments of the United States, and Local government in the United States The United States Capitol,where Congress meets:the Senate, left; the House, rightThe White House, residence and workplace of the U.S. PresidentThe Supreme Court Building, where the nation's highest court sits The United States is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and several uninhabited island possessions.[289][290][291] It is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a federal republic and a representative democracy ""in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law.""[292] Since 2015, the U.S. has ranked 25th on the Democracy Index, and is described as a ""flawed democracy"".[293] On Transparency International's 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index, its public sector position deteriorated from a score of 76 in 2015 to 69 in 2019.[294] In the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The local government's duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district. The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document.[295] The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. Article One protects the right to the writ of habeas corpus. The Constitution has been amended 27 times;[296] the first ten amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of Americans' individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to judicial review, and any law can be voided if the courts determine that it violates the Constitution. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803)[297] in a decision handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall.[298] The federal government comprises three branches: Legislative: The bicameral Congress, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse,[299] and has the power of impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the government.[300] Executive: The president is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.[301] Judicial: The Supreme Court and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the president with Senate approval, interpret laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[302] The House of Representatives has 435 voting members, each representing a congressional district for a two-year term. House seats are apportioned among the states by population. Each state then draws single-member districts to conform with the census apportionment. The District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories each have one member of Congress—these members are not allowed to vote.[303] The Senate has 100 members with each state having two senators, elected at-large to six-year terms; one-third of Senate seats are up for election every two years. The District of Columbia and the five major U.S. territories do not have senators.[303] The president serves a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice. The president is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college system in which the determining votes are apportioned to the states and the District of Columbia.[304] The Supreme Court, led by the chief justice of the United States, has nine members, who serve for life.[305] Political divisions Main articles: Political divisions of the United States, U.S. state, Territories of the United States, List of states and territories of the United States, and Indian reservation Further information: Territorial evolution of the United States Map of the United States showing the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the 5 major U.S. territories The 50 states are the principal political divisions in the country. Each state holds jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, where it shares sovereignty with the federal government. They are subdivided into counties or county equivalents and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, the city of Washington.[306] The states and the District of Columbia choose the president of the United States. Each state has presidential electors equal to the number of their representatives and senators in Congress; the District of Columbia has three because of the 23rd Amendment.[307] Territories of the United States such as Puerto Rico do not have presidential electors, and so people in those territories cannot vote for the president.[303] The United States also observes tribal sovereignty of the American Indian nations to a limited degree, as it does with the states' sovereignty. American Indians are U.S. citizens and tribal lands are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts. Like the states they have a great deal of autonomy, but also like the states, tribes are not allowed to make war, engage in their own foreign relations, or print and issue currency.[308] Citizenship is granted at birth in all states, the District of Columbia, and all major U.S. territories except American Samoa.[k][312][309] State and district flags and statehood dates(listed alphabetically) Alabama: Dec. 14, 1819 Alaska: Jan. 3, 1959 Arizona: Feb. 14, 1912 Arkansas: Jun. 15, 1836 California: Sep. 9, 1850 Colorado: Aug. 1, 1876 Connecticut: Jan. 9, 1788 Delaware: Dec. 7, 1787 District of Columbia*: Jul. 16, 1790 Florida: Mar. 3, 1845 Georgia: Jan. 2, 1788 Hawaii: Aug. 21, 1959 Idaho: Jul. 3, 1890 Illinois: Dec. 3, 1818 Indiana: Dec. 11, 1816 Iowa: Dec. 28, 1846 Kansas: Jan. 29, 1861 Kentucky: Jun. 1, 1792 Louisiana: Apr. 30, 1812 Maine: Mar. 15, 1820 Maryland: Apr. 28, 1788 Massachusetts: Feb. 6, 1788 Michigan: Jan. 26, 1837 Minnesota: May 11, 1858 Mississippi: Dec. 10, 1817 Missouri: Aug. 10, 1821 Montana: Nov. 8, 1889 Nebraska: Mar. 1, 1867 Nevada: Oct. 31, 1864 New Hampshire: Jun. 21, 1788 New Jersey: Dec. 18, 1787 New Mexico: Jan. 6, 1912 New York: Jul. 26, 1788 North Carolina: Nov. 21, 1789 North Dakota: Nov. 2, 1889 Ohio: Mar. 1, 1803 Oklahoma: Nov. 16, 1907 Oregon: Feb. 14, 1859 Pennsylvania: Dec. 12, 1787 Rhode Island: May 29, 1790 South Carolina: May 23, 1788 South Dakota: Nov. 2, 1889 Tennessee: Jun. 1, 1796 Texas: Dec. 29, 1845 Utah: Jan. 4, 1896 Vermont: Mar. 4, 1791 Virginia: Jun. 25, 1788 Washington: Nov. 11, 1889 West Virginia: Jun. 20, 1863 Wisconsin: May 29, 1848 Wyoming: Jul. 10, 1890 (listed chronologically) Dec. 7, 1787:  Delaware Dec. 12, 1787:  Pennsylvania Dec. 18, 1787:  New Jersey Jan. 2, 1788:  Georgia Jan. 9, 1788:  Connecticut Feb. 6, 1788:  Massachusetts Apr. 28, 1788:  Maryland May 23, 1788:  South Carolina Jun. 21, 1788:  New Hampshire Jun. 25, 1788:  Virginia Jul. 26, 1788:  New York Nov. 21, 1789:  North Carolina May 29, 1790:  Rhode Island Mar. 4, 1791:  Vermont Jun. 1, 1792:  Kentucky Jun. 1, 1796:  Tennessee Jul. 16, 1790:  District of Columbia* Mar. 1, 1803:  Ohio Apr. 30, 1812:  Louisiana Dec. 11, 1816:  Indiana Dec. 10, 1817:  Mississippi Dec. 3, 1818:  Illinois Dec. 14, 1819:  Alabama Mar. 15, 1820:  Maine Aug. 10, 1821:  Missouri Jun. 15, 1836:  Arkansas Jan. 26, 1837:  Michigan Mar. 3, 1845:  Florida Dec. 29, 1845:  Texas Dec. 28, 1846:  Iowa May 29, 1848:  Wisconsin Sep. 9, 1850:  California May 11, 1858:  Minnesota Feb. 14, 1859:  Oregon Jan. 29, 1861:  Kansas Jun. 20, 1863:  West Virginia Oct. 31, 1864:  Nevada Mar. 1, 1867:  Nebraska Aug. 1, 1876:  Colorado Nov. 2, 1889:  North Dakota Nov. 2, 1889:  South Dakota Nov. 8, 1889:  Montana Nov. 11, 1889:  Washington Jul. 3, 1890:  Idaho Jul. 10, 1890:  Wyoming Jan. 4, 1896:  Utah Nov. 16, 1907:  Oklahoma Jan. 6, 1912 :  New Mexico Feb. 14, 1912 :  Arizona Jan. 3, 1959:  Alaska Aug. 21, 1959:  Hawaii Statehood date is the date of ratifying the Constitution (for the first 13) or being admitted to the Union (for subsequent states) *District of Columbia is a district not a state Territory flags and dates(listed alphabetically) American Samoa: Apr. 17, 1900 Guam: Apr. 11, 1899 Northern Mariana Islands: Nov. 4, 1986 Puerto Rico: Apr. 11, 1899 US Virgin Islands: Mar. 31, 1917 (listed chronologically) Apr. 11, 1899:  Guam Apr. 11, 1899:  Puerto Rico Apr. 17, 1900:  American Samoa Mar. 31, 1917:  US Virgin Islands Nov. 4, 1986:  Northern Mariana Islands Territory date is the date the territory was acquired by the United States.

Parties and elections Main articles: Political parties in the United States, Elections in the United States, and Political ideologies in the United States Joe Biden46th PresidentKamala Harris49th Vice Presidentsince January 20, 2021 The United States has operated under a two-party system for most of its history.[313] For elective offices at most levels, state-administered primary elections choose the major party nominees for subsequent general elections. Since the general election of 1856, the major parties have been the Democratic Party, founded in 1824, and the Republican Party, founded in 1854. Since the Civil War, only one third-party presidential candidate—former president Theodore Roosevelt, running as a Progressive in 1912—has won as much as 20% of the popular vote. The president and vice president are elected by the Electoral College.[314] In American political culture, the center-right Republican Party is considered ""conservative"" and the center-left Democratic Party is considered ""liberal"".[315][316] The states of the Northeast and West Coast and some of the Great Lakes states, known as ""blue states"", are relatively liberal. The ""red states"" of the South and parts of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains are relatively conservative. Democrat Joe Biden, the winner of the 2020 presidential election and former vice president, is serving as the 46th president of the United States. Leadership in the Senate includes Vice President Kamala Harris, President pro tempore Patrick Leahy, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.[317] Leadership in the House includes Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.[318] In the 117th United States Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate are narrowly controlled by the Democratic Party. The Senate consists of 50 Republicans and 48 Democrats with two Independents who caucus with the Democrats; the House consists of 222 Democrats and 211 Republicans.[319] Of state governors, there are 27 Republicans and 23 Democrats. Among the D.C. mayor and the five territorial governors, there are three Democrats, one Republican, and one New Progressive.[320] Foreign relations Main articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign policy of the United States Diplomatic relations of the United States  United States  Countries that have diplomatic relations with the United States  Countries that do not have diplomatic relations with the United States  Disputed territories  Antarctica The United States has an established structure of foreign relations. It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. New York City is home to the United Nations Headquarters. Almost all countries have embassies in Washington, D.C., and many have consulates around the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host American diplomatic missions. However, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) do not have formal diplomatic relations with the United States (although the U.S. still maintains unofficial relations with Bhutan and Taiwan).[321] It is a member of the G7,[322] G20, and OECD. The United States has a ""Special Relationship"" with the United Kingdom[323] and strong ties with Canada,[324] India, Australia,[325] New Zealand,[326] the Philippines,[327] Japan,[328] South Korea,[329] Israel,[330] and several European Union countries, including France, Italy, Germany, Spain and Poland.[331] It works closely with fellow NATO members on military and security issues and with its neighbors through the Organization of American States and free trade agreements such as the trilateral United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement. Colombia is traditionally considered by the United States as its most loyal ally in South America.[332][333] The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau through the Compact of Free Association.[334] Government finance See also: Taxation in the United States and United States federal budget U.S. Government spending and revenue from 1792 to 2018 Taxation in the United States is progressive,[335][336] and is levied at the federal, state, and local government levels. This includes taxes on income, payroll, property, sales, imports, estates, and gifts, as well as various fees. Taxation in the United States is based on citizenship, not residency.[337] Both non-resident citizens and Green Card holders living abroad are taxed on their income irrespective of where they live or where their income is earned. The United States is one of the few countries in the world to do so.[338] In 2010 taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.8% of GDP.[339] Based on CBO estimates,[340] under 2013 tax law the top 1% will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows.[341] For 2018, the effective tax rate for the wealthiest 400 households was 23%, compared to 24.2% for the bottom half of U.S. households.[342] During fiscal year 2012, the federal government spent $3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis. Major categories of fiscal year 2012 spending included: Medicare & Medicaid (23%), Social Security (22%), Defense Department (19%), non-defense discretionary (17%), other mandatory (13%) and interest (6%).[343] In 2018, the United States had the largest external debt in the world.[344] As a percentage of GDP, it had the 34th largest government debt in the world in 2017; however, more recent estimates vary.[345] The total national debt of the United States was $23.201 trillion, or 107% of GDP, in the fourth quarter of 2019.[346] By 2012, total federal debt had surpassed 100% of U.S. GDP.[347] The U.S. has a credit rating of AA+ from Standard & Poor's, AAA from Fitch, and AAA from Moody's.[348] Military Main article: United States Armed Forces The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS George Washington (CVN 73) The president is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Department of Defense administers five of the six service branches, which are made up of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force. The Coast Guard, also a branch of the armed forces, is normally administered by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and can be transferred to the Department of the Navy in wartime.[citation needed] In 2019, all six branches of the U.S. Armed Forces reported 1.4 million personnel on active duty.[349] The Reserves and National Guard brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million.[349] The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors.[350] Global presence of the United States military, showing Unified combatant commands Military service in the United States is voluntary, although conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System.[351] From 1940 until 1973, conscription was mandatory even during peacetime.[352] Today, American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force's large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy's 11 active aircraft carriers, and Marine expeditionary units at sea with the Navy, and Army's XVIII Airborne Corps and 75th Ranger Regiment deployed by Air Force transport aircraft. The Air Force can strike targets across the globe through its fleet of strategic bombers, maintains the air defense across the United States, and provides close air support to Army and Marine Corps ground forces.[353][354][355] The Space Force operates the Global Positioning System, operates the Eastern and Western Ranges for all space launches, and operates the United States' Space Surveillance and Missile Warning networks.[356][357][358] The military operates about 800 bases and facilities abroad,[359] and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.[360] The United States spent $649 billion on its military in 2019, 36% of global military spending.[361] At 4.7% of GDP, the rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders, after Saudi Arabia.[361] Defense spending plays a major role in science and technology investment, with roughly half of U.S. federal research and development funded by the Department of Defense.[362] Defense's share of the overall U.S. economy has generally declined in recent decades, from early Cold War peaks of 14.2% of GDP in 1953 and 69.5% of federal spending in 1954 to 4.7% of GDP and 18.8% of federal spending in 2011.[363] In total number of personnel, the United States has the third-largest combined armed forces in the world, behind the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Indian Armed Forces.[364] The country is one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and one of nine countries to possess nuclear weapons.[365] The United States possesses the second-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world, behind Russia.[365] More than 40% of the world's 14,000 nuclear weapons are held by the United States.[365] Law enforcement and crime Main articles: Law enforcement in the United States and Crime in the United States See also: Law of the United States, Human rights in the United States § Justice system, Incarceration in the United States, Police brutality in the United States, and Capital punishment in the United States The New York City Police Department is the nation's largest municipal law enforcement agency. Law enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local police departments and sheriff's offices, with state police providing broader services. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights, national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts' rulings and federal laws.[366] State courts conduct most criminal trials while federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States homicide rates ""were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher.""[367] In 2016, the U.S. murder rate was 5.4 per 100,000.[368] Total incarceration in the United States by year (1920–2014) The United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and largest prison population in the world.[369] As of 2020, the Prison Policy Initiative reported that there were some 2.3 million people incarcerated.[370] According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the majority of inmates held in federal prisons are convicted of drug offenses.[371] The imprisonment rate for all prisoners sentenced to more than a year in state or federal facilities is 478 per 100,000 in 2013.[372] About 9% of prisoners are held in privatized prisons,[370] a practice beginning in the 1980s and a subject of contention.[373] Although most nations have abolished capital punishment,[374] it is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and at the state level in 28 states, though three states have moratoriums on carrying out the penalty imposed by their governors.[375][376][377] In 2019, the country had the sixth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Egypt.[378] No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down the practice. Since the decision, however, there have been more than 1,500 executions.[379] In recent years the number of executions and presence of capital punishment statute on whole has trended down nationally, with several states recently abolishing the penalty.[377] Economy Main article: Economy of the United States See also: Economic history of the United States, List of companies of the United States by state, List of largest companies in the United States by revenue, and Lists of companies The New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street is the world's largest stock exchange (per market capitalization of its listed companies)[380] at $23.1 trillion as of April 2018.[381] According to the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. GDP of $22.7 trillion constitutes 24% of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 16% of the gross world product at purchasing power parity.[382][14] The United States is the largest importer of goods and second-largest exporter,[383] though exports per capita are relatively low. In 2010, the total U.S. trade deficit was $635 billion.[384] Canada, China, Mexico, Japan, and Germany are its top trading partners.[385] From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3%, compared to a 2.3% weighted average for the rest of the G7.[386] The country ranks fifth in the world in nominal GDP per capita[387] and seventh in GDP per capita at PPP.[14] The U.S. dollar is the world's primary reserve currency.[388] In 2009, the private sector was estimated to constitute 86.4% of the economy.[389] While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development, the United States remains an industrial power.[390] In August 2010, the American labor force consisted of 154.1 million people (50%). With 21.2 million people, government is the leading field of employment. The largest private employment sector is health care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people. It has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than most European nations.[391] The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation[392] and is one of a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right.[393] 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits.[394] In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway.[395][396] Science and technology Main articles: Science and technology in the United States and Science policy of the United States Buzz Aldrin on the Moon, 1969 The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large-scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles, and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor-saving techniques created the system of mass production.[397] In the 21st century, approximately two-thirds of research and development funding comes from the private sector.[398] The United States leads the world in scientific research papers and impact factor.[399][400] In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison's research laboratory, one of the first of its kind, developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera.[401] The latter led to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.[402] The rise of fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 30s led many European scientists, including Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and John von Neumann, to immigrate to the United States.[403] During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age, while the Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science, and aeronautics.[404][405] The invention of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active component in practically all modern electronics, led to many technological developments and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry.[406] This, in turn, led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions around the country such as Silicon Valley in California. Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel, along with both computer software and hardware companies such as Adobe Systems, Apple Inc., IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems, created and popularized the personal computer. The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements, and became the first of a series of networks which evolved into the Internet.[407] Income, wealth, and poverty Further information: Income in the United States, Poverty in the United States, Affluence in the United States, United States counties by per capita income, and Income inequality in the United States Accounting for 4.24% of the global population, Americans collectively possess 29.4% of the world's total wealth, the largest percentage of any country.[408][409] The U.S. also ranks first in the number of billionaires and millionaires in the world, with 724 billionaires and 10.5 million millionaires as of 2020.[410][411] The Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food affordability and overall food security in March 2013.[412] Americans on average have more than twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as EU residents.[413] For 2017 the United Nations Development Programme ranked the United States 13th among 189 countries in its Human Development Index (HDI) and 25th among 151 countries in its inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI).[414] Wealth inequality in the U.S. increased between 1989 and 2013.[415] Wealth, like income and taxes, is highly concentrated; the richest 10% of the adult population possess 72% of the country's household wealth, while the bottom half possess only 2%.[416] According to the Federal Reserve, the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country's wealth in 2016.[417] In 2017, Forbes found that just three individuals (Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates) held more money than the bottom half of the population.[418] According to a 2018 study by the OECD, the United States has a larger percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed nation, largely because of a weak collective bargaining system and lack of government support for at-risk workers.[419] The top one percent of income-earners accounted for 52 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2015, where income is defined as market income excluding government transfers.[420] After years of stagnation, median household income reached a record high in 2016 following two consecutive years of record growth. Income inequality remains at record highs however, with the top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all overall income.[421] The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top one percent, which has more than doubled from nine percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has significantly affected income inequality,[422] leaving the United States with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations.[423] The extent and relevance of income inequality is a matter of debate.[424][425][426] There were about 567,715 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in January 2019, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program.[427] In 2011, 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure households, about 35% more than 2007 levels, though only 845,000 U.S. children (1.1%) saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during the year, and most cases were not chronic.[428] As of June 2018[update], 40 million people, roughly 12.7% of the U.S. population, were living in poverty, including 13.3 million children. Of those impoverished, 18.5 million live in deep poverty (family income below one-half of the poverty threshold) and over five million live ""in 'Third World' conditions"".[429] In 2017, the U.S. states or territories with the lowest and highest poverty rates were New Hampshire (7.6%) and American Samoa (65%), respectively.[430][431][432] The economic impact and mass unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic raised fears of a mass eviction crisis,[433] with an analysis by the Aspen Institute indicating that between 30 and 40 million people were at risk for eviction by the end of 2020.[434] Infrastructure Transportation Main article: Transportation in the United States The Interstate Highway System in the contiguous states, which extends 46,876 miles (75,440 km)[435] Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of public roads.[436] The United States has the world's second-largest automobile market,[437] and has the highest vehicle ownership per capita in the world, with 816.4 vehicles per 1,000 Americans (2014).[438] In 2017, there were 255,009,283 non-two wheel motor vehicles, or about 910 vehicles per 1,000 people.[439] The civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned.[440] The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[441] Of the world's 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.[442] The United States has the longest rail network in the world, nearly all standard gauge. The network handles mostly freight, with intercity passenger service provided by the government-subsidized Amtrak to all but four states.[443] Transport is the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions by the United States, which are the second highest by country, exceeded only by China's.[444] The United States has historically been the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases, and greenhouse gas emissions per capita remain high.[445] Energy Further information: Energy policy of the United States The United States energy market is about 29,000 terawatt hours per year.[446] In 2018, 37% of this energy came from petroleum, 31% from natural gas, and 13% from coal. The remainder was supplied by nuclear and renewable energy sources.[447] Culture Main article: Culture of the United States For many immigrants, the Statue of Liberty was their first view of the United States. It signified new opportunities in life, and thus the statue is an iconic symbol of the American Dream as well as its ideals.[448] The United States is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values.[449][450] Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors immigrated or were imported as slaves within the past five centuries.[451] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[449][452] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.[449] Americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic, competitiveness, and individualism,[453] as well as a unifying belief in an ""American creed"" emphasizing liberty, equality, private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government.[454] Americans are extremely charitable by global standards: according to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67% of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied.[455][456][457] The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[458] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[459][460][461] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[462] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[463] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is also generally seen as a positive attribute.[464] Literature, philosophy, and visual art Main articles: American literature, American philosophy, Architecture of the United States, and Visual art of the United States Mark Twain, American author and humorist In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet.[465] A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851), Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925) and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird (1960)—may be dubbed the ""Great American Novel.""[466] Thirteen U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature. William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th century.[467] Popular literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States. The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo.[468] The transcendentalists, led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, established the first major American philosophical movement. After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey were leaders in the development of pragmatism. In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty, and later Noam Chomsky, brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick also led a revival of political philosophy. In the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[469] Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[470] Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Edward Weston, and Ansel Adams.[471] Food Main article: Cuisine of the United States Roasted turkey is a traditional menu item of an American Thanksgiving dinner.[472] Early settlers were introduced by Native Americans to such indigenous, non-European foods as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. They and later immigrants combined these with foods they had known, such as wheat flour,[473] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[474][475] Homegrown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.[476] The American fast food industry, the world's largest,[477] pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s.[478] Characteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants.[479][480] French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed.[481] Americans drink three times as much coffee as tea.[482] Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages.[483][484] Music Main articles: Music of the United States and American classical music Grammy Museum at L.A. Live Among America's earliest composers was a man named William Billings who, born in Boston, composed patriotic hymns in the 1770s;[485] Billings was a part of the First New England School, who dominated American music during its earliest stages. Anthony Heinrich was the most prominent composer before the Civil War. From the mid-late 1800s John Philip Sousa of the late Romantic era, composed numerous military songs—particularly marches—and is regarded as one of America's greatest composers.[486] By the late 19th century, the Second New England School (sometimes referred to specifically as the ""Boston Six"") became prominent representatives of the classical tradition, of whom John Knowles Paine was the leading figure. Although little known at the time, Charles Ives's work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin—eventually furthered by Leonard Bernstein—developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.[487] Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales.[488][489][490] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of America's most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the development of funk. More recent American creations include hip hop, salsa, techno, and house music. Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra,[491] and Elvis Presley became global celebrities,[487] as have artists of the late 20th century such as Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna and Whitney Houston.[492][493] Popular artists from the mid-1990s to late 2000s include Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera and Beyoncé. Well-known American singers of the 2010s include Katy Perry, Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande.[494][495] Cinema Main article: Cinema of the United States The Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles, California Hollywood, a northern district of Los Angeles, California, is one of the leaders in motion picture production.[496] The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope.[497] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[498] Director D. W. Griffith, an American filmmaker during the silent film period, was central to the development of film grammar, and producer/entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[499] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the ""Golden Age of Hollywood"", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[500] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[501][502] In the 1970s, ""New Hollywood"" or the ""Hollywood Renaissance""[503] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[504] In more recent times, directors such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and James Cameron have gained renown for their blockbuster films, often characterized by high production costs and earnings. Notable films topping the American Film Institute's AFI 100 list include Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941), which is frequently cited as the greatest film of all time,[505][506] Casablanca (1942), The Godfather (1972), Gone with the Wind (1939), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Graduate (1967), On the Waterfront (1954), Schindler's List (1993), Singin' in the Rain (1952), It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and Sunset Boulevard (1950).[507] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[508] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[509] Sports Main article: Sports in the United States The most popular sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball and ice hockey.[510] American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[511] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[512] Even on the collegiate level, college football games receive millions of viewers per television broadcast; most notably the College Football Playoff, which averages 25 million viewers.[513] Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB) being the top league. Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two leading professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association (NBA)[514] and the National Hockey League (NHL). College football and basketball attract large audiences. The NCAA Final Four is one of the most watched sporting events.[515] In soccer (a sport that has gained a footing in the United States since the mid-1990s), the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the men's national soccer team qualified for ten World Cups and the women's team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup four times; Major League Soccer is the sport's highest league in the United States (featuring 23 American and three Canadian teams).[516] The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[517] Eight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[518] As of 2017[update], the United States has won 2,522 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, more than any other country, and 305 in the Winter Olympic Games, the second most behind Norway.[519] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide.[520] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate Western contact.[521] The most-watched individual sports are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[522][523] Mass media Further information: Mass media in the United States See also: Newspapers in the United States, Television in the United States, Internet in the United States, and Radio in the United States The headquarters of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[524] Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.[525] In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions, and corporate underwriting. Much public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR.[526] NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, PBS, was created by the same legislation. As of September 30, 2014[update], there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[527] Well-known newspapers include The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and USA Today.[528] Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage.[529] With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have ""alternative weeklies"" to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as New York City's The Village Voice or Los Angeles' LA Weekly. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Aside from web portals and search engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, eBay, Amazon, and Twitter.[530] More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.[531][532] See also United States portal Index of United States–related articles Lists of U.S. state topics Outline of the United States Notes ^ English is the official language of 32 states; English and Hawaiian are both official languages in Hawaii, and English and 20 Indigenous languages are official in Alaska. Algonquian, Cherokee, and Sioux are among many other official languages in Native-controlled lands throughout the country. French is a de facto, but unofficial, language in Maine and Louisiana, while New Mexico law grants Spanish a special status. In five territories, English as well as one or more indigenous languages are official: Spanish in Puerto Rico, Samoan in American Samoa, and Chamorro in both Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. Carolinian is also an official language in the Northern Mariana Islands.[6][7] ^ The historical and informal demonym Yankee has been applied to Americans, New Englanders, or northeasterners since the 18th century. ^ a b c The United States is the third-largest country, after Canada, if coastal and territorial waters are included. If excluded, it is the fourth-largest, after China. Coastal/territorial waters included: 3,796,742 sq mi (9,833,517 km2)[20] Coastal/territorial waters excluded: 3,696,100 sq mi (9,572,900 km2)[21] ^ Excludes Puerto Rico and the other unincorporated islands because they are counted separately in U.S. census statistics. ^ See Time in the United States for details about laws governing time zones in the United States. ^ A single jurisdiction, the U.S. Virgin Islands, uses left-hand traffic. ^ Country code top-level domains are generally not used in the U.S.[citation needed] ^ .um was removed by ICANN in 2008, but is still recognized by the U.S. government as a country code top-level domain.[citation needed] ^ The five major territories are American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. There are eleven smaller island areas without permanent populations: Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Atoll, and Palmyra Atoll. U.S. sovereignty over Bajo Nuevo Bank, Navassa Island, Serranilla Bank, and Wake Island is disputed.[19] ^ Inupiaq, Siberian Yupik, Central Alaskan Yup'ik, Alutiiq, Unanga (Aleut), Denaʼina, Deg Xinag, Holikachuk, Koyukon, Upper Kuskokwim, Gwichʼin, Tanana, Upper Tanana, Tanacross, Hän, Ahtna, Eyak, Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian. ^ People born in American Samoa are non-citizen U.S. nationals, unless one of their parents is a U.S. citizen.[309] In 2019, a court ruled that American Samoans are U.S. citizens, but the litigation is onging.[310][311] References ^ 36 U.S.C. § 302 ^ a b c d ""The Great Seal of the United States"" (PDF).

Negotiations had been tough, and some leaders were more enthusiastic than others. But to everybody in the room, it was clear that this was a moment of clear moral purpose, a coming together of the global community to address critical global threats that no individual nation could tackle on its own. What Went Wrong? Nearly three decades on, we are further from a solution on these issues than we were then. In other areas, there have been great achievements. Real global output and incomes have much more than doubled since 1992, poverty has been reduced at a pace unparalleled in human history, life expectancy has increased dramatically, and technological progress has been stunning. But when it comes to collective action to protect global public goods, the governments of the world simply haven’t been up to it. In the past 10 years alone, global emissions of greenhouse gases have been greater than total emissions in the two centuries from 1750 to 1950, and scientists believe biodiversity loss to be proceeding at 1,000 times the natural rate. Today a million species are threatened with extinction. The past decade has not been humanity’s proudest moment, although there was a remarkable exception in the middle of the decade. In 2015, the world witnessed agreement on the Sustainable Development Goals and on climate action under the Paris Agreement. For a brief moment, it appeared that perhaps the era of cooperation could be rekindled. But in the five years since, we’ve seen little willingness to compromise for the common good. Worsening inequality within countries, and feelings of disempowerment and resentment among those left behind by globalization and technological change have focused attention internally rather than towards any global good. The 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets, set 10 years ago, are largely unmet. At the Madrid climate conference in December 2019, negotiators couldn’t agree on the time horizon for increased ambition, the basic rules for carbon markets or, in fact, almost anything at all. It is no wonder pundits have dubbed the past 10 years as “The Decade of Distrust” and “The Decade of Disillusionment.” Still Hopeful? So, as we enter 2020, why are we at WRI redoubling our efforts in the belief that this year – and the coming decade – can be different? We believe that seven factors provide a degree of hope that simply didn’t exist a decade ago. None of these on their own will bring about the required tipping point, but combined and in concert with smart political outreach, they can provide momentum for real systemic change. 1) Evidence That Can No Longer Be Ignored Nature itself is crying out at a volume that grows each year. Nineteen of the 20 hottest years in recorded history have occurred in the first 19 years of this century. The economic and human toll of extreme weather events, droughts, floods and lost natural habitats are forcing all but the extreme fringe to acknowledge the danger. New science – from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and many other sources – is reminding us that problems are more serious than we understood, and that under present trends, will grow in a potentially catastrophic manner. Watch, sadly, as more extreme climate-induced events in 2020 cause more suffering and build momentum for action. 2) Young Citizens Awakening Never before have 7 million people marched with such single purpose, inspired by a 16-year-old Time Person of the Year, Greta Thunberg. Never before have young activists been invited in number to address the United Nations, national parliaments and the World Economic Forum. As in the case of plastics over the past two years, this citizen action on climate is having impact around the world: Parliaments in 15 countries — ranging from France and the UK to Argentina, Bangladesh and Canada — have declared states of “climate emergency,” and 18 countries have now committed to a path towards net-zero emissions. In the 2016 U.S. presidential race, climate change was regarded as a losing electoral issue, while it is now center stage as candidates bid up each other in a determined effort to be strongest on climate. A key issue for 2020 will be whether the citizen movement becomes a truly global phenomenon. Watch the turn-out of the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day (April 22), and for the voice of activists at the Ocean Summit in Lisbon (June), the Biodiversity COP in Kunming (October) and the Climate COP in Glasgow (November). Watch to see if the theme of a “just transition” becomes central in advocacy in the lead-up to these meetings. Watch to see the tone and direction in the lead-up to November’s U.S. elections. 3) A New Economic Narrative A decade ago, the language of trade-offs prevailed. The benefits of protecting the global commons needed to be assessed alongside the costs in terms of money, jobs and economic growth. The fight was over discount rates. Would benefits far in the future justify costs today? Now a very different framing is taking root. The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, for example, demonstrated the opportunities of a “New Climate Economy,” in which smart climate policies can promote more efficient use of resources, induce new technologies, address pollution, and provide long-term stability of incentives, which, combined, can lead to gains in the short-term as well as the long. The language of costs and trade-offs is replaced by the language of investment and opportunity. This is expressed in different ways, including, for example, by President Xi Jinping’s famous “green is gold.” While this analytical journey has focused primarily on climate change, parallel insights are emerging from the High-Level Panel on a Sustainable Ocean Economy, and from a number of Business for Nature initiatives in the lead-up to this year’s Biodiversity COP. Watch to see this narrative spread in 2020. 4) Shifting Corporate Behavior The new economic narrative is beginning to take root in business schools and board rooms. Ten years ago, a small number of business leaders were making the economic case for action, but even fewer were acting. Today, while still a minority, the number is growing at an accelerating rate, and intent is leading to action. More than 750 major corporations have committed to Science Based Targets, and the number is growing. Nearly 200 of these have now upgraded their ambition to be consistent with the goal of keeping within a “1.5 degree warming world” (going beyond “below 2 degrees”). These commitments require transparency on both emissions and companies’ time-bound plans to decarbonize throughout value chains. Why are they doing this? Not because governments are requiring it (they aren’t), but because these vanguard companies believe it is smart business, increasing their efficiency, motivating their employees and customers, and, increasingly, attracting finance. The commitments now account for around 1 gigaton of emissions under scope 1 & 2, and nearly 4 gigatons under scope 3 (including value chains), equivalent to 10% of total global emissions. Watch if these commitments grow in 2020 to the extent that 20% of major companies in each sector join this group (a point at which experts believe the entire industry could “flip”). Watch to see if these leaders use their lobbying muscle to influence government policy and force their business associations into the new economic understanding of the 21st century. 5) Stirring of Financial Markets Until recently, financial markets had, at best, been neutral in their influence on sustainable investment decisions, and often downright negative due to their conservatism and short-term focus. A sea change is now underway, driven by a recognition of the serious risks associated with environmental change (both physical risks and stranded assets) and by the perceived opportunities from climate action. Change is thus being driven both by risk managers, including regulators, and by asset owners and financial intermediaries who see profit opportunity as well as moral purpose. Consistent with the new economic narrative, the view is spreading that by investing in high environment, social and governance (ESG), companies can, contrary to earlier views, increase yield over the medium- and longer-term. A deeper version of this includes the notion that a focus on shared value will lead to healthier, more profitable and more morally legitimate enterprises. These ideas are spawning an array of initiatives and coalitions of asset owners and institutional investors (Net Zero Asset Owners Alliance, Climate Action 100+), central banks, regulators and standard setters (Network for Greening the Financial System, Climate Disclosure Standards Board, Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB)), and a new Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action (which already has attracted 55 members). The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) has emerged as the leading force for global voluntary standards, and many insiders expect disclosure to become mandatory in key financial markets in the next few years. These are early days, but the lead-up to the Glasgow COP offers an important opportunity. Watch to see if the leaders of the various initiatives can make the whole add up to more than the sum of the parts, and thus form the beginning of a genuine movement. Watch, too, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney in his new role as the Secretary General’s Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. 6) Coalitions for System Change Achieving the change required cannot be done through incremental actions of individual actors. Coalitions of leaders — often involving government, private sector, science and civil society — are required to create movements for system-wide change. Encouragingly, we are seeing such coalitions across most of the key sectors. These include, for example, the Global Commission on Adaptation; C40 and the Coalition for Urban Transitions; the Food and Land Use Coalition, the New Deal for Nature and People and the Tropical Forest Alliance; the Powering Past Coal Alliance; the High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy; the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE); Champions 12.3 for food loss and waste; the Energy Transitions Commission for the “hard-to-abate” sectors; and many others. Such coalitions can play a vital role in clarifying the problem and the possibility of a solution, and for identifying actions that may be hard for individual players to take on their own, but make good sense when all act together. The best of such coalitions will create an upwards spiral of confidence and action – sometimes called “ambition loops,” in which leaders urge each other to take more ambitious action. Analysis of previous positive tipping points suggest that coalitions of frontrunners almost always play a positive role. At the present time, when multilateral collective action is so difficult, such plurilateral approaches are especially valuable. Watch the role of these coalitions in the lead-up to the major decision points in 2020. 7) New Leadership In the absence of U.S. leadership, a good deal of focus is understandably on potential deals between the EU, China, India and other major emitters. Recent decisions by the EU on its Green Deal, including its focus on a just transition, provide real hope. But there is also an emerging group of other countries that are insisting on ambition. So far, 79 countries have committed to raise their climate ambition in the lead-up to the Glasgow COP. While these account for only 10.5% of global emissions, their collective voice is proving effective. The group includes many vulnerable small island and African countries, which speak with moral authority. It also includes emerging countries like Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and South Africa. Important G20 countries like Indonesia are also stepping up. The country has completed a major Low Carbon Development Initiative, which demonstrates the positive transformation of its economy in the 2020-2040 period. The government plans to incorporate the findings in its upcoming five-year plan, with carbon emissions as a major indicator. Opportunities for Global Collective Action in 2020: Key Decision Points This will be a big year for the ocean, for biodiversity and nature, and for climate change. On the ocean, major decisions on protected areas, fishing subsidies, governance of the high seas, the ocean and climate, ocean data and finance, and much more will be discussed at the UN Ocean Summit in Lisbon in June, at the WTO in September, the Biodiversity COP in Kunming in October, and at the Climate COP in Glasgow. On biodiversity, the 10-year targets and policies will be negotiated under the Convention on Biological Diversity, and must be made much more accountable than the failing Aichi targets they will replace. They must also focus actions on the drivers of habitat loss as well as geographical targets. China’s role as host of the COP is an important opportunity. Watch to see if China joins other nations in monitoring and regulating the environmental impacts of its huge commodity trade and its Belt and Road Initiative. On climate, 2020 is crucial for the future of the Paris Agreement. Five years after the Paris Agreement was forged, countries are required to increase their ambition. So far, large emitters have been waiting on the sidelines. The coming months are critical. Care must be taken that commitments to move towards “net-zero” — which is not yet formally defined and may be politically easier— do not substitute for more ambition in the 2020-2030 period, which is what is required now. The UK, as president of the COP, has a major diplomatic task in the coming months. Watch to see if it and other leaders are able to harness the “Action Track” (the large number of commitments that will be made outside the negotiations) to increase the cooperative spirit of the negotiations. Watch if the new group of climate leaders can, together with leaders from the vulnerable small islands and African countries, create a spirt of positive cooperation. Watch for a potential deal among the big emitters, especially the EU and China. Watch to see if the Climate Adaptation Summit in October in Amsterdam delivers major progress on finance, agriculture and infrastructure, in turn expanding ambition in Glasgow. WRI’s Commitment This is a huge and exciting agenda. The stakes are very high, and nobody should anticipate easy success. The world is heading in the wrong direction, and turning it around will require disruptive systemic change across all areas of economic life. This is quite doable and affordable, and will lead to greater prosperity, greater equality and a much better quality of life. But inertia and vested interests are very powerful. At WRI, we are very proud of the work of our 1,000 experts and practitioners, and our many partners. We recognize that if we act alone, we will only scratch the surface. We are therefore committed to choosing our entry points carefully, always working unselfishly with others, and acting with intensity and humility. WRI staff in our 11 international offices (Brazil, China, Ethiopia, DRC, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Netherlands, Turkey, United Kingdom and the United States) are grateful for the deep partnerships we enjoy, and are committed to do all we can to make the coming year the tipping point it needs to be. More Denmarks? We are inspired by the brave leadership we are seeing in some communities, corporations, cities and nations. All of the major political parties in Denmark, for example, recently agreed on a target to reduce emissions by 70% by 2030, and become carbon neutral before 2050. They don’t yet know exactly how they will achieve these goals, but their ambition is leading to all kinds of innovation and the engagement of vibrant multi-stakeholder groups. Their goal reflects a deep understanding of what the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate has dubbed “the growth story of the 21st century.” Denmark’s economy will shift significantly as a result of this decision. It will sustain and grow its reputation for cutting-edge technology. Its citizens will enjoy cleaner air, better transport, less waste, more green spaces, and the knowledge that they are leaders in the revolution to give our grandchildren a well-functioning Earth on which to prosper.

The publication provides a comprehensive overview of steel industry activities, stretching from crude steel production to apparent steel use, from indications of global steel trade flows to iron ore production and trade. Edwin Basson, Director General, worldsteel, said, ‘We have said many times that the steel industry is at the heart of the global economy and equally so at the core of our sustainable modern society. Despite the influence of the pandemic, through its different regional impacts, the global steel industry was fortunate to end 2020 with only a minor contraction in steel demand. Steel use in China expanded while it contracted in the rest of the world. We look forward to normalisation in demand during 2021, owing to steady progress on vaccines and changed behaviour in the global society. We believe that the pandemic has accelerated some key trends, which will bring about shifts in steel demand. The steel industry will see exciting opportunities from rapid developments through digitisation and automation, infrastructure initiatives, reorganisation of urban centres and energy transformation.’ # Ends # Notes to Editors: The World Steel Association (worldsteel) is one of the largest and most dynamic industry associations in the world, with members in every major steel-producing country. worldsteel represents steel producers, national and regional steel industry associations, and steel research institutes.

49,"Small & medium-sized enterprises | National Action Plans on Business and Human Rights Skip to content Menu Explore by Country Issue Resources Tools & Guidance HRB Country Guides About Home > Issue > Small & medium-sized enterprises Small & medium-sized enterprises Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are defined as non-subsidiary, independent firms which employ less than a given number of employees. This number varies between countries, with the most frequent upper limit being 250 employees, as in the European Union. However, some countries set the limit at 200 employees, while the United States uses 500 employees. Small firms are generally those with fewer than 50 employees, while micro-enterprises have at most ten, or in some cases five workers. Financial assets can also used to define SMEs; in the European Union, SMEs must have an annual turnover of EUR 40 million or less and/or a balance-sheet valuation not exceeding EUR 27 million. The approximately 400 million SMEs are the backbone of economies around the world. They are the main source of job creation globally, accounting for over 95% of firms and 60%-70% of employment. SMEs generate a large share of new jobs in OECD economies, and even more in the EU, where they represent approximately 99% of all businesses, create around 85% of new jobs and provide two-thirds of the total private sector employment. Similarly, in the Global South, growth in overall employment is generally connected to the development of SMEs. [see, OECD Responsible Business Conduct in Georgia]. Considered key  to ensuring economic growth, innovation, job creation, and social integration, not least thanks to their close relations with employees, the local community, business partners, for example, they also make an integral part of global supply chains, both as buyers and suppliers [e.g., European Commission: SME portal]. The IFC estimates that globally there are roughly 9.34 formal million women-owned SMEs in over 140 assessed countries and also notes that the credit gap for formal women-owned SMEs across all regions is roughly $2872 billion, which is 30 percent of the total credit gap for SMEs. + Read more At the same time, SMEs have specific strengths and weaknesses that may require special policy responses. As new technologies and globalisation reduce the importance of economies of scale in many activities, the potential contribution of smaller firms is enhanced, with many of them being at the forefront of innovative solutions of relevance to human rights (e.g., The LifeStraw). However, many of the traditional problems facing SMEs – lack of financing, difficulties in exploiting technology, constrained managerial capabilities, low productivity, regulatory burdens – become more acute in a globalised, technology-driven environment. The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), Guiding Principle 14, states: “The responsibility of business enterprises to respect human rights applies to all enterprises regardless of their size, sector, operational context, ownership and structure. Nevertheless, the scale and complexity of the means through which enterprises meet that responsibility may vary according to these factors and with the severity of the enterprise’s adverse human rights impacts.” The Commentary to Guiding Principle 14 states that: “[T]he means through which a business enterprise meets its responsibility to respect human rights will be proportional to, among other factors, its size. Small and medium-sized enterprises may have less capacity as well as more informal processes and management structures than larger companies, so their respective policies and processes will take on different forms. But some small and medium-sized enterprises can have severe human rights impacts, which will require corresponding measures regardless of their size. Severity of impacts will be judged by their scale, scope and irremediable character. The means through which a business enterprise meets its responsibility to respect human rights may also vary depending on whether, and the extent to which, it conducts business through a corporate group or individually. However, the responsibility to respect human rights applies fully and equally to all business enterprises.” Despite clear references in the UNGPs and the role they play in the global economy, the importance of SMEs and their key role in creating a paradigm shift in how business is being done, has been largely neglected in the debate on business and human rights [e.g., ILO report.] Only more recently is attention being paid to the support needed by SMEs  to improve working conditions and develop more mature labour relations, such as inexpensive provision of working capital for investment in working conditions and other business practices, as well as training on occupational health and safety standards [e.g., recording of the 2015 UN Forum on Business and Human Rights session on “SMEs, informality and human rights: challenges and solutions”; WebTV]. At the same time, while for being part of the global supply chains, SMEs are often required to integrate and comply with their business partners’ Codes of Conducts, also contributing to behavioral change. While the majority of the guidance to business is better suited for large corporations, various actors undertook efforts to develop materials and guidance aimed particularly at the SMEs, with the purpose of raising awareness, building capacity and to understand the advantages of respecting human rights, for example, cost reduction or retaining and attracting the best staff or improving productivity and performance, or safeguarding the business’ reputation. The UK Equality and Human Rights Commission developed guides tailored to the specific needs of small and medium-sized businesses: “The Equality Act: Guidance for Small Businesses” and “Guide to Business and Human Rights”. In 2012, the European Commission published in all EU languages, “My Business and Human Rights: A Guide to Human Rights for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises”. Additionally, the United Nations Global Compact launched the Communication on Progress (COP) to help small and medium-sized enterprises with limited resources to regularly disclose progress on sustainability within their means. In May 2019, Switzerland published the Making Success Sustainable through Responsible Business Conduct: Human Rights Due Diligence of Swiss SMEs. It provides information for human rights risk assessments and an overview of the steps required to implement human rights due diligence. In order to support women’s empowerment, in 2008, the Dominican Republic adopted a law setting out a program of preferential purchasing to support SMEs and legislated that 20% of purchases through this program should be from businesses run by women. Under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, small & medium-sized enterprises are crucial for the achievement of a number of SDGs including SDG 8 on decent work and economic growth, SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and SDG 12 o(responsible consumption and production). They are also relevant for other SDGs aimed at ensuring poverty reduction and access to markets (e.g., SDG 2 (no hunger)), or decent work (SDG 8) among others.  Some countries have already launched support programmes for SMEs. These include financial support and guidelines such as Japan’s management plan, for SMEs that also help companies link their actions to SDG implementation; and Denmark’s SDG Acceleration for SMEs established in cooperation with UNDP. 8) Decent Work and Economic Growth9) Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure12) Responsible Consumption and Production References SMEs and the Corporate Responsibility to Respect Human Rights, Shift, 2019. What National Action Plans say on Small & medium-sized enterprises Belgium Action point 4 Promote existing qualitative initiatives on human rights and social responsibility Promouvoir les initiatives qualitatives existantes relatives aux droits de l’Homme et à la responsabilité sociétale The federal government explains that the Belgian National Contact Point will organize a seminar targeting the fight against corruption for SMEs with the provision of a practical toolbox prepared in partnership with the Belgian Confederation of Enterprises and the International Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Justice. The Flemish government plans a sustained and sectoral approach to social responsibility as companies operating in the same sector face similar challenges. Thus in consultation with the sectoral organizations, the Flemish authorities will support these organizations and their members in order to sustain their value chains and management of their businesses. In 2016, the Department of Labor and Social Economy will launch a call for the reduction of the difficulties of individual organizations (SMEs, social profit and other organizations) for the determination or for taking social responsibility. On the context of development of SMEs in South Africa, the NAP mentions that the strategy note aims at job creation through the development of SMEs. This priority is based on the recognition that the high unemployment rate in the labor force, especially among young people, is one of the most important underlying causes of inequality in South Africa. The collaboration between Flanders and South Africa therefore provides support services for SMEs in general and in the social economy sector in particular. The Flemish government is funding the project ‘Job creation through SME Development – A knowledge sharing project’. This project has a duration of three years (ends December 2017) and has the objective of creating a better business climate for SMEs by taking initiatives to facilitate the creation and development of SMEs through knowledge exchange, coordination and collaboration between interested parties. Action point 10 Belgium is committed to integrating human rights and corporate social responsibility (CSR) criteria into the local private sector development support strategy of Belgian cooperation La Belgique s’engage à intégrer des critères « droits de l’Homme » et de Responsabilité sociétale des entreprises (RSE) dans la stratégie d’appui au développement du secteur privé local de la coopération belge This point explains that strategy of the Belgian cooperation for development also aims at improving the access to financing for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and capacity building of MSME entrepreneurs. One of BIO’s purposes is to invest, directly or indirectly, in the development of MSMEs and social economy enterprises located in developing countries in the interest of economic progress and social security of these countries, while ensuring an adequate return. Action point 13 Strengthen and monitor the respect for human rights in public procurement Renforcer et contrôler le respect des droits de l’Homme dans les marchés publics The NAP states that the Flemish government intends to emphasize innovation, sustainability, professionalisation and access to SMEs within the Flemish public procurement plan for the period 2016-2020. Action point 14 Evaluate the Belgian label to promote socially responsible production Evaluer le label belge visant à promouvoir la production socialement responsible This point presents “the Belgian label” that was a product label created in 2002 and promulgated by law to promote socially responsible production. While the plan includes a reevaluation of the law, such an assessment will take into account the specificity of SMEs both in the analysis and proposals. Action point 19 Promote best practice of SMEs that adopt responsible supply chain management, especially through the  « CSR Compass » tool Promouvoir les bonnes pratiques des PME qui adoptent une gestion de la chaine d’approvisionnement responsable, notamment grâce à l’outil « CSR Compass » This point has a special focus on SMEs. Actions from the government of Wallonia will include the promoting vis-à-vis companies the ready-made instruments, also covering the CRS compass. Concretely, this will involve setting up workshops for exchanges between companies of the same sector and the creation of a practical guide for SMEs wishing to improve the ethics in their supply chain. Action point 31 Endorse best practice of businesses Mettre en avant les pratiques exemplaires des entreprises The government of Wallonia mentions an engagement that will consist of publishing the initiatives developed by companies and on the other hand Walloon initiatives supporting the adoption of practices respecting human rights by SMEs. Action point 32 Train companies in the field of respect for human rights Former les entreprises dans le domaine du respect des droits de l’Homme This point briefly mentions SMEs in the context of Wallonia’s engagement with educational and public policy initiatives. The NAP mentions that “public policy initiatives may target intermediaries to ensure that human rights issues are permanently and actively integrated into education and training activities. In this respect, a link could be set up with the “training voucher” system of the Walloon Region. The aim of this system is to promote the training of workers engaged in SMEs or self-employed persons in the Walloon Region. To this end, they are invited by the Walloon Region to participate in training courses during or outside normal working hours.” Read more about Belgium Chile Pillar 1: The State Duty to Protect Human Rights Strand 1: Training in the Field of Business and Human Rights Action Point 1.3 (pages 30-31) The Ministry of Labour will: Train businesses (guilds, confederations, associations and SMEs), unions and civil servants on business and human rights, emphasising labour rights.

Likewise, it will establish, if relevant, requirements about sustainability and respect for human rights, as criteria to choose the business enterprises participating in programmes to promote exports and corporate activities, including SMEs and micro SMEs. Disclose to business enterprises who are members of ProChile the United Nations Guiding Principles, thus helping, in this was and as far as possible, to incorporate them in their activities. It will do this through information available in the website, talks or sets of tools to strengthen their capabilities, and/or through the publication of handbooks containing the Guiding Principles or another suitable instrument, with special focus on information and training provided to SMEs.

Federal Government expectations regarding corporate due diligence in respecting human rights [page 8-13] Scope and practical structuring of due diligence in the field of human rights “The responsibility to exercise due diligence applies in principle to all enterprises, regardless of their size, the sector in which they operate, or their operational context within a supply or value chain with an international dimension. … Depending on the size of the enterprise, the nature of its products or services, the potential risk of particularly adverse impacts on human rights and the operating context, the measures to be taken are likely to vary in scope. It may be appropriate to conduct certain elements of the process in combination with other enterprises within an association or industry, subject to compliance with antitrust legislation. Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular should make use of the advisory and support services to be offered by the Federal Government and business associations under the National Action Plan.” Procedure for the identification of actual and potential adverse impacts on human rights “The size of an enterprise, the sector to which it belongs and the nature of its business activity directly influence the risk that its operations will have an impact on human rights. The required depth and breadth of the risk assessment depends on these factors.” Reporting “…At the same time, such reporting obligations should not impose disproportionate administrative burdens on the reporting companies or on the SMEs in their supply chains.” Measures “The Federal Government expects all enterprises to introduce the processes described above in a manner commensurate with their size, the sector in which they operate and their position in supply and value chains. Their compliance will be reviewed annually from 2018. In the absence of adequate compliance, the Federal Government will consider further action, which may culminate in legislative measures and in a widening of the circle of enterprises to be reviewed (see chapter VI below).” IV. Key areas for action [page 13] “It emerged from the process of dialogue and consultation on this Action Plan that the extent to which measures to be adopted to advance the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles would have to be binding would vary between these key areas. In addition to these measures, incentives and support services are to be created which would enable all participants, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to implement the Guiding Principles successfully.” 2.1 Ensuring the protection of human rights in supply and value chains The current situation [page 28-29] “the G7 are to: … in particular, assist small and medium-sized enterprises in developing a common understanding of due diligence and responsible supply-chain management.” 2.2 Transparency and communication regarding corporate impacts on human rights The current situation [page 31] “… Sponsored by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the Institute for Ecological Economy Research (IÖW) assesses the quality of sustainability reports from large enterprises and SMEs and draws up a league table for each of these categories. This ranking is intended to stimulate corporate competition in the realm of sustainability reporting and to highlight and propagate benchmarks for high-quality reporting.” 2.3 Business activity in conflict zones Measures [page 33] “The Federal Government is pursuing the aim of preventing the use of proceeds from the sale of tin, tantalum and tungsten, of their respective ores and of gold to fund armed struggles in conflict zones and other high-risk areas. It is committed to the establishment of binding due diligence rules, which should be proportionate and should not entail unnecessary red tape, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.” 3. Available means of practical implementation support [page 33-36] The Federal Government would like to assist small and medium-sized enterprises in particular in fulfilling the extensive corporate due-diligence requirements and expectations relating to human rights (see chapter III above). The current situation Numerous measures and services are already available for this purpose. A selection of existing and planned measures is described in some detail below: … The National CSR Forum, which was launched by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in 2009, consists of currently 41 members – high-ranking experts from business, trade unions, non-governmental organisations and research bodies as well as representatives of the participating federal ministries. Among the main tasks of the National CSR Forum are the provision of advice to the Federal Government on the continuing development of the national CSR strategy and the formulation of recommendations on specific issues. In 2010, the National CSR Forum, with the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in the lead role, discussed and developed a National CSR Action Plan. The measures and activities that have been carried out in the framework of the Action Plan have reached numerous enterprises. In a decision taken on 30 August 2012, the National CSR Forum expressed its support for “a smart mix of voluntary policy measures and, where necessary, complementary regulation” (2012, p. 11). Through the ESF promotion scheme for “social responsibility in SMEs”, more than 3,000 SMEs received advice and training in social responsibility, and regional CSR networks have been made permanent. Numerous specialised events have been staged in the framework of the CSR Forum to advise enterprises on the exercise of due diligence. … The Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development makes information and guidance available to enterprises of various sizes from various sectors, particularly by funding the work of the German Global Compact Network. Ever since 2004, the Ministry has been promoting the Network in close consultation with the Federal Foreign Office. The Network unites the German signatories of the UN Global Compact, whose core principles include respect for fundamental human rights and labour standards. As a business-driven multi-stakeholder forum, the Network has been providing training courses for management staff in the exercise of corporate responsibility for human rights ever since 2008.

Others, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, will find in this Action Plan the adequate tools to address this responsibility to respect human rights in the development of their operations. Guiding Principle 2 The State expects from Spanish companies, in Spain and abroad, a behavior consistent with its responsibility to respect human rights, which implies that they must act with due diligence, depending on their size and circumstances, to avoid the violation of the rights of third parties and to deal with the adverse impacts of their activity. Measure 8 The Monitoring Commission will design and submit to the Government the adoption of an incentive system that includes both large companies and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that carry out policies in the field of human rights. These incentives may be economic, commercial, visibility and image, or other nature, to encourage companies to have policies and reliably certify that they have implemented adequate procedures at a global level according to their size and circumstances, namely: A public commitment to assume its responsibility to respect human rights in accordance with the provisions of the Principle no. 16; A process of due diligence aligned with the sectorial guides regarding the OECD (due diligence guidance), and based on the dialogue with stakeholders that allows identification, prevention, mitigation, and accountability of how they address the impact of their own activities and those that are directly related to their business relationships in accordance with the provisions of Principles no. 17 to no. 21; Some processes that allow to remedy all the negative consequences on human rights that have caused or contributed to provoke according to what is established in Principles no. 22, no.29, no. 30, no. 31. Guiding Principle 3 Measure 6 “In accordance with the recommendations of the EU, the Government will promote information and training of SMEs and social economy entities, through all available means in business associations, and will promote the creation of sectorial forums of learning in order to discuss good practices and to reach commitments of interest for each sector.” Guiding Principle 6 Measure 2 “The Government will ensure strict respect for human rights by companies in commercial transactions with other companies, establishing the necessary measures so as to: not discriminate against SMEs; respect the provisions of the Treaty of the EU on non-discrimination; equal treatment and transparency: and no administrative charges are to be added to contracting authorities or companies.” Read more about Spain Sweden 2 The corporate responsibility to respect human rights [page 13] “The conditions for companies’ efforts to respect human rights vary depending on their size … In keeping with the UN Guiding Principles, businesses’ human rights efforts are expected to include the following main points: … Procedure: … Establish an integrated and ongoing process in the company to identify, prevent and manage human rights risks and opportunities, as appropriate to the size, nature and context of the operations, i.e. due diligence” Annex: Measures planned [page 28-29] How can the State support the business sector? “Central government will enhance its collaboration with the regional CSR networks in Sweden and take particular steps to strengthen the dialogue with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).” Trade promotion “Business Sweden (the Swedish Trade & Invest Council) will be instructed to strengthen its implementation of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and, in particular, to support small and medium-sized enterprises in this area.” Annex: Links [page 30] “The European Commission has produced a guide to human rights for small and mediumsized enterprises in Swedish, based on the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights.

Given their limited human resources and expertise on human rights, the management of potential human rights risks can pose a significant challenge for SMEs. Despite their good practices, they generally lack systemic responses to human rights-related issues. The concepts developed by international bodies like the OECD and UN must be presented in a way that takes into account the limited resources available to SMEs and the business environment in which they operate. SMEs are therefore encouraged to use the support measures provided by the federal government and umbrella associations. Measure 24: Support for industry initiatives The federal government will step up cooperation with industry initiatives, associations and chambers of commerce which promote the UN Guiding Principles, and support action taken by businesses to uphold human rights.48 This will involve identifying initiatives and actors which have the potential to substantially further the implementation of the UN Guiding Principles by businesses. Priority will be given to initiatives that contribute to due diligence training for business enterprises or that are developing practical and effective human rights tools for SMEs. All tools developed as part of initiatives supported and recognised under the NAP will be made available to the businesses online. Measure 26: Promotion of best practices The federal government intends to hold a Swiss Business and Human Rights Forum as part of its efforts to encourage and promote human rights best practices among businesses. The forum will provide stakeholders with a platform to discuss trends and challenges in implementing the UN Guiding Principles and foster dialogue and cooperation, particularly on the operational challenges faced by certain sectors. The forum will also help identify best practices for SMEs. Measure 29: Public-private partnerships to promote respect for human rights in the value chain To promote the implementation of labour rights and human rights by business enterprises, the federal government, together with the ILO, supports the Better Work programme for the textile industry and the Sustaining Competitive and Responsible Enterprises (SCORE) programme to support SMEs in creating decent working conditions. These projects are jointly run by the ILO, governments, the private sector and unions, and are focused on compliance with fundamental labour standards, including measures to combat child and forced labour. The tools developed by these programmes are shared with the private sector Measure 30: Guides and tools to implement the UN Guiding Principles Federal government will explore the possibility of translating some of these into the national languages to enable them to be adapted and implemented in Switzerland. The complex nature of these guides means that some companies, especially SMEs, may find it difficult to put them into practice. Easy-to-use online interactive tools could provide a starting point for SMEs. The Swiss government will develop instruments that enable SMEs to carry out risk assessments and identify measures. They also could provide the basis for an assessment of the action needed to improve human rights due diligence. Read more about Switzerland Thailand 3.

OverviewSmall and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play a major role in most economies, particularly in developing countries. SMEs account for the majority of businesses worldwide and are important contributors to job creation and global economic development. They represent about 90% of businesses and more than 50% of employment worldwide. Formal SMEs contribute up to 40% of national income (GDP) in emerging economies. These numbers are significantly higher when informal SMEs are included.  According to our estimates, 600 million jobs will be needed by 2030 to absorb the growing global workforce, which makes SME development a high priority for many governments around the world. In emerging markets, most formal jobs are generated by SMEs, which create 7 out of 10 jobs. However, access to finance is a key constraint to SME growth, it is the second most cited obstacle facing SMEs to grow their businesses in emerging markets and developing countries. image SMEs are less likely to be able to obtain bank loans than large firms; instead, they rely on internal funds, or cash from friends and family, to launch and initially run their enterprises. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) estimates that 65 million firms, or 40% of formal micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in developing countries, have an unmet financing need of $5.2 trillion every year, which is equivalent to 1.4 times the current level of the global MSME lending. East Asia And Pacific accounts for the largest share (46%) of the total global finance gap and is followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (23%) and Europe and Central Asia (15%). The gap volume varies considerably region to region. Latin America and the Caribbean and the Middle East and North Africa regions, in particular, have the highest proportion of the finance gap compared to potential demand, measured at 87% and 88%, respectively. About half of formal SMEs don’t have access to formal credit. The financing gap is even larger when micro and informal enterprises are taken into account. Formal MSME Finance Gap in Developing Countries What We DoA key area of the World Bank Group’s work is to improve SMEs’ access to finance and find innovative solutions to unlock sources of capital.Our approach is holistic, combining advisory and lending services to clients to increase the contribution that SMEs can make to the economy including underserved segments such as women owned SMEs.Advisory and Policy Support for SME finance mainly includes diagnostics, implementation support, global advocacy and knowledge sharing of good practice. For example we provide;Financial sector assessments to determine areas of improvement in regulatory and policy aspects enabling increased responsible SME access to finance Implementation support of initiatives such as development of enabling environment, design and set up of credit guarantee schemesImproving credit infrastructure (credit reporting systems, secured transactions and collateral registries, and insolvency regimes) which can lead to greater SME access to finance.Introducing innovation in SME finance such as e-lending platforms, use of alternative data for credit decisioning, e-invoicing, e-factoring and supply chain financing.Policy work, analytical work, and other Advisory Services can also be provided in support of SME finance activities.Advocacy for SME finance at global level through participating and supporting G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion, Financial Stability Board, International Credit Committee for Credit Reporting on SME Finance related issues.Knowledge management tools and flagship publications on good practice, successful models and policy frameworksLending Operations:SME Lines of Credit provide dedicated bank financing – frequently for longer tenors than are generally available in the market – to support SMEs for investment, growth, export, and diversification.Partial Credit Guarantee Schemes (PCGs) – the design of PCGs is crucial to SMEs’ success, and support can be provided to design and capitalize such facilities.Early Stage Innovation Finance provides equity and debt/quasi-debt to start up or high growth firms which may otherwise not be able to access bank financing.Results of Our WorkEarly-Stage SME FinanceIn Lebanon, the Innovative Small and Medium Enterprises (iSME) project is a $30 million investment lending operation providing equity co-investments in innovative young firms in addition to a grant funding window for seed stage firms. As of August 2019, iSME’s co-investment fund has invested $10.23 million across 22 investments and has been able to leverage $25.47 million in co-financing, demonstrating its ability to crowd in private sector financing and expand the market for early stage equity finance in Lebanon. To date, 60 out of 174 grantees had leveraged the iSME funding to raise a total of $13.1 million from various funding sources, a leverage ratio of 5.3 times. Overall, stakeholders’ consultations suggest that the iSME project could play an even larger role in the future financing of the Venture Capital (VC) sector by supporting existing VCs and emerging players, including increasing attention on a fund of funds approach, which could also cover growth funds (later stage and private equity). In India, our MSME Growth, Innovation and Inclusive Finance Project improved access to finance for MSMEs in three vital but underserved segments: early stage/startups, services, and manufacturing. A credit line of $500 million, provided to the Small Industry Development Bank of India (SIDBI), was designed to provide an affordable longer-term source of funding for underserved MSMEs. Technical assistance of about $3.7 million complemented the lending component and focused on capacity building of SIDBI and the participating financial institutions (PFIs). In addition to directly financing MSMEs, disbursing a total of $265 million in loans, the project pushed the frontiers of MSME financing through the development of innovative lending methods that reduced turnaround time, reached more underserved MSMEs, and crowded in more private sector financing. It also reached new clients, women-owned MSMEs, and MSMEs in low-income states. The project supported SIDBI to scale-up of the Fund of Funds for Startups, which aims to indirectly disburse $1.5 billion to startups by 2025. SIDBI’s “contactless lending” platform, a digital MSME lending aggregator and matchmaking platform, has crowded in $1.9 billion of private sector financing for MSMEs, making it the largest online lender in India.Lines of CreditIn Jordan, two World Bank Group’s lines of credit aim to increase access to finance for MSMEs and ultimately contribute to job creation. The $70 million line of credit encouraged the growth and expansion of new and existing enterprises, increasing outreach to MSMEs, 58% of which were located outside of Amman and 73% were managed by women. The line of credit directed 22% of total funds to start-ups. The project financed 8,149 MSMEs, creating 7,682 jobs, of which 79% employed youth and 42% hired women. The additional financing of $50 Million is progressing well towards achieving its intended objective. $45.2 million has been on-lent to 3,345 MSMEs through nine participating banks. The project is especially benefiting women, who represent 77% of project beneficiaries, and youth (48% of project beneficiaries), and increasing geographical outreach, as 65% of MSMEs are in Governorates outside of Amman.In Nigeria, the Development Finance Project supports the establishment of the Development Bank of Nigeria (DBN), a wholesale development finance institution that will provide long-term financing and partial credit guarantees to eligible financial intermediaries for on-lending to MSMEs. The project also includes technical assistance to DBN and participating commercial banks in support of downscaling their operations to the underserved MSME segment. As of May 2019, the Development Bank of Nigeria credit line to PFIs for on-lending to MSMEs has disbursed US$243.7 million, reaching nearly 50,000 end-borrowers, of which 70% were women, through 7 banks and 10 microfinance banks.Partial Credit GuaranteesIn Morocco, the MSME Development project aimed to improve access to finance for MSMEs by supporting the provision of credit guarantees by enabling the provider of partial credit guarantees in the Moroccan financial system to scale up its existing MSME guarantee products and introduce a new guarantee product geared towards the very small enterprises (VSEs). As a result of the project, the number and volume of MSME loans are estimated to have increased by 88% and 18%, respectively, since the end of 2011. Cumulative volume of loans backed by the guarantees during the life of the project is estimated at $3.28 billion. With significantly increased lending supported by guarantees, PFIs were able to continue building their knowledge of MSME customers, refining their systems to serve them more effectively and efficiently. Owing to guarantees, many first-time borrowers were able to generate credit history, which made it easier for them to obtain loans in future.Supporting Women-Owned SMEsIn Ethiopia, the Women Entrepreneurship Development Project (WEDP) is an IDA operation providing loans and business training for growth-oriented women entrepreneurs in Ethiopia. After identifying a persistent ‘missing middle’ financing gap for women entrepreneurs in Ethiopia, WEDP launched as a microfinance institutions’ (MFIs) upscaling operation, helping Ethiopia’s leading MFIs introduce larger, individual-liability loan products tailored to women entrepreneurs. WEDP loans are complemented through provision of innovative, mindset-oriented business training to women entrepreneurs. As of October 2019, more than 14,000 women entrepreneurs took loans and over 20,000 participated in business training provided by WEDP.  66% of WEDP clients were first-time borrowers. As a result of the project, participating MFIs increased the average loan size by 870% to $11,500, reduced the collateral requirements from an average of 200% of the value of the loan to 125%, and started disbursing $30.2 million of their own funds as WEDP loans. The average WEDP loan has resulted in an increase of over 40% in annual profits and nearly 56% in net employment for Ethiopian women entrepreneurs. In Bangladesh, the Access to Finance for Women SMEs Project aims to create an enabling environment to expand access to finance to women SMEs (WSME) by supporting the establishment of credit guarantee scheme (CGS), issuance of SME Finance Policy, and strengthening capacity of the regulator and sector. The project supported the issuance of Bangladesh’s maiden SME Finance Policy: stepping stone for boosting SME financing. Bangladesh’s first comprehensive SME Finance Policy was launched in September 2019 through concerted efforts in high-level upstream work, enhancement of the regulator’s capacity, and formulation of key recommendations with a sharper gender lens. In Bangladesh, $2.8 billion financing gap prevails in the MSME sector, where 60% of women SME’s financing needs are unmet, and lack of access to collateral is one of the key hindrances. Bangladesh lacked a single policy with systemic plan to enhance SME finance. With nearly 10 million SMEs contributing to 23% of the GDP, 80% of jobs in the industries sector and 25% of the total labor force, the SME Finance Policy will play a pivotal role in enhance SME financing.LeasingIn Ethiopia and Guinea, the World Bank Group is supporting the local governments in creating an enabling framework which is conducive to launching and growing leasing operations, as well as attracting investors, to increase access to finance for SMEs. It is doing so by working at the macro, mezzo, and micro levels, supporting the governments with legal and regulatory reforms, and working with industry players to create technical partnerships and increase market awareness and capacity. In Ethiopia, the project generated a $200 million credit facility supporting 7 leasing intuitions and introducing 4 new leasing products into the market: hire purchase, finance lease, microleasing and agrileasing. As of June 2019, 7,186 MSMEs have accessed finance valued at over $147 million. The project in Guinea supported the adoption of the national leasing law and the accompanying prudential guidelines for leasing, which in turn, have helped 3 companies to launch leasing operations. To date, these institutions have supported 31 SMEs through the disbursement of leases valued at $25 million.Who We Work WithLeveraging our expert knowledge, we work globally with public stakeholders and private sector intermediaries in partnership with other multilateral and bilateral development organizations to support SME Finance development in emerging markets and developing countries.

54,"Small and medium-sized enterprises - Wikipedia Small and medium-sized enterprises From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) or small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are businesses whose personnel numbers fall below certain limits. The abbreviation ""SME"" is used by international organizations such as the World Bank, the European Union, the United Nations and the World Trade Organization (WTO). In any given national economy, SMEs sometimes outnumber large companies by a wide margin and also employ many more people.[1] For example, Australian SMEs make up 98% of all Australian businesses, produce one-third of the total GDP and employ 4.7 million people. In Chile, in the commercial year 2014, 98.5% of the firms were classified as SMEs.[2] In Tunisia, the self-employed workers alone account for about 28% of the total non-farm employment and firms with fewer than 100 employees account for about 62% of total employment.[3] The United States' SMEs generate half of all U.S. jobs, but only 40% of GDP.[4] In developing countries, smaller (micro) and informal firms, have a larger share[of what?] than in developed countries.[citation needed][5] SMEs are also said[by whom?] to be responsible for driving innovation and competition in many[which?] economic sectors. Although they create more new jobs than large firms, SMEs also suffer the majority of job destruction/contraction.[6] Contents 1 Overview 2 Legal boundary on SMEs around the world 2.1 Africa 2.1.1 Egypt 2.1.2 Kenya 2.1.3 Nigeria 2.1.4 Somalia 2.1.5 South Africa 2.2 Asia 2.2.1 India 2.2.2 Indonesia 2.2.3 Bangladesh 2.2.4 Singapore 2.3 Europe 2.3.1 European Union 2.3.2 Poland 2.3.3 United Kingdom 2.3.4 Switzerland 2.4 North America 2.4.1 Canada 2.4.2 Mexico 2.4.3 United States 2.5 Oceania 2.5.1 Australia 2.5.2 New Zealand 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Overview[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (January 2017) SMEs are important for economic and social reasons, given the sectors role in employment. Due to their sizes, SME are heavily influenced by their Chief Executive Officer, a.k.a. CEOs. The CEOs of SMEs often are the founders, owners, and manager of the SMEs. The duties of the CEO in SME are difficult, and mirror those of the CEO of a large company: the CEO needs to strategically allocate her/his time, energy, and assets to direct the SMEs. Typically, the CEO is the strategist, champion and leader for developing the SME or the prime reason for the business failing[citation needed]. This definition is provided in Section 7 of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 (MSMED Act) and was notified in September 2006. The Act provides for classification of enterprises based on their investment size and the nature of the activity undertaken by that enterprise. As per MSMED Act, enterprises are classified into two categories - manufacturing enterprises and service enterprises. For each of these categories, a definition is given to explain what constitutes a micro enterprise or a small enterprise or a medium enterprise. What is not coming under the above three categories would be considered as a large scale enterprise in India. At the employee level, Petrakis and Kostis (2012) explore the role of interpersonal trust and knowledge in the number of small and medium enterprises. They conclude that knowledge positively affects the number of SMEs, which in turn, positively affects interpersonal trust. Note that the empirical results indicate that interpersonal trust does not affect the number of SMEs. Therefore, although knowledge development can reinforce SMEs, trust becomes widespread in a society when the number of SMEs is greater.[7] Legal boundary on SMEs around the world[edit] Multilateral organizations have been criticized for using one measure for all.[8][9] The legal boundary of SMEs around the world vary, and below is a list of the upper limits of SMEs in some countries. Africa[edit] This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Egypt[edit] Most of Egypt's businesses are small-sized, with 97 percent employing fewer than 10 workers, according to census data released by state-run statistics body CAPMAS. Medium-sized enterprises with 10 to 50 employees account for around 2.7 percent of total businesses. However, big businesses with over 50 employees account for 0.4 percent of all enterprises nationwide. The data is part of Egypt's 2012/13 economic census on establishments ranging from small stalls to big enterprises. Economic activity outside the establishments – like street vendors and farmers, for example – were excluded from the census. The results show that Egypt is greatly lacking in medium-sized businesses. Seventy percent of the country's 24 million businesses have only one or two employees. But less than 0.1 percent – only 784 businesses – employ between 45 and 49 people. Kenya[edit] In Kenya, the term changed to MSME, which stands for ""micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises"". For micro-enterprises, the minimum number of employees is up to 10 employees. For small enterprises, it is from 10 to 50. For medium enterprises, it is from 50 to 100. no Nigeria[edit] The Central Bank of Nigeria defines small and medium enterprises in Nigeria according to asset base and number of staff employed. The criteria are an asset base that is between N5 million to N500 million, and a staff strength that is between 11 and 100 employees.[citation needed][10] Somalia[edit] In Somalia, the term is SME (for ""small, medium, and micro enterprises""); elsewhere in Africa, MSME stands for ""micro, small, and medium enterprises"". An SME is defined as a small business that has more than 30 employees but less than 250 employees. South Africa[edit] In the National Small Business Amendment Act 2004,[11] micro-businesses in the different sectors, varying from the manufacturing to the retail sectors, are defined as businesses with five or fewer employees and a turnover of up to R100,000 ZAR. Very small businesses employ between 6 and 20 employees, while small businesses employ between 21 and 50 employees. The upper limit for turnover in a small business varies from R1 million in the Agricultural sector to R13 million in the Catering, Accommodations and other Trade sectors as well as in the Manufacturing sector, with a maximum of R32 million in the Wholesale Trade sector. Medium-sized businesses usually employ up to 200 people (100 in the Agricultural sector), and the maximum turnover varies from R5 million in the Agricultural sector to R51 million in the Manufacturing sector and R64 million in the Wholesale Trade, Commercial Agents and Allied Services sector. A comprehensive definition of an SME in South Africa is, therefore, an enterprise with one or more of the following characteristics: Fewer than 200 employees, Annual turnover of less than R64 million, Capital assets of less than R10 million, Direct managerial involvement by owners[12] Asia[edit] India[edit] India defines Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises based on dual criteria of Investment and Turnover. In June 2020, India has updated the definition as follows:[13] Sr No Classification Criteria (in ₹) 1 Micro Enterprises Investment <= 1 cr and Turnover <= 5 cr 2 Small Enterprises Investment <= 10 cr and Turnover <= 50 cr 3 Medium Enterprises Investment <= 50 cr and Turnover <= 250 cr Businesses that are declared as MSMEs and within specific sectors and criteria can then apply for ""priority sector"" lending to help with business expenses; banks have annual targets set by the Prime Minister's Task Force on MSMEs for year-on-year increases of lending to various categories of MSMEs.[14] MSME is considered key contributor in India's growth and contribute 48% in India's total export.[15] Indonesia[edit] In Indonesia, the government defines micro, small, and medium enterprises (Indonesian: usaha mikro kecil menengah, UMKM) based on their assets and revenues according to Law No. 20/2008:[16] Type Maximum assets, Rp Maximum revenue, Rp Micro 50,000,000 300,000,000 Small 500,000,000 2,500,000,000 Medium 10,000,000,000 50,000,000,000 An annual revenue of Rp 50 billion is approximately equal to US$3.7 million as of November 2017. Bangladesh[edit] In Bangladesh, Bangladesh Bank defines Small and medium enterprises based on Fixed Asset, Employed Manpower and Yearly turn over and they are definitely not Public Limited Co. and requires these characteristics - Serial No Sector Fixed Asset other than Land and Building (Tk) SE (Small Enterprises) & ME (Medium Enterprises) Employed Manpower Yearly Turn Over (Tk) (N/A-Not Applicable) 01 Services For SE 1000,000 - 200,00,000 & For ME 200,00,000 - 30,00,00,000 SE - 16-50 & ME - 51-120 N/A 02 Business For SE 1000,000 - 200,00,000 SE - 16-50 SE 10,000,000-120,000,000 03 Industrial For SE 7,500,000 - 150,000,000 For Me 150,000,000 - 500,000,000 SE - 31-120 & ME - 121-300 N/A Singapore[edit] With effect from 1 April 2011, the definition of SMEs is businesses with annual sales turnover of not more than $100 million or employing no more than 200 staff.[17] Europe[edit] European Union[edit] Small companies are important to the European economy as they account for 99.8% of non-financial enterprises in the European Union, and employ two-thirds of the workforce in the EU. [18][19] The criteria for defining the size of a business differ from country to country, with many countries having programs of business rate reduction and financial subsidy for SMEs. According to the European Commission,[20] SMEs are enterprises which meet the following definition of staff headcount and either the turnover or balance sheet total definitions: Company category Staff headcount Turnover Balance sheet total Medium-sized < 250 ≤ €50 million ≤ €43 million Small < 50 ≤ €10 million ≤ €10 million Micro < 10 ≤ €2 million ≤ €2 million In July 2011, the European Commission said it would open a consultation on the definition of SMEs in 2012. A consultation document was issued on 6 February 2018 and the consultation period closed on 6 May 2018. As of November 2019[update] no conclusions or responses have yet emerged.[21] In Europe, there are three broad parameters which define SMEs: Micro-enterprises have up to 10 employees Small enterprises have up to 50 employees Medium-sized enterprises have up to 250 employees.[22] The European definition of SME follows: ""The category of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is made up of enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding 50 million euro, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding 43 million euro.""[23] In order to prepare for an evaluation and revision of some features of the small and medium-sized enterprises definition European Union established public consultation period from 6 February 2018 to 6 May 2018. Public consultation is available for all EU member country citizens and organizations. Especially, national and regional authorities, enterprises, business associations or organizations, venture capital providers, research and academic institutions, and individual citizens are expected as the main contributors.[24] EU member states have had individual definitions of what constitutes an SME. For example, the definition in Germany had a limit of 255 employees, while in Belgium it could have been 100. The result is that while a Belgian business of 249 employees would be taxed at full rate in Belgium, it would nevertheless be eligible for SME subsidy under a European-labelled programme. SMEs are a crucial element in the supplier network of large enterprises which are already on their way towards Industry 4.0.[25] According to German economist Hans-Heinrich Bass, ""empirical research on SME as well as policies to promote SME have a long tradition in [West] Germany, dating back into the 19th century. Until the mid-20th century most researchers considered SME as an impediment to further economic development and SME policies were thus designed in the framework of social policies. Only the Ordoliberalism school, the founding fathers of Germany's social market economy, discovered their strengths, considered SME as a solution to mid-20th century economic problems (mass unemployment, abuse of economic power), and laid the foundations for non-selective (functional) industrial policies to promote SMEs.""[26] Only around 20% of European SMEs are substantially digitalized, compared to almost 50% of major businesses.[27][28] Small and medium-sized companies make up 56.2% of the non-financial sector. Smaller companies account for more than 60% of the value contributed to the non-financial sector in Belgium, Italy, and Spain, three of the nations worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. [29][30] An estimated 50% of Europe's small firms may fail because they lack the substantial financial reserves required to weather the crisis.[31][32] Poland[edit] The SME sector in Poland generates almost 50% of the GDP, and out of that, for instance, in 2011, micro companies generated 29.6%, small companies 7.7%, and medium companies 10.4% (big companies 24.0%; other entities 16.5%, and revenues from customs duties and taxes generated 11.9%). In 2011, out of the total of 1,784,603 entities operating in Poland, merely 3,189 were classified as ""large"", so 1,781,414 were micro, small, or medium. SMEs employed 6.3 million people out of the total of 9.0 million of labour employed in the private sector. In Poland in 2011 was 36.2 SMEs per 1,000 of inhabitants.[33] United Kingdom[edit] In the UK, a company is defined as being an SME if it meets two out of three criteria: it has a turnover of less than £25m, it has fewer than 250 employees, it has gross assets of less than £12.5m.[34] Very small companies are called in the UK micro-entities, which have simpler financial reporting requirements. Such micro-enterprises must meet any two of the following criteria: balance sheet £316,000 or less; turnover £632,000 or less; employees 10 or less.[35] Many small and medium-sized businesses form part of the UK's currently growing Mittelstand, or Brittelstand as it is also sometimes named.[36] These are businesses in Britain that are not only small or medium but also have a much broader set of values and more elastic definition. The Department for Business Innovation and Skills estimated that at the start of 2014, 99.3% of UK private sector businesses were SMEs, with their £1.6 trillion annual turnover accounting for 47% of private sector turnover.[37][38] In order to support SMEs, the UK government set a target in 2010 ""that 25% of government’s spend, either directly or in supply chains, goes to SMEs by 2015""; it achieved this by 2013.[39] Switzerland[edit] In Switzerland, the Federal Statistical Office defines small and medium-sized enterprises as companies with less than 250 employees.[40] The categories are the following:[40] Microentreprises: 1 to 9 employees. Small enterprises: 10 to 49 employees. Medium-sized enterprises: 50 to 249 employees. Large enterprises: 250 employees or more. North America[edit] Canada[edit] Industry Canada defines a small business as one with fewer than 100 paid employees and a medium-sized business as one with at least 100 and fewer than 500 employees. As of December 2012, there were 1,107,540 employer businesses in Canada, of rally. Canadian Controlled private corporations receive a 17% reduction in the tax rate on taxable income from active businesses up to $500,000. This small business deduction is reduced for corporations whose taxable capital exceeding $10M, and is completely eliminated for corporations whose taxable capital exceeds $15M.[41] It has been estimated that almost $2 trillion of Canadian SMEs will be coming up for sale over the next decade which is twice as large as the assets of the top 1,000 Canadian pension plans and approximately the same size as Canadian annual GDP.[42] Mexico[edit] The small and medium-sized companies in Mexico are called PYMEs, which is a direct translation of SMEs. But there's another categorization in the country called MiPyMEs. The MiPyMEs are micro, small and medium-sized businesses, with an emphasis on micro which are one man companies or a type of freelance. United States[edit] In the United States, the Small Business Administration sets small business criteria based on industry, ownership structure, revenue and number of employees (which in some circumstances may be as high as 1500, although the cap is typically 500).[43] Both the US and the EU generally use the same threshold of fewer than 10 employees for small offices (SOHO).[citation needed] Also in the United States, small and medium-sized manufacturers are referred to as SMMs,[44] which the US Department of Energy classifies as having gross annual sales below $100 million, fewer than 500 employees at the plant site, and annual energy bills more than $100,000 but less than $2.5 million.[45] Oceania[edit] Australia[edit] This section needs additional citations for verification.

(May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In Australia, a SME has 200 or fewer employees. Micro Businesses have 1–4 employees, small businesses 5–19, medium businesses 20–199, and large businesses 200+.[46] Australian SMEs make up 98% of all Australian businesses, produced one third of total GDP, and employ 4.7 million people. SMEs represent 90 per cent of all goods exporters and over 60% of services exporters.[47] New Zealand[edit] In New Zealand, 99% of businesses employ 50 or less staff, and the official definition of a small business is one with 19 or fewer employees.[48][49] It is estimated that approximately 28% of New Zealand's gross domestic product is produced by companies with fewer than 20 employees.[50] See also[edit] Confédération Européenne des Associations de Petites et Moyennes Entreprises (CEA-PME), an international federation of SME associations Environmental regulation of small and medium enterprises Hidden champions Mittelstand Small and medium enterprises in Mexico Small business References[edit] ^ Compare: Fischer, Eileen; Reuber, Rebecca (2000).

Our Mission As our mission the UNION will assist Member Institutions in their dealings with national policy and represent the interests of SMEs at International and UN- Organisations based on professional analysis of actual situations and the challenges and problems of SMEs in the 21st Century. Thus the UNION will efficiently contribute to present proposals for solutions and reforms on regional level that can improve the business environment for SMEs in the sense of the World Bank Group “Ease of Doing Business”. Establish itself as the premier international organisation advocating the interests of micro-small and medium enterprises (SMEs) at relevant international fora, before all national, regional and international bodies and with leading media that shape public opinion. Perform as a strategic resource for SMEs and the organisations that represent them world-wide, with focus on those in developing and less developed economies. Facilitate access of SMEs to know-how and best practices, through training, technology transfer and other business development services that will enable SMEs to develop their techno-economic capability, modernise their management skills, support proper use of the intellectual property system, improve their information system and knowledge of e-business.

Marseille (/mɑːrˈseɪ/ mar-SAY, also spelled in English as Marseilles; French: [maʁsɛj] (listen), locally [maχˈsɛjə] (listen); Occitan: Marselha [maʀˈsejɔ, -ˈsijɔ]) is the prefecture of the Bouches-du-Rhône department and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in France. Situated in the Provence historical province, it is located on the coast of the Gulf of Lion, part of the Mediterranean Sea, near the mouth of the Rhône. Marseille is the second-largest city in France, covering an area of 241 km2 (93 sq mi); it had a population of 870,018 in 2016.[4] Its metropolitan area, which extends over 3,174 km2 (1,225 sq mi), is the third-largest in France after those of Paris and Lyon, with a population of 1,760,653 as of 2017,[3] or 3,100,329 (2019) by the broader Eurostat definition of metropolitan region.[5] Its inhabitants are called Marseillais. Founded around 600 BC by Greek settlers from Phocaea, Marseille is the oldest city of France, as well as one of Europe's oldest continuously inhabited settlements.[6][7] It was known to the ancient Greeks as Massalia (Greek: Μασσαλία, romanized: Massalía) and to Romans as Massilia.[6][8] Marseille has been a trading port since ancient times. In particular, it experienced a considerable commercial boom during the colonial period and especially during the 19th century, becoming a prosperous industrial and trading city. Nowadays the Old Port still lies at the heart of the city where the manufacturing of soap, its famous savon de Marseille, began some 6 centuries ago. Overlooking the port is the Basilica of Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde or ""Bonne-mère"" for the people of Marseille, a Romano-Byzantine church and the symbol of the city. Inherited from this past, the Grand Port Maritime de Marseille (GPMM) and the maritime economy are major poles of regional and national activity and Marseille remains the first French port, the second Mediterranean port and the fifth European port.[9] Since its origins, Marseille's openness to the Mediterranean Sea has made it a cosmopolitan city marked by cultural and economic exchanges with Southern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and Asia. In Europe, the city has the third largest Jewish community after London and Paris.[10] In the 1990s, the Euroméditerranée project for economic development and urban renewal was launched. New infrastructures and renovations were carried out in the 2000s and 2010s: the tramway, the renovation of the Hôtel-Dieu into a luxury hotel, the expansion of the Velodrome Stadium, the CMA CGM Tower, as well as other quayside museums such as the Museum of Civilisations of Europe and the Mediterranean (MuCEM). As a result, Marseille now has the most museums in France after Paris. The city was named European Capital of Culture in 2013 and European Capital of Sport in 2017. Additionally, Marseille hosted matches at the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2016. It is also home to several higher education institutions in the region, including the University of Aix-Marseille.

To the east, starting in the small fishing village of Callelongue on the outskirts of Marseille and stretching as far as Cassis, are the Calanques, a rugged coastal area interspersed with small fjord-like inlets. Farther east still are the Sainte-Baume (a 1,147 m (3,763 ft) mountain ridge rising from a forest of deciduous trees), the city of Toulon and the French Riviera. To the north of Marseille, beyond the low Garlaban and Etoile mountain ranges, is the 1,011 m (3,317 ft) Mont Sainte Victoire. To the west of Marseille is the former artists' colony of l'Estaque; farther west are the Côte Bleue, the Gulf of Lion and the Camargue region in the Rhône delta. The airport lies to the north west of the city at Marignane on the Étang de Berre.[11] The city's main thoroughfare (the wide boulevard called the Canebière) stretches eastward from the Old Port to the Réformés quarter. Two large forts flank the entrance to the Old Port—Fort Saint-Nicolas[a][12] on the south side and Fort Saint-Jean on the north. Farther out in the Bay of Marseille is the Frioul archipelago which comprises four islands, one of which, If, is the location of Château d'If, made famous by the Dumas novel The Count of Monte Cristo. The main commercial centre of the city intersects with the Canebière at Rue St Ferréol and the Centre Bourse (one of the city's main shopping malls). The centre of Marseille has several pedestrianised zones, most notably Rue St Ferréol, Cours Julien near the Music Conservatory, the Cours Honoré-d'Estienne-d'Orves off the Old Port and the area around the Hôtel de Ville. To the south east of central Marseille in the 6th arrondissement are the Prefecture and the monumental fountain of Place Castellane, an important bus and metro interchange. To the south west are the hills of the 7th and 8th arrondissements, dominated by the basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde. Marseille's main railway station—Gare de Marseille Saint-Charles—is north of the Centre Bourse in the 1st arrondissement; it is linked by the Boulevard d'Athènes to the Canebière.[11] History[edit] Main articles: History of Marseille and Timeline of Marseille Marseille and Calanques National Park from the ISS, February 2017 Notre-Dame de la Garde from above, July 2020 A silver drachma inscribed with MASSA[LIA] (ΜΑΣΣΑ[ΛΙΑ]), dated 375–200 BC, during the Hellenistic period of Marseille, bearing the head of the Greek goddess Artemis on the obverse and a lion on the reverse Marseille was founded as the Greek colony of Massalia circa 600 BC, and was populated by Greek settlers from Phocaea (modern Foça, Turkey). It became the preeminent Greek polis in the Hellenized region of southern Gaul.[13] The city-state sided with the Roman Republic against Carthage during the Second Punic War (218–201 BC), retaining its independence and commercial empire throughout the western Mediterranean even as Rome expanded into Western Europe and North Africa. However, the city lost its independence following the Roman Siege of Massilia in 49 BC, during Caesar's Civil War, in which Massalia sided with the exiled faction at war with Julius Caesar. Afterward the Gallo-Roman culture was initiated. Marseille continued to prosper as a Gallo-Roman city, becoming an early center of Christianity during the Western Roman Empire.[citation needed] The city maintained its position as a premier maritime trading hub even after its capture by the Visigoths in the 5th century AD, although the city went into decline following the sack of 739 AD by the forces of Charles Martel. It became part of the County of Provence during the 10th century, although its renewed prosperity was curtailed by the Black Death of the 14th century and a sack of the city by the Crown of Aragon in 1423. The city's fortunes rebounded with the ambitious building projects of René of Anjou, Count of Provence, who strengthened the city's fortifications during the mid-15th century. During the 16th century the city hosted a naval fleet with the combined forces of the Franco-Ottoman alliance, which threatened the ports and navies of the Genoese Republic.[14] Marseille lost a significant portion of its population during the Great Plague of Marseille in 1720, but the population had recovered by mid-century. In 1792, the city became a focal point of the French Revolution and though France's national anthem was born in Strasbourg, it was first sung in Paris by volunteers from Marseille, hence the name the crowd gave it: La Marseillaise. The Industrial Revolution and establishment of the French Empire during the 19th century allowed for further expansion of the city, although it was occupied by the German Wehrmacht in November 1942 and subsequently heavily damaged during World War II. The city has since become a major center for immigrant communities from former French colonies, such as French Algeria. Economy[edit] Marseille is a major French centre for trade and industry, with excellent transportation infrastructure (roads, sea port and airport). Marseille Provence Airport is the fourth largest in France. In May 2005, the French financial magazine L'Expansion named Marseille the most dynamic of France's large cities, citing figures showing that 7,200 companies had been created in the city since 2000.[15] Marseille is also France's second largest research centre with 3,000 research scientists within Aix Marseille University.[citation needed] As of 2014[update], the Marseille metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $60.3 billion, or $36,127 per capita (purchasing power parity).[16] Port[edit] Main articles: Marseille-Fos Port, Old Port of Marseille, and Docks (Marseille) The entrance to the Old Port, flanked by Fort Saint-Jean and Fort Saint-Nicolas Historically, the economy of Marseille was dominated by its role as a port of the French Empire, linking the North African colonies of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia with Metropolitan France. The Old Port was replaced as the main port for trade by the Port de la Joliette (now part of Marseille-Fos Port) during the Second Empire and now contains restaurants, offices, bars and hotels and functions mostly as a private marina. The majority of the port and docks, which experienced decline in the 1970s after the oil crisis, have been recently redeveloped with funds from the European Union. Fishing remains important in Marseille and the food economy of Marseille is fed by the local catch; a daily fish market is still held on the Quai des Belges of the Old Port. The economy of Marseille and its region is still linked to its commercial port, the first French port and the fifth European port by cargo tonnage, which lies north of the Old Port and eastern in Fos-sur-Mer. Some 45,000 jobs are linked to the port activities and it represents 4 billion euros added value to the regional economy.[17] 100 million tons of freight pass annually through the port, 60% of which is petroleum, making it number one in France and the Mediterranean and number three in Europe. However, in the early 2000s, the growth in container traffic was being stifled by the constant strikes and social upheaval.[18] The port is among the 20th firsts in Europe for container traffic with 1,062,408 TEU and new infrastructures have already raised the capacity to 2M TEU.[19] Petroleum refining and shipbuilding are the principal industries, but chemicals, soap, glass, sugar, building materials, plastics, textiles, olive oil, and processed foods are also important products.[citation needed] Marseille is connected with the Rhône via a canal and thus has access to the extensive waterway network of France. Petroleum is shipped northward to the Paris basin by pipeline. The city also serves as France's leading centre of oil refining. Companies, services and high technologies[edit] From left to right: La Joliette neighbourhood (old docks), ferry ship docks, new port, Euroméditerranée business district (CMA CGM Tower) and surrounding areas In recent years, the city has also experienced a large growth in service sector employment and a switch from light manufacturing to a cultural, high-tech economy.[citation needed] The Marseille region is home to thousands of companies, 90% of which are small and medium enterprises with less than 500 employees.[20][full citation needed] Among the most famous ones are CMA CGM, container-shipping giant; Compagnie maritime d'expertises (Comex), world leader in sub-sea engineering and hydraulic systems; Airbus Helicopters, an Airbus division; Azur Promotel, an active real estate development company; La Provence, the local daily newspaper; RTM, Marseille's public transport company; and Société Nationale Maritime Corse Méditerranée (SNCM), a major operator in passenger, vehicle and freight transportation in the Western Mediterranean. The urban operation Euroméditerranée has developed a large offer of offices and thus Marseille hosts one of the main business district in France. Marseille is the home of three main technopoles: Château-Gombert (technological innovations), Luminy (biotechnology) and La Belle de Mai (17,000 sq.m. of offices dedicated to multimedia activities).[21][22] Tourism and attractions[edit] Pointe Rouge Beach Palais du Pharo The port is also an important arrival base for millions of people each year, with 2.4 million including 890,100 from cruise ships.[17] With its beaches, history, architecture and culture (24 museums and 42 theatres), Marseille is one of the most visited cities in France, with 4.1 million visitors in 2012.[23] Marseille is ranked 86th in the world for business tourism and events, advancing from the 150th spot one year before.[citation needed] The number of congress days hosted on its territory increased from 109,000 in 1996 to almost 300,000 in 2011.[citation needed] They take place in three main sites, the Palais du Pharo, Palais des Congrès et des Expositions (Parc Chanot) and World Trade Center.[24] In 2012 Marseille hosted the World Water Forum. Several urban projects have been developed to make Marseille attractive. Thus new parks, museums, public spaces and real estate projects aim to improve the city's quality of life (Parc du 26e Centenaire, Old Port of Marseille,[25] numerous places in Euroméditerranée) to attract firms and people. Marseille municipality acts to develop Marseille as a regional nexus for entertainment in the south of France with high concentration of museums, cinemas, theatres, clubs, bars, restaurants, fashion shops, hotels, and art galleries. Employment[edit] Unemployment in the economy fell from 20% in 1995 to 14% in 2004.[26] However, Marseille unemployment rate remains higher than the national average. In some parts of Marseille, youth unemployment is reported to be as high as 40%.[27] Administration[edit] Main articles: Arrondissements of Marseille and Cantons of Marseille The sectors and arrondissements of Marseille Political majority in each sector since 2014 The city of Marseille is divided into 16 municipal arrondissements, which are themselves informally divided into 111 neighbourhoods (French: quartiers). The arrondissements are regrouped in pairs, into 8 sectors, each with a mayor and council (like the arrondissements in Paris and Lyon).[28] Municipal elections are held every six years and are carried out by sector. There are 303 councilmembers in total, two-thirds sitting in the sector councils and one third in the city council. The 9th arrondissement of Marseille is the largest in terms of area because it comprises parts of Calanques National Park. With a population of 89,316 (2007), the 13th arrondissement of Marseille is the most populous one. From 1950 to the mid-1990s, Marseille was a Socialist (PS) and Communist (PCF) stronghold. Gaston Defferre (PS) was consecutively reelected six times as Mayor of Marseille from 1953 until his death in 1986. He was succeeded by Robert Vigouroux of the European Democratic and Social Rally (RDSE). Jean-Claude Gaudin of the conservative UMP was elected Mayor of Marseille in 1995. Gaudin was reelected in 2001, 2008 and 2014. In recent years, the Communist Party has lost most of its strength in the northern boroughs of the city, whereas the National Front has received significant support. At the last municipal election in 2014, Marseille was divided between the northern arrondissements dominated by the left (PS) and far-right (FN) and the southern part of town dominated by the conservative (UMP). Marseille is also divided in twelve cantons, each of them sending two members to the Departmental Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône department. Mayors of Marseille since the beginning of the 20th century[edit] Gaston Defferre served as Mayor of Marseille from 1953 to 1986. Jean-Claude Gaudin served as Mayor of Marseille from 1995 to 2020.

Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (June 2017) Because of its pre-eminence as a Mediterranean port, Marseille has always been one of the main gateways into France. This has attracted many immigrants and made Marseille a cosmopolitan melting pot. By the end of the 18th century about half the population originated from elsewhere in Provence mostly and also from southern France.[31][32][page needed] Economic conditions and political unrest in Europe and the rest of the world brought several other waves of immigrants during the 20th century: Greeks and Italians started arriving at the end of the 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century, up to 40% of the city's population was of Italian origin;[33] Russians in 1917; Armenians in 1915 and 1923; Vietnamese in the 1920s, 1954 and after 1975;[34] Corsicans during the 1920s and 1930s; Spanish after 1936; Maghrebis (both Arab and Berber) in the inter-war period; Sub-Saharan Africans after 1945; Maghrebi Jews in the 1950s and 1960s; the Pieds-Noirs from the former French Algeria in 1962; and then from Comoros. In 2006, it was reported that 70,000 city residents were considered to be of Maghrebi origin, mostly from Algeria. The second largest group in Marseille in terms of single nationalities were from the Comoros, amounting to some 45,000 people.[33] Currently, over one third of the population of Marseille can trace their roots back to Italy.[35] Marseille also has the second-largest Corsican and Armenian populations of France. Other significant communities include Maghrebis, Turks, Comorians, Chinese, and Vietnamese.[36] In 1999, in several arrondissements, about 40% of the young people under 18 were of Maghrebi origin (at least one immigrant parent).[37] Since 2013 a significant number of Central- and Eastern European immigrants have settled in Marseille, attracted by better job opportunities and the good climate of this Mediterranean city. The main nationalities of the immigrants are Romanians and Poles.[38] Largest groups of foreign residents Nationality Population (2014)[39] Algeria 41,987 Tunisia 10,918 Morocco 8,411 Comoros 7,889 Italy 4,927 Turkey 4,497 Spain 2,717 Portugal 2,382 Romania 2,308 Senegal 2,150 Madagascar 1,869 Vietnam 1,606 Russia 1,359 China[b] 1,200 Lebanon 1,155 Place of birth of residents of the city proper of Marseille in 1999 Born in Metropolitan France Born outside Metropolitan France 78.9% 21.1% Born inOverseas France Born in foreign countries with French citizenship at birth1 EU-15 immigrants2 Non-EU-15 immigrants 0.9% 8.8% 2.1% 9.3% Place of birth of residents of the metropolitan area of Marseille in 1999 Born in metropolitan France Born outside metropolitan France 81.2% 18.8% Born inoverseas France Born in foreign countries with French citizenship at birth1 EU-15 immigrants2 Non-EU-15 immigrants 0.7% N/A% N/A% N/A% 1 This group is made up largely of former French settlers, such as Pieds-Noirs in Northwest Africa, followed by former colonial citizens who had French citizenship at birth (such as was often the case for the native elite in French colonies), as well as to a lesser extent foreign-born children of French expatriates. Note that a foreign country is understood as a country not part of France in 1999, so a person born for example in 1950 in Algeria, when Algeria was an integral part of France, is nonetheless listed as a person born in a foreign country in French statistics. 2 An immigrant is a person born in a foreign country not having French citizenship at birth. Note that an immigrant may have acquired French citizenship since moving to France, but is still considered an immigrant in French statistics. On the other hand, persons born in France with foreign citizenship (the children of immigrants) are not listed as immigrants. Religion[edit] According to data from 2010, major religious communities in Marseille include: Roman Catholic (415,000 or 38.5%)[40] Muslim (264,000 or 25%) Non-religious (156.000 or 14.5%) Armenian Apostolic (80,000 or 7.5%) Protestant (mostly Pentecostal) (75,000 or 7.1%) Jewish (52,000 or 4.9%) Eastern Orthodox (15,000 or 1.4%) Hindu (4,000 or 0.4%) Buddhist (3,000 or 0.3%).[41] Culture[edit] Paul Cézanne's The Bay of Marseille, Seen from L'Estaque Bastille Day military parade in Marseille, 2012 Marseille is a city that has its own unique culture and is proud of its differences from the rest of France.[42] Today it is a regional centre for culture and entertainment with an important opera house, historical and maritime museums, five art galleries and numerous cinemas, clubs, bars and restaurants. Marseille has a large number of theatres, including La Criée, Le Gymnase and the Théâtre Toursky. There is also an extensive arts centre in La Friche, a former match factory behind the Saint-Charles station. The Alcazar, until the 1960s a well known music hall and variety theatre, has recently been completely remodelled behind its original façade and now houses the central municipal library.[43] Other music venues in Marseille include Le Silo (also a theatre) and GRIM. Marseille has also been important in the arts. It has been the birthplace and home of many French writers and poets, including Victor Gélu [fr], Valère Bernard, Pierre Bertas,[44] Edmond Rostand and André Roussin. The small port of l'Estaque on the far end of the Bay of Marseille became a favourite haunt for artists, including Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne (who frequently visited from his home in Aix), Georges Braque and Raoul Dufy. Multi-cultural influences[edit] Rich and poor neighborhoods exist side by side. Although the city is not without crime, Marseille has a larger degree of multicultural tolerance. Urban geographers[45] say the city's geography, being surrounded by mountains, helps explain why Marseille does not have the same problems as Paris. In Paris, ethnic areas are segregated and concentrated in the periphery of the city. Residents of Marseille are of diverse origins, yet appear to share a similar particular identity.[46][47] An example is how Marseille responded in 2005, when ethnic populations living in other French cities' suburbs rioted, but Marseille remained relatively calm.[48] Marseille served as the European Capital of Culture for 2013 along with Košice.[49] It was chosen to give a 'human face' to the European Union to celebrate cultural diversity and to increase understanding between Europeans.[50] One of the intentions of highlighting culture is to help reposition Marseille internationally, stimulate the economy, and help to build better interconnection between groups.[51] Marseille-Provence 2013 (MP2013) featured more than 900 cultural events held throughout Marseille and the surrounding communities. These cultural events generated more than 11 million visits.[52] The European Capital of Culture was also the occasion to unveil more than 600 million euros in new cultural infrastructure in Marseille and its environs, including the MuCEM designed by Rudy Ricciotti. Early on, immigrants came to Marseille locally from the surrounding Provence region. By the 1890s immigrants came from other regions of France as well as Italy.[53] Marseille became one of Europe's busiest port by 1900.[47] Marseille has served as a major port where immigrants from around the Mediterranean arrive.[53] Marseille continued to be multicultural. Armenians from the Ottoman Empire began arriving in 1913. In the 1930s, Italians settled in Marseille. After World War II, a wave of Jewish immigrants from North Africa arrived. In 1962, a number of French colonies gained their independence, and the French citizens from Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia arrived in Marseille.[54] The city had an economic downturn and lost many jobs. Those who could afford to move left and the poorest remained. For a while, the mafia appeared to run the city, and for a period of time the communist party was prominent.[54] Multi-cultural Marseille can be observed by a visitor at the market at Noailles, also called Marché des Capucins, in old town near the Old Port. There, Lebanese bakeries, an African spice market, Chinese and Vietnamese groceries, fresh vegetables and fruit, shops selling couscous, shops selling Caribbean food are side by side with stalls selling shoes and clothing from around the Mediterranean. Nearby, people sell fresh fish and men from Tunisia drink tea.[54] Although most Armenians arrived after the Armenian Genocide, Armenians had a long presence even before the 20th and late 19th centuries. Armenians, having an extensive trade network worldwide, massively traded with Marseille and its port. Most notably, during the 16th century, and after the Armenians gained a monopoly over Iranian silk, which was granted to them by Shah Abbas of Iran, the trade flow of Armenians of Marseille increased tremendously.[55] Merchants of Armenian origin received trade privileges in France by Armand Jean du Plessis de Richelieu (1585–1642) and later on Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619–1683) Marseille a free port in 1669. One notable Armenian-Iranian merchant gained a patent from Louis XIV (1638–1715) over Iranian silk.[56] Armenians also became successful money-lenders and bankers in the city. Due to these policies and the multiculturalism of the city of Marseille, Armenians became very wealthy, and the legacy of the Armenians in the city still lives on. Tarot de Marseille[edit] Marseille tarot card The most commonly used tarot deck takes its name from the city; it has been called the Tarot de Marseille since the 1930s—a name coined for commercial use by the French cardmaker and cartomancer Paul Marteau, owner of B–P Grimaud. Previously this deck was called Tarot italien (Italian Tarot) and even earlier it was simply called Tarot. Before being de Marseille, it was used to play the local variant of tarocchi before it became used in cartomancy at the end of the 18th century, following the trend set by Antoine Court de Gébelin. The name Tarot de Marseille (Marteau used the name ancien Tarot de Marseille) was used by contrast to other types of Tarots such as Tarot de Besançon; those names were simply associated with cities where there were many cardmakers in the 18th century (previously several cities in France were involved in cardmaking).[57] Another local tradition is the making of santons, small hand-crafted figurines for the traditional Provençal Christmas creche. Since 1803, starting on the last Sunday of November, there has been a Santon Fair in Marseille; it is currently held in the Cours d'Estienne d'Orves, a large square off the Vieux-Port. Opera[edit] The Opéra de Marseille Marseille's main cultural attraction was, since its creation at the end of the 18th century and until the late 1970s, the Opéra. Located near the Old Port and the Canebière, at the very heart of the city, its architectural style was comparable to the classical trend found in other opera houses built at the same time in Lyon and Bordeaux. In 1919, a fire almost completely destroyed the house, leaving only the stone colonnade and peristyle from the original façade.[58][59] The classical façade was restored and the opera house reconstructed in a predominantly Art Deco style, as the result of a major competition. Currently the Opéra de Marseille stages six or seven operas each year.[60] Since 1972, the Ballet national de Marseille has performed at the opera house; its director from its foundation to 1998 was Roland Petit. Popular events and festivals[edit] There are several popular festivals in different neighborhoods, with concerts, animations, and outdoor bars, like the Fête du Panier in June. On 21 June, there are dozens of free concerts in the city as part of France's Fête de la Musique, featuring music from all over the world. Being free events, many Marseille residents attend. Marseille hosts a Gay Pride event in early July. In 2013, Marseille hosted Europride, an international LGBT event, 10 July–20.[61] At the beginning of July, there is the International Documentary Festival.[62] At the end of September, the electronic music festival Marsatac takes place. In October, the Fiesta des Suds offers many concerts of world music.[63] Hip hop music[edit] Marseille is also well known in France for its hip hop music.[64] Bands like IAM originated from Marseille. Other known groups include Fonky Family, Psy 4 de la Rime (including rappers Soprano and Alonzo), and Keny Arkana. In a slightly different way, ragga music is represented by Massilia Sound System. Food[edit] Traditional Marseille bouillabaisse Swordfish in olive oil with ratatouille and saffron rice Pieds paquets Bouillabaisse is the most famous seafood dish of Marseille. It is a fish stew containing at least three varieties of very fresh local fish: typically red rascasse (Scorpaena scrofa); sea robin (fr: grondin); and European conger (fr: congre).[65] It can include gilt-head bream (fr: dorade); turbot; monkfish (fr: lotte or baudroie); mullet; or silver hake (fr: merlan), and it usually includes shellfish and other seafood such as sea urchins (fr: oursins), mussels (fr: moules); velvet crabs (fr: étrilles); spider crab (fr: araignées de mer), plus potatoes and vegetables. In the traditional version, the fish is served on a platter separate from the broth.[66] The broth is served with rouille, a mayonnaise made with egg yolk, olive oil, red bell pepper, saffron, and garlic, spread on pieces of toasted bread, or croûtons.[67][68] In Marseille, bouillabaisse is rarely made for fewer than ten people; the more people who share the meal, and the more different fish that are included, the better the bouillabaisse.[69] Aïoli is a sauce made from raw garlic, lemon juice, eggs and olive oil, served with boiled fish, hard boiled eggs and cooked vegetables.[67] Anchoïade [fr] is a paste made from anchovies, garlic, and olive oil, spread on bread or served with raw vegetables.[67] Bourride is a soup made with white fish (monkfish, European sea bass, whiting, etc.) and aïoli.[70] Fougasse is a flat Provençal bread, similar to the Italian focaccia. It is traditionally baked in a wood oven and sometimes filled with olives, cheese or anchovies.[citation needed] Navette de Marseille [fr] are, in the words of food writer M. F. K. Fisher, ""little boat-shaped cookies, tough dough tasting vaguely of orange peel, smelling better than they are.""[71] Farinata#French variations is chickpea flour boiled into a thick mush, allowed to firm up, then cut into blocks and fried.[72] Pastis is an alcoholic beverage made with aniseed and spice. It is extremely popular in the region.[73] Pieds paquets is a dish prepared from sheep's feet and offal.[70] Pistou is a combination of crushed fresh basil and garlic with olive oil, similar to the Italian pesto. The ""soupe au pistou"" combines pistou in a broth with pasta and vegetables.[67] Tapenade is a paste made from chopped olives, capers, and olive oil (sometimes anchovies may be added).[74] Films set in Marseille[edit] Main article: List of films set in Marseille Marseille has been the setting for many films. Main sights[edit] Marseille is listed as a major centre of art and history. The city has many museums and galleries and there are many ancient buildings and churches of historical interest.

Marseille is also home to the headquarters of the IRD, which promotes research into questions affecting developing countries.[citation needed] Transport[edit] Motorways around Marseille International and regional transport[edit] Marseille Provence Airport, the fifth busiest in France. The city is served by an international airport, Marseille Provence Airport, located in Marignane. The airport is the fifth busiest French airport, and known the 4th most important European traffic growth in 2012.[93] An extensive network of motorways connects Marseille to the north and west (A7), Aix-en-Provence in the north (A51), Toulon (A50) and the French Riviera (A8) to the east. Gare de Marseille Saint-Charles is Marseille's main railway station. It operates direct regional services to Aix-en-Provence, Briançon, Toulon, Avignon, Nice, Montpellier, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Nantes, etc. Gare Saint-Charles is also one of the main terminal stations for the TGV in the south of France making Marseille reachable in three hours from Paris (a distance of over 750 km) and just over one and a half hours from Lyon. There are also direct TGV lines to Lille, Brussels, Nantes, Geneva, Strasbourg and Frankfurt as well as Eurostar services to London (just in the summer) and Thello services to Milan (just one a day), via Nice and Genoa. There is a new long-distance bus station adjacent to new modern extension to the Gare Saint-Charles with destinations mostly to other Bouches-du-Rhône towns, including buses to Aix-en-Provence, Cassis, La Ciotat and Aubagne. The city is also served with 11 other regional trains stations in the east and the north of the city. Marseille has a large ferry terminal, the Gare Maritime, with services to Corsica, Sardinia, Algeria and Tunisia. Public transport[edit] See also: Transportation in Marseille Metro and tramway network Marseille is connected by the Marseille Métro train system operated by the Régie des transports de Marseille (RTM). It consists of two lines: Line 1 (blue) between Castellane and La Rose opened in 1977 and Line 2 (red) between Sainte-Marguerite-Dromel and Bougainville opened between 1984 and 1987. An extension of the Line 1 from Castellane to La Timone was completed in 1992, another extension from La Timone to La Fourragère (2.5 km (1.6 mi) and 4 new stations) was opened in May 2010. The Métro system operates on a turnstile system, with tickets purchased at the nearby adjacent automated booths. Both lines of the Métro intersect at Gare Saint-Charles and Castellane. Three bus rapid transit lines are under construction to better connect the Métro to farther places (Castellane -> Luminy; Capitaine Gèze – La Cabucelle -> Vallon des Tuves; La Rose -> Château Gombert – Saint Jérome). The new tramway An extensive bus network serves the city and suburbs of Marseille, with 104 lines and 633 buses. The three lines of the tramway,[94] opened in 2007, go from the CMA CGM Tower towards Les Caillols. As in many other French cities, a bike-sharing service nicknamed ""Le vélo"", free for trips of less than half an hour, was introduced by the city council in 2007.[95] A free ferry service operates between the two opposite quays of the Old Port. From 2011 ferry shuttle services operate between the Old Port and Pointe Rouge; in spring 2013 it will also run to l'Estaque.[96] There are also ferry services and boat trips available from the Old Port to Frioul, the Calanques and Cassis.

Match Race France 2008 Sailing is a major sport in Marseille. The wind conditions allow regattas in the warm waters of the Mediterranean.[citation needed] Throughout most seasons of the year it can be windy while the sea remains smooth enough to allow sailing. Marseille has been the host of 8 (2010) Match Race France events which are part of the World Match Racing Tour. The event draws the world's best sailing teams to Marseille. The identical supplied boats (J Boats J-80 racing yachts) are raced two at a time in an on the water dogfight which tests the sailors and skippers to the limits of their physical abilities. Points accrued count towards the World Match Racing Tour and a place in the final event, with the overall winner taking the title ISAF World Match Racing Tour Champion. Match racing is an ideal sport for spectators in Marseille, as racing in close proximity to the shore provides excellent views. The city was also considered as a possible venue for 2007 America's Cup.[98] Marseille is also a place for other water sports such as windsurfing and powerboating. Marseille has three golf courses. The city has dozens of gyms and several public swimming pools. Running is also popular in many of Marseille's parks such as Le Pharo and Le Jardin Pierre Puget. An annual footrace is held between the city and neighbouring Cassis: the Marseille-Cassis Classique Internationale.[citation needed] Climate[edit] The city has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa) with cool-mild winters with moderate rainfall, because of the wet westerly winds, and hot, mostly dry summers, due to the dry winds blowing from the Sahara desert at that period.[99] December, January, and February are the coldest months, averaging temperatures of around 12 °C (54 °F) during the day and 4 °C (39 °F) at night. July and August are the hottest months, averaging temperatures of around 28–30 °C (82–86 °F) during the day and 19 °C (66 °F) at night in the Marignane airport (35 km (22 mi) from Marseille) but in the city near the sea the average high temperature is 27 °C (81 °F) in July.[100] Marseille is officially the sunniest major city in France with over 2,800 hours of sunshine while the average sunshine in the country is around 1,950 hours. It is also the driest major city with only 512 mm (20 in) of precipitation annually, especially thanks to the Mistral, a cold, dry wind originating in the Rhône Valley that occurs mostly in winter and spring and which generally brings clear skies and sunny weather to the region. Less frequent is the Sirocco, a hot, sand-bearing wind, coming from the Sahara Desert. Snowfalls are infrequent; over 50% of years do not experience a single snowfall.[citation needed] The hottest temperature was 40.6 °C (105.1 °F) on 26 July 1983 during a great heat wave, the lowest temperature was −16.8 °C (1.8 °F) on 13 February 1929 during a strong cold wave.[101] Climate data for Marseille-Marignane (Marseille Provence Airport), elevation: 36 m, 1981–2010 normals, extremes

Official logo of the French Republic France (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ), officially the French Republic (French: République française),[1] is a transcontinental country spanning Western Europe and several overseas regions and territories.[XIII] Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea; overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. France borders Belgium, Luxembourg, and Germany to the northeast, Switzerland, Monaco and Italy to the east, Andorra and Spain to the south, as well as the Netherlands, Suriname, and Brazil in the Americas. Its eighteen integral regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi) and over 67 million people (as of May 2021[update]).[12] France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban areas include Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Lille, and Nice. Including its overseas territories, France has twelve time zones, the most of any country. Inhabited since the Palaeolithic era, France was settled by Celtic tribes known as Gauls during the Iron Age. Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture that laid the foundation of the French language. The Germanic Franks arrived in 476 and formed the Kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia becoming the Kingdom of France in 987. In the High Middle Ages, France was a highly decentralized feudal kingdom, but among the most powerful states in Europe. A distinct French identity began to emerge in the 14th and 15th centuries during the Hundred Years' War. The French Renaissance saw a flowering of art and culture, disputes with rivals Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, and the establishment of global colonial empire, which by the 20th century would become the second largest in the world.[13] Severely weakened by the Thirty Years' War and religious civil wars of the 17th century, under Louis XIV France reemerged as the dominant cultural, political, and military power by the early 18th century.[14] The costly Seven Years' War and involvement in the American Revolution precipitated the French Revolution of 1789, which overthrew the absolute monarchy, replaced the Ancien Régime with one of the first modern republics, and saw the drafting of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating much of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars shaped the course of European and world history. The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured a tumultuous succession of governments until the founding of the French Third Republic in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War. Subsequent decades saw a period of optimism, cultural and scientific flourishing, and economic prosperity known as the Belle Époque. France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious, and among the Allied powers in World War II, but came under occupation by the Axis in 1940. Following liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War. The Fifth Republic, led by Charles de Gaulle, was formed in 1958 and remains to this day. Algeria and nearly all other French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with most retaining close economic and military connections with France. France retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science, and philosophy. It hosts the world's fifth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the leading tourist destination, receiving over 89 million foreign visitors in 2018.[15] France is a developed country with the world's seventh-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the ninth-largest by PPP; in terms of aggregate household wealth, it ranks fourth in the world.[16] France performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, and human development.[17][18] It remains a great power in global affairs,[19] being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state. France is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the Eurozone,[20] additionally a member of the Group of 7, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and La Francophonie.

The name of the Franks is related to the English word frank (""free""): the latter stems from the Old French franc (""free, noble, sincere""), ultimately from Medieval Latin francus (""free, exempt from service; freeman, Frank""), a generalization of the tribal name that emerged as a Late Latin borrowing of the reconstructed Frankish endonym *Frank.[22][23] It has been suggested that the meaning ""free"" was adopted because, after the conquest of Gaul, only Franks were free of taxation,[24] or more generally because they had the status of freemen in contrast to servants or slaves.[23] The etymology of *Frank is uncertain. It is traditionally derived from the Proto-Germanic word *frankōn, which translates as ""javelin"" or ""lance"" (the throwing axe of the Franks was known as the francisca),[25] although these weapons may have been named because of their use by the Franks, not the other way around.[23] In English, 'France' is pronounced /fræns/ FRANSS in American English and /frɑːns/ FRAHNSS or /fræns/ FRANSS in British English. The pronunciation with /ɑː/ is mostly confined to accents with the trap-bath split such as Received Pronunciation, though it can be also heard in some other dialects such as Cardiff English, in which /frɑːns/ is in free variation with /fræns/.[26][27] History Main article: History of France Prehistory (before the 6th century BC) Main article: Prehistory of France One of the Lascaux paintings: a horse – approximately 17,000 BC. Lascaux is famous for its ""exceptionally detailed depictions of humans and animals"".[28] The oldest traces of human life in what is now France date from approximately 1.8 million years ago.[29] Over the ensuing millennia, humans were confronted by a harsh and variable climate, marked by several glacial periods. Early hominids led a nomadic hunter-gatherer life.[29] France has a large number of decorated caves from the upper Palaeolithic era, including one of the most famous and best preserved, Lascaux[29] (approximately 18,000 BC). At the end of the last glacial period (10,000 BC), the climate became milder;[29] from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of Western Europe entered the Neolithic era and its inhabitants became sedentary. After strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia, metallurgy appeared at the end of the 3rd millennium, initially working gold, copper and bronze, as well as later iron.[30] France has numerous megalithic sites from the Neolithic period, including the exceptionally dense Carnac stones site (approximately 3,300 BC). Antiquity (6th century BC–5th century AD) Main articles: Gaul, Celts, and Roman Gaul Vercingetorix surrenders to Caesar during the Battle of Alesia. The Gallic defeat in the Gallic Wars secured the Roman conquest of the country. In 600 BC, Ionian Greeks from Phocaea founded the colony of Massalia (present-day Marseille), on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. This makes it France's oldest city.[31][32] At the same time, some Gallic Celtic tribes penetrated parts of Eastern and Northern France, gradually spreading through the rest of the country between the 5th and 3rd century BC.[33] The concept of Gaul emerged during this period, corresponding to the territories of Celtic settlement ranging between the Rhine, the Atlantic Ocean, the Pyrenees and the Mediterranean. The borders of modern France roughly correspond to ancient Gaul, which was inhabited by Celtic Gauls. Gaul was then a prosperous country, of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to Greek and Roman cultural and economic influences. The Maison Carrée was a temple of the Gallo-Roman city of Nemausus (present-day Nîmes) and is one of the best-preserved vestiges of the Roman Empire. Around 390 BC, the Gallic chieftain Brennus and his troops made their way to Italy through the Alps, defeated the Romans in the Battle of the Allia, and besieged and ransomed Rome.[34] The Gallic invasion left Rome weakened, and the Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC when they entered into a formal peace treaty with Rome.[35] But the Romans and the Gauls would remain adversaries for the next centuries, and the Gauls would continue to be a threat in Italy.[36] Around 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region Provincia Nostra (""Our Province""), which over time evolved into the name Provence in French.[37] Julius Caesar conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix in 52 BC.[38] According to Plutarch and the writings of scholar Brendan Woods, the Gallic Wars resulted in 800 conquered cities, 300 subdued tribes, one million men sold into slavery, and another three million dead in battle.[citation needed] Gaul was divided by Augustus into Roman provinces.[39] Many cities were founded during the Gallo-Roman period, including Lugdunum (present-day Lyon), which is considered the capital of the Gauls.[39] These cities were built in traditional Roman style, with a forum, a theatre, a circus, an amphitheatre and thermal baths. The Gauls mixed with Roman settlers and eventually adopted Roman culture and Roman speech (Latin, from which the French language evolved). The Roman polytheism merged with the Gallic paganism into the same syncretism. From the 250s to the 280s AD, Roman Gaul suffered a serious crisis with its fortified borders being attacked on several occasions by barbarians.[40] Nevertheless, the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, which was a period of revival and prosperity for Roman Gaul.[41] In 312, Emperor Constantine I converted to Christianity. Subsequently, Christians, who had been persecuted until then, increased rapidly across the entire Roman Empire.[42] But, from the beginning of the 5th century, the Barbarian Invasions resumed.[43] Teutonic tribes invaded the region from present-day Germany, the Visigoths settling in the southwest, the Burgundians along the Rhine River Valley, and the Franks (from whom the French take their name) in the north.[44] Early Middle Ages (5th–10th century) Main articles: Francia, Merovingian dynasty, and Carolingian dynasty See also: List of French monarchs and France in the Middle Ages Frankish expansion from 481 to 870 At the end of the Antiquity period, ancient Gaul was divided into several Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory, known as the Kingdom of Syagrius. Simultaneously, Celtic Britons, fleeing the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, settled the western part of Armorica. As a result, the Armorican peninsula was renamed Brittany, Celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region. The first leader to make himself king of all the Franks was Clovis I, who began his reign in 481, routing the last forces of the Roman governors of the province in 486. Clovis claimed that he would be baptized a Christian in the event of his victory against the Visigoths, which was said to have guaranteed the battle. Clovis regained the southwest from the Visigoths, was baptized in 508, and made himself master of what is now western Germany. Clovis I was the first Germanic conqueror after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity, rather than Arianism; thus France was given the title ""Eldest daughter of the Church"" (French: La fille aînée de l'Église) by the papacy,[45] and French kings would be called ""the Most Christian Kings of France"" (Rex Christianissimus). With Clovis's conversion to Catholicism in 498, the Frankish monarchy, elective and secular until then, became hereditary and of divine right. The Franks embraced the Christian Gallo-Roman culture and ancient Gaul was eventually renamed Francia (""Land of the Franks""). The Germanic Franks adopted Romanic languages, except in northern Gaul where Roman settlements were less dense and where Germanic languages emerged. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian dynasty, but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from Clovis's: Paris, Orléans, Soissons, and Rheims. The last Merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace (head of household). One mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated an Islamic invasion of Gaul at the Battle of Tours (732) and earned respect and power within the Frankish kingdoms. His son, Pepin the Short, seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the Carolingian dynasty. Pepin's son, Charlemagne, reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across Western and Central Europe. Proclaimed Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III and thus establishing in earnest the French Government's longtime historical association with the Catholic Church,[46] Charlemagne tried to revive the Western Roman Empire and its cultural grandeur. Charlemagne's son, Louis I (Emperor 814–840), kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive his death. In 843, under the Treaty of Verdun, the empire was divided between Louis' three sons, with East Francia going to Louis the German, Middle Francia to Lothair I, and West Francia to Charles the Bald. West Francia approximated the area occupied by, and was the precursor to, modern France.[47] During the 9th and 10th centuries, continually threatened by Viking invasions, France became a very decentralized state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen. Thus was established feudalism in France. Over time, some of the king's vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king. For example, after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror added ""King of England"" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of Normandy) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France, creating recurring tensions. High and Late Middle Ages (10th–15th century) Main articles: Kingdom of France, Capetian dynasty, Valois dynasty, and Bourbon dynasty See also: List of French monarchs and France in the Middle Ages Joan of Arc led the French army to several important victories during the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453), which paved the way for the final victory. Metropolitan France territorial evolution from 985 to 1947 The Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when Hugh Capet, Duke of France and Count of Paris, was crowned King of the Franks.[48] His descendants—the Capetians, the House of Valois and the House of Bourbon—progressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance into the Kingdom of France, which was fully declared in 1190 by Philip II of France (Philippe Auguste). Later kings would expand their directly possessed domaine royal to cover over half of modern continental France by the 15th century, including most of the north, centre and west of France. During this process, the royal authority became more and more assertive, centered on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility, clergy, and commoners. The French nobility played a prominent role in most Crusades to restore Christian access to the Holy Land. French knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the two-hundred-year span of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as Franj caring little whether they really came from France.[49] The French Crusaders also imported the French language into the Levant, making French the base of the lingua franca (litt. ""Frankish language"") of the Crusader states.[49] French knights also made up the majority in both the Hospital and the Temple orders. The latter, in particular, held numerous properties throughout France and by the 13th century were the principal bankers for the French crown, until Philip IV annihilated the order in 1307. The Albigensian Crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical Cathars in the southwestern area of modern-day France. In the end, the Cathars were exterminated and the autonomous County of Toulouse was annexed into the crown lands of France.[50] From the 11th century, the House of Plantagenet, the rulers of the County of Anjou, succeeded in establishing its dominion over the surrounding provinces of Maine and Touraine, then progressively built an ""empire"" that spanned from England to the Pyrenees and covering half of modern France. Tensions between the kingdom of France and the Plantagenet empire would last a hundred years, until Philip II of France conquered, between 1202 and 1214 most of the continental possessions of the empire, leaving England and Aquitaine to the Plantagenets. Following the Battle of Bouvines. Charles IV the Fair died without an heir in 1328.[51] Under the rules of the Salic law the crown of France could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line.[51] Accordingly, the crown passed to Philip of Valois, rather than through the female line to Edward of Plantagenet, who would soon become Edward III of England. During the reign of Philip of Valois, the French monarchy reached the height of its medieval power.[51] However Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward III of England in 1337, and England and France entered the off-and-on Hundred Years' War.[52] The exact boundaries changed greatly with time, but landholdings inside France by the English Kings remained extensive for decades. With charismatic leaders, such as Joan of Arc and La Hire, strong French counterattacks won back most English continental territories. Like the rest of Europe, France was struck by the Black Death; half of the 17 million population of France died.[53][54] Early modern period (15th century–1789) Main articles: French Renaissance, Early modern France, and Ancien Régime The Château de Chenonceau, nowadays part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was built in the early 16th century. The French Renaissance saw a spectacular cultural development and the first standardisation of the French language, which would become the official language of France and the language of Europe's aristocracy. It also saw a long set of wars, known as the Italian Wars, between France and the House of Habsburg. French explorers, such as Jacques Cartier or Samuel de Champlain, claimed lands in the Americas for France, paving the way for the expansion of the First French colonial empire. The rise of Protestantism in Europe led France to a civil war known as the French Wars of Religion, where, in the most notorious incident, thousands of Huguenots were murdered in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572.[55] The Wars of Religion were ended by Henry IV's Edict of Nantes, which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots. Spanish troops, the terror of Western Europe,[56] assisted the Catholic side during the Wars of Religion in 1589–1594, and invaded northern France in 1597; after some skirmishing in the 1620s and 1630s, Spain and France returned to all-out war between 1635 and 1659. The war cost France 300,000 casualties.[57] Under Louis XIII, the energetic Cardinal Richelieu promoted the centralisation of the state and reinforced the royal power by disarming domestic power holders in the 1620s. He systematically destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private violence (dueling, carrying weapons and maintaining private armies). By the end of the 1620s, Richelieu established ""the royal monopoly of force"" as the doctrine.[58] During Louis XIV's minority and the regency of Queen Anne and Cardinal Mazarin, a period of trouble known as the Fronde occurred in France. This rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal absolute power in France. Louis XIV, the ""sun king"" was the absolute monarch of France and made France the leading European power. The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV (1643–1715). By turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the Palace of Versailles, Louis XIV's personal power became unchallenged. Remembered for his numerous wars, he made France the leading European power. France became the most populous country in Europe and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the 20th century.[59] France obtained many overseas possessions in the Americas, Africa and Asia. Louis XIV also revoked the Edict of Nantes, forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile. Under the wars of Louis XV (r. 1715–1774), France lost New France and most of its Indian possessions after its defeat in the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). Its European territory kept growing, however, with notable acquisitions such as Lorraine (1766) and Corsica (1770). An unpopular king, Louis XV's weak rule, his ill-advised financial, political and military decisions – as well as the debauchery of his court– discredited the monarchy, which arguably paved the way for the French Revolution 15 years after his death.[60][61] Louis XVI (r. 1774–1793), actively supported the Americans with money, fleets and armies, helping them win independence from Great Britain. France gained revenge but spent so heavily that the government verged on bankruptcy--a factor that contributed to the French Revolution. Much of the Enlightenment occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the discovery of oxygen (1778) and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers (1783), were achieved by French scientists. French explorers, such as Bougainville and Lapérouse, took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe. The Enlightenment philosophy, in which reason is advocated as the primary source for legitimacy, undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and also was a factor in the French Revolution. Revolutionary France (1789–1799) Main articles: History of France § Revolutionary France (1789–1799), and French Revolution Ouverture des États généraux à Versailles, 5 mai 1789 by Auguste Couder The Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 was the most emblematic event of the French Revolution. Facing financial troubles, King Louis XVI summoned the Estates-General (gathering the three Estates of the realm) in May 1789 to propose solutions to his government. As it came to an impasse, the representatives of the Third Estate formed into a National Assembly, signalling the outbreak of the French Revolution. Fearing that the king would suppress the newly created National Assembly, insurgents stormed the Bastille on 14 July 1789, a date which would become France's National Day. In early August 1789, the National Constituent Assembly abolished the privileges of the nobility such as personal serfdom and exclusive hunting rights. Through the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (27 August 1789) France established fundamental rights for men. The Declaration affirms ""the natural and imprescriptible rights of man"" to ""liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression"". Freedom of speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests outlawed. It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men, as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth. In November 1789, the Assembly decided to nationalise and sell all property of the Catholic Church which had been the largest landowner in the country. In July 1790, a Civil Constitution of the Clergy reorganized the French Catholic Church, cancelling the authority of the Church to levy taxes, et cetera. This fueled much discontent in parts of France, which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some years later. While King Louis XVI still enjoyed popularity among the population, his disastrous flight to Varennes (June 1791) seemed to justify rumors he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion. His credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility. In August 1791, the Emperor of Austria and the King of Prussia in the Declaration of Pillnitz threatened revolutionary France to intervene by force of arms to restore the French absolute monarchy. In September 1791, the National Constituent Assembly forced King Louis XVI to accept the French Constitution of 1791, thus turning the French absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy. In the newly established Legislative Assembly (October 1791), enmity developed and deepened between a group, later called the 'Girondins', who favored war with Austria and Prussia, and a group later called 'Montagnards' or 'Jacobins', who opposed such a war. A majority in the Assembly in 1792 however saw a war with Austria and Prussia as a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government, and thought that France would win a war against those gathered monarchies. On 20 April 1792, therefore, they declared war on Austria. Le Serment du Jeu de paume by Jacques-Louis David, 1791 On 10 August 1792, an angry crowd threatened the palace of King Louis XVI, who took refuge in the Legislative Assembly.[62][63] A Prussian Army invaded France later in August 1792. In early September, Parisians, infuriated by the Prussian Army capturing Verdun and counter-revolutionary uprisings in the west of France, murdered between 1,000 and 1,500 prisoners by raiding the Parisian prisons. The Assembly and the Paris City Council seemed unable to stop that bloodshed.[62][64] The National Convention, chosen in the first elections under male universal suffrage,[62] on 20 September 1792 succeeded the Legislative Assembly and on 21 September abolished the monarchy by proclaiming the French First Republic. Ex-King Louis XVI was convicted of treason and guillotined in January 1793. France had declared war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic in November 1792 and did the same on Spain in March 1793; in the spring of 1793, Austria and Prussia invaded France; in March, France created a ""sister republic"" in the ""Republic of Mainz"", and kept it under control. Also in March 1793, the civil war of the Vendée against Paris started, evoked by both the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 1790 and the nationwide army conscription early 1793; elsewhere in France rebellion was brewing too. A factionalist feud in the National Convention, smoldering ever since October 1791, came to a climax with the group of the 'Girondins' on 2 June 1793 being forced to resign and leave the convention. The counter-revolution, begun in March 1793 in the Vendée, by July had spread to Brittany, Normandy, Bordeaux, Marseilles, Toulon, and Lyon. Paris' Convention government between October and December 1793 with brutal measures managed to subdue most internal uprisings, at the cost of tens of thousands of lives. Some historians consider the civil war to have lasted until 1796 with a toll of possibly 450,000 lives.[65][66] By the end of 1793 the allies had been driven from France. France in February 1794 abolished slavery in its American colonies, but would reintroduce it later. Political disagreements and enmity in the National Convention between October 1793 and July 1794 reached unprecedented levels, leading to dozens of Convention members being sentenced to death and guillotined. Meanwhile, France's external wars in 1794 were going prosperous, for example in Belgium. In 1795, the government seemed to return to indifference towards the desires and needs of the lower classes concerning freedom of (Catholic) religion and fair distribution of food. Until 1799, politicians, apart from inventing a new parliamentary system (the 'Directory'), busied themselves with dissuading the people from Catholicism and from royalism. Napoleon and 19th century (1799–1914) Main articles: History of France § Napoleonic France (1799–1815); History of France § Long 19th century, 1815–1914; First French Empire; Second French Empire; and French colonial empire See also: France in the 19th century and France in the 20th century Napoleon, Emperor of the French, built a vast empire across Europe. His conquests spread the ideals of the French Revolution across much of the continent, such as popular sovereignty, equality before the law, republicanism and administrative reorganisation while his legal reforms had a major impact worldwide. Nationalism, especially in Germany, emerged in reaction against him.[67] Napoleon Bonaparte seized control of the Republic in 1799 becoming First Consul and later Emperor of the French Empire (1804–1814; 1815). As a continuation of the wars sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic, changing sets of European Coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's Empire. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the battles of Jena-Auerstadt or Austerlitz. Members of the Bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.[68] These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the metric system, the Napoleonic Code and the Declaration of the Rights of Man. In June 1812, Napoleon attacked Russia, reaching Moscow. Thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease, Russian attacks, and finally winter. After the catastrophic Russian campaign, and the ensuing uprising of European monarchies against his rule, Napoleon was defeated and the Bourbon monarchy restored. About a million Frenchmen died during the Napoleonic Wars.[68] After his brief return from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, the monarchy was re-established (1815–1830), with new constitutional limitations. The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the July Revolution of 1830, which established the constitutional July Monarchy. In that year, French troops conquered Algeria, establishing the first colonial presence in Africa since Napoleon's abortive invasion of Egypt in 1798. In 1848, general unrest led to the February Revolution and the end of the July Monarchy. The abolition of slavery and introduction of male universal suffrage, which were briefly enacted during the French Revolution, were re-enacted in 1848. In 1852, the president of the French Republic, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the Second Empire, as Napoleon III. He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially in Crimea, in Mexico and Italy which resulted in the annexation of the Duchy of Savoy and the County of Nice, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and his regime was replaced by the Third Republic. By 1875, the French conquest of Algeria was complete and approximately 825,000 Algerians were killed as a result.[69] Animated map of the growth and decline of the French colonial empire France had colonial possessions, in various forms, since the beginning of the 17th century, but in the 19th and 20th centuries, its global overseas colonial empire extended greatly and became the second largest in the world behind the British Empire. Including metropolitan France, the total area of land under French sovereignty almost reached 13 million square kilometers in the 1920s and 1930s, 8.6% of the world's land. Known as the Belle Époque, the turn of the century was a period characterised by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. In 1905, state secularism was officially established. Contemporary period (1914–present) Main article: History of France (1900 to present) French Poilus posing with their war-torn flag in 1917, during World War I France was invaded by Germany and defended by Great Britain to start World War I in August 1914. A rich industrial area in the northeast was occupied. France and the Allies emerged victorious against the Central Powers at a tremendous human and material cost. World War I left 1.4 million French soldiers dead, 4% of its population.[70] Between 27 and 30% of soldiers conscripted from 1912 to 1915 were killed.[71] The interbellum years were marked by intense international tensions and a variety of social reforms introduced by the Popular Front government (annual leave, eight-hour workdays, women in government). In 1940, France was invaded and quickly defeated by Nazi Germany. France was divided into a German occupation zone in the north, an Italian occupation zone in the southeast and an unoccupied territory, the rest of France, which consisted of the southern French metropolitan territory (two-fifths of pre-war metropolitan France) and the French empire, which included the two protectorates of French Tunisia and French Morocco, and French Algeria; the Vichy government, a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with Germany, ruled the unoccupied territory. Free France, the government-in-exile led by Charles de Gaulle, was set up in London.[72][full citation needed] From 1942 to 1944, about 160,000 French citizens, including around 75,000 Jews,[72][73][74] were deported to death camps and concentration camps in Germany and occupied Poland.[75] In September 1943, Corsica was the first French metropolitan territory to liberate itself from the Axis. On 6 June 1944, the Allies invaded Normandy and in August they invaded Provence. Over the following year the Allies and the French Resistance emerged victorious over the Axis powers and French sovereignty was restored with the establishment of the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF). This interim government, established by de Gaulle, aimed to continue to wage war against Germany and to purge collaborators from office. It also made several important reforms (suffrage extended to women, creation of a social security system). Charles de Gaulle took an active part in many major events of the 20th century: a hero of World War I, leader of the Free French during World War II, he then became President, where he facilitated decolonisation, maintained France as a major power and overcame the revolt of May 1968. The GPRF laid the groundwork for a new constitutional order that resulted in the Fourth Republic, which saw spectacular economic growth (les Trente Glorieuses). France was one of the founding members of NATO (1949). France attempted to regain control of French Indochina but was defeated by the Viet Minh in 1954 at the climactic Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Only months later, France faced another anti-colonialist conflict in Algeria. The systematic torture and repression, as well as the extrajudicial killings that were perpetrated to keep control of Algeria, then treated as an integral part of France and home to over one million European settlers,[76][77] wracked the country and nearly led to a coup and civil war.[78] In 1958, the weak and unstable Fourth Republic gave way to the Fifth Republic, which included a strengthened Presidency.[79] In the latter role, Charles de Gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the Algerian War. The war was concluded with the Évian Accords in 1962 that led to Algerian independence. The Algerian independence came at a high price: namely, the large toll on the Algerian population. It resulted in half million to a million deaths and over 2 million internally displaced Algerians.[80][81][82] A vestige of the colonial empire are the French overseas departments and territories. The May 68 protests, a massive social movement, would ultimately led to many social changes, such as the right to abortion, women empowerment as well as the decriminalisation of homosexuality.[83][84] In the context of the Cold War, De Gaulle pursued a policy of ""national independence"" towards the Western and Eastern blocs. To this end, he withdrew from NATO's military integrated command (while remaining in the NATO alliance itself), launched a nuclear development programme and made France the fourth nuclear power. He restored cordial Franco-German relations to create a European counterweight between the American and Soviet spheres of influence. However, he opposed any development of a supranational Europe, favouring a Europe of sovereign nations. In the wake of the series of worldwide protests of 1968, the revolt of May 1968 had an enormous social impact. In France, it was the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal (secularism, individualism, sexual revolution). Although the revolt was a political failure (as the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before) it announced a split between the French people and de Gaulle who resigned shortly after.[85] In the post-Gaullist era, France remained one of the most developed economies in the world, but faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries France has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational European Union, notably by signing the Maastricht Treaty (which created the European Union) in 1992, establishing the Eurozone in 1999 and signing the Lisbon Treaty in 2007.[86] France has also gradually but fully reintegrated into NATO and has since participated in most NATO sponsored wars.[87] Republican marches were organised across France after the January 2015 attacks perpetrated by Islamist terrorists; they became the largest public rallies in French history. Since the 19th century France has received many immigrants. These have been mostly male foreign workers from European Catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed.[88] During the 1970s France faced economic crisis and allowed new immigrants (mostly from the Maghreb)[88] to permanently settle in France with their families and to acquire French citizenship. It resulted in hundreds of thousands of Muslims (especially in the larger cities) living in subsidised public housing and suffering from very high unemployment rates.[89] Simultaneously France renounced the assimilation of immigrants, where they were expected to adhere to French traditional values and cultural norms. They were encouraged to retain their distinctive cultures and traditions and required merely to integrate.[90] Since the 1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings, France has been sporadically targeted by Islamist organisations, notably the Charlie Hebdo attack in January 2015 which provoked the largest public rallies in French history, gathering 4.4 million people,[91][92] the November 2015 Paris attacks which resulted in 130 deaths, the deadliest attack on French soil since World War II[93][94] and the deadliest in the European Union since the Madrid train bombings in 2004,[95] as well as the 2016 Nice truck attack, which caused 87 deaths during Bastille Day celebrations. Opération Chammal, France's military efforts to contain ISIS, killed over 1,000 ISIS troops between 2014 and 2015.[96][97] Geography Main article: Geography of France Location and borders A relief map of Metropolitan France, showing cities with over 100,000 inhabitants Mont Blanc, the highest summit in Western Europe, marks the border with Italy. The vast majority of France's territory and population is situated in Western Europe and is called Metropolitan France, to distinguish it from the country's various overseas polities. It is bordered by the North Sea in the north, the English Channel in the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean sea in the southeast. Its land borders consist of Belgium and Luxembourg in the northeast, Germany and Switzerland in the east, Italy and Monaco in the southeast, and Andorra and Spain in the south and southwest. With the exception of the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south and southeast, the Pyrenees and the Alps and the Jura, respectively, and to the east, the Rhine river. Due to its shape, France is often referred to as l'Hexagone (""The Hexagon""). Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is Corsica. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes 41° and 51° N, and longitudes 6° W and 10° E, on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern temperate zone. Its continental part covers about 1000 km from north to south and from east to west. France has several overseas regions across the world, which are organized as follows: In South America: French Guiana. In the Atlantic Ocean: Saint Pierre and Miquelon and, in the Antilles: Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy. In the Pacific Ocean: French Polynesia, the special collectivity of New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna and Clipperton Island. In the Indian Ocean: Réunion island, Mayotte, Kerguelen Islands, Crozet Islands, St. Paul and Amsterdam islands, and the Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean In the Antarctic: Adélie Land. France has land borders with Brazil and Suriname via French Guiana and with the Kingdom of the Netherlands through the French portion of Saint Martin. Metropolitan France covers 551,500 square kilometres (212,935 sq mi),[98] the largest among European Union members.[20] France's total land area, with its overseas departments and territories (excluding Adélie Land), is 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi), 0.45% of the total land area on Earth. France possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the Alps in the southeast, the Massif Central in the south central and Pyrenees in the southwest. Due to its numerous overseas departments and territories scattered across the planet, France possesses the second-largest Exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the world, covering 11,035,000 km2 (4,260,000 mi2), just behind the EEZ of the United States, which covers 11,351,000 km2 (4,383,000 mi2), but ahead of the EEZ of Australia, which covers 8,148,250 km2 (4,111,312 mi2). Its EEZ covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world. Geology, topography and hydrography Geological formations near Roussillon, Vaucluse Metropolitan France has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes. Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, during which the Armorican Massif, the Massif Central, the Morvan, the Vosges and Ardennes ranges and the island of Corsica were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north, the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of Beauce and Brie. Various routes of natural passage, such as the Rhône Valley, allow easy communications. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. At 4,810.45 metres (15,782 ft)[99] above sea level, Mont Blanc, located in the Alps on the French and Italian border, is the highest point in Western Europe. Although 60% of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks, these risks remain moderate. Reed bed on the Gironde estuary, the largest estuary in Western Europe The coastlines offer contrasting landscapes: mountain ranges along the French Riviera, coastal cliffs such as the Côte d'Albâtre, and wide sandy plains in the Languedoc. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast. France has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, the Rhône and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory. The Rhône divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Camargue. The Garonne meets the Dordogne just after Bordeaux, forming the Gironde estuary, the largest estuary in Western Europe which after approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) empties into the Atlantic Ocean.[100] Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the north-eastern borders. France has 11 million square kilometres (4.2×10^6 sq mi) of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97% are overseas.

This is due to the country's heavy investment in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis,[103] which now accounts for 75 percent of its electricity production[104] and results in less pollution.[105][106] According to the 2018 Environmental Performance Index conducted by Yale and Columbia, France was the second-most environmentally-conscious country in the world (after Switzerland), compared to tenth place in 2016 and 27th in 2014.[107][108] The forest of Rambouillet in Yvelines illustrates France's flora diversity. Like all European Union state members, France agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20% of 1990 levels by the year 2020,[109] compared to the United States plan to reduce emissions by 4% of 1990 levels.[110] As of 2009[update], French carbon dioxide emissions per capita were lower than that of China's.[111] The country was set to impose a carbon tax in 2009 at 17 euros per tonne of carbon emitted,[112] which would have raised 4 billion euros of revenue annually.[113] However, the plan was abandoned due to fears of burdening French businesses.[114] Calanques National Park in Bouches-du-Rhône is one of the best known protected areas of France. Forests account for 31 percent of France's land area—the fourth-highest proportion in Europe—representing an increase of 7 percent since 1990.[115][116][117] French forests are some of the most diverse in Europe, comprising more than 140 species of trees.[118] France had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.52/10, ranking it 123rd globally out of 172 countries.[119] There are nine national parks[120] and 46 natural parks in France,[121] with the government planning to convert 20% of its Exclusive economic zone into a Marine protected area by 2020.[122] A regional nature park[123] (French: parc naturel régional or PNR) is a public establishment in France between local authorities and the national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty, to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development in the area.[124] A PNR sets goals and guidelines for managed human habitation, sustainable economic development and protection of the natural environment based on each park's unique landscape and heritage. The parks foster ecological research programs and public education in the natural sciences.[125] As of 2019[update] there are 54 PNRs in France.[126] Administrative divisions Main article: Administrative divisions of France The French Republic is divided into 18 regions (located in Europe and overseas), five overseas collectivities, one overseas territory, one special collectivity – New Caledonia and one uninhabited island directly under the authority of the Minister of Overseas France – Clipperton. Regions Hauts-de-France Normandy Île-de-France Grand Est Bourgogne-Franche-Comté Centre-Val de Loire Pays de la Loire Brittany Nouvelle-Aquitaine Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Occitanie Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur Corsica French Guiana Guadeloupe Martinique Mayotte RéunionBelgium Luxembourg Germany Switzerland Italy United Kingdom Andorra Brazil Suriname SpainChannel Bay ofBiscay LigurianSea MediterraneanSea Since 2016, France is mainly divided into 18 administrative regions: 13 regions in metropolitan France (including the territorial collectivity of Corsica),[127] and five located overseas.[98] The regions are further subdivided into 101 departments,[128] which are numbered mainly alphabetically. This number is used in postal codes and was formerly used on vehicle number plates. Among the 101 departments of France, five (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Réunion) are in overseas regions (ROMs) that are also simultaneously overseas departments (DOMs), enjoy exactly the same status as metropolitan departments and are an integral part of the European Union. The 101 departments are subdivided into 335 arrondissements, which are, in turn, subdivided into 2,054 cantons.[129] These cantons are then divided into 36,658 communes, which are municipalities with an elected municipal council.[129] Three communes—Paris, Lyon and Marseille—are subdivided into 45 municipal arrondissements. The regions, departments and communes are all known as territorial collectivities, meaning they possess local assemblies as well as an executive. Arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions. However, this was not always the case. Until 1940, the arrondissements were territorial collectivities with an elected assembly, but these were suspended by the Vichy regime and definitely abolished by the Fourth Republic in 1946. Overseas territories and collectivities In addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments, the French Republic has five overseas collectivities (French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna), one sui generis collectivity (New Caledonia), one overseas territory (French Southern and Antarctic Lands), and one island possession in the Pacific Ocean (Clipperton Island). Overseas collectivities and territories form part of the French Republic, but do not form part of the European Union or its fiscal area (with the exception of St. Bartelemy, which seceded from Guadeloupe in 2007). The Pacific Collectivities (COMs) of French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia continue to use the CFP franc[130] whose value is strictly linked to that of the euro. In contrast, the five overseas regions used the French franc and now use the euro.[131] The lands making up the French Republic, shown at the same geographic scale Name Constitutional status Capital Clipperton Island State private property under the direct authority of the French government Uninhabited French Polynesia Designated as an overseas land (pays d'outre-mer or POM), the status is the same as an overseas collectivity.

Mata-Utu Politics Main article: Politics of France Government Emmanuel MacronPresident Jean CastexPrime minister The French Republic is a unitary semi-presidential representative democratic republic with strong democratic traditions.[132] The Constitution of the Fifth Republic was approved by referendum on 28 September 1958.[133] It greatly strengthened the authority of the executive in relation to Parliament. The executive branch itself has two leaders. The president of the Republic, currently Emmanuel Macron, is the head of state, elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a 5-year term (formerly 7 years).[134] The prime minister, currently Jean Castex, is the head of government, appointed by the president of the Republic to lead the Government of France. The National Assembly is the lower house of the French Parliament. The French Parliament is a bicameral legislature comprising a National Assembly (Assemblée nationale) and a Senate.[135] The National Assembly deputies represent local constituencies and are directly elected for 5-year terms.[136] The Assembly has the power to dismiss the government; thus the majority in the Assembly determines the choice of government. Senators are chosen by an electoral college for 6-year terms (originally 9-year terms); one half of the seats are submitted to election every 3 years.[137] The Senate's legislative powers are limited; in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say.[138] The Government has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of Parliament. Until World War II, Radicals were a strong political force in France, embodied by the Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party which was the most important party of the Third Republic. Since World War II, they were marginalized while French politics became characterized by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, centred on the French Section of the Workers' International and its successor the Socialist Party (since 1969); and the other right-wing, centred on the Gaullist Party, whose name changed over time to the Rally of the French People (1947), the Union of Democrats for the Republic (1958), the Rally for the Republic (1976), the Union for a Popular Movement (2007) and The Republicans (since 2015). In the 2017 presidential and legislative elections, radical centrist party En Marche! became the dominant force, overtaking both Socialists and Republicans. As of 2017, voter turnout was 75 percent during recent elections, higher than the OECD average of 68 percent.[139] Law Main article: Law of France France uses a civil legal system, wherein law arises primarily from written statutes;[98] judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law in a common law system). Basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the Napoleonic Code (which was, in turn, largely based on the royal law codified under Louis XIV). In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As Guy Canivet, first president of the Court of Cassation, wrote about the management of prisons: ""Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality."" That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy. The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. French law is divided into two principal areas: private law and public law. Private law includes, in particular, civil law and criminal law. Public law includes, in particular, administrative law and constitutional law. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law, and administrative law. Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminal ex post facto laws are prohibited).[140] While administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries, it is completely separated in France and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court: ordinary courts (which handle criminal and civil litigation) are headed by the Court of Cassation and administrative courts are headed by the Council of State. To be applicable, every law must be officially published in the Journal officiel de la République française. France does not recognise religious law as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions; it has long abolished blasphemy laws and sodomy laws (the latter in 1791). However, ""offences against public decency"" (contraires aux bonnes mœurs) or disturbing public order (trouble à l'ordre public) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution. Since 1999, civil unions for homosexual couples are permitted, and since 2013, same-sex marriage and LGBT adoption are legal.[141] Laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881. Some consider hate speech laws in France to be too broad or severe, undermining freedom of speech.[142] France has laws against racism and antisemitism,[143] while the 1990 Gayssot Act prohibits Holocaust denial. Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State is the basis for laïcité (state secularism): the state does not formally recognize any religion, except in Alsace-Moselle. Nonetheless, it does recognize religious associations. The Parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995, and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004. In 2010, it banned the wearing of face-covering Islamic veils in public; human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch described the law as discriminatory towards Muslims.[144][145] However, it is supported by most of the population.[146] Foreign relations Main article: Foreign relations of France 88 states and governments are part of La Francophonie,[147] which promotes values of democracy, multilingualism and cultural diversity.[148] France has been a key member of this global organization since its inception in 1970. France is a founding member of the United Nations and serves as one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council with veto rights.[149] In 2015, France was described as being ""the best networked state in the world"", because it is a country that ""is member of more multi-lateral organisations than any other country"".[150] France is a member of the G8, World Trade Organization (WTO),[151] the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC)[152] and the Indian Ocean Commission (COI).[153] It is an associate member of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS)[154] and a leading member of the International Francophone Organisation (OIF) of 84 fully or partly French-speaking countries.[155] As a significant hub for international relations, France hosts the second largest assembly of diplomatic missions in the world and the headquarters of international organisations including the OECD, UNESCO, Interpol, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and la Francophonie.[156] Postwar French foreign policy has been largely shaped by membership of the European Union, of which it was a founding member. Since the 1960s, France has developed close ties with reunified Germany to become the most influential driving force of the EU.[157] In the 1960s, France sought to exclude the British from the European unification process,[158] seeking to build its own standing in continental Europe. However, since 1904, France has maintained an ""Entente cordiale"" with the United Kingdom, and there has been a strengthening of links between the countries, especially militarily. The European Parliament in Strasbourg, near the border with (Germany). France is a founding member of all EU institutions. France is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), but under President de Gaulle, it excluded itself from the joint military command to protest the Special Relationship between the United States and Britain and to preserve the independence of French foreign and security policies. However, as a result of Nicolas Sarkozy's pro-American politics (much criticised in France by the leftists and by a part of the right), France re-joined the NATO joint military command on 4 April 2009.[159][160][161] In the early 1990s, the country drew considerable criticism from other nations for its underground nuclear tests in French Polynesia.[162] France vigorously opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq,[163][164] straining bilateral relations with the United States[165][166] and the United Kingdom. France retains strong political and economic influence in its former African colonies (Françafrique)[167] and has supplied economic aid and troops for peacekeeping missions in Ivory Coast and Chad.[168] Recently, after the unilateral declaration of independence of Northern Mali by the Tuareg MNLA and the subsequent regional Northern Mali conflict with several Islamist groups including Ansar Dine and MOJWA, France and other African states intervened to help the Malian Army to retake control. In 2017, France was the fourth-largest donor (in absolute terms) of development aid in the world, behind the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.[169] This represents 0.43% of its GNP, the 12th highest among the OECD.[170] The organisation managing the French help is the French Development Agency, which finances primarily humanitarian projects in sub-Saharan Africa.[171] The main goals of this support are ""developing infrastructure, access to health care and education, the implementation of appropriate economic policies and the consolidation of the rule of law and democracy"".[171] Military Main article: French Armed Forces Examples of France's military. Clockwise from top left: nuclear aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle; a Dassault Rafale fighter aircraft; French Chasseurs Alpins patrolling the valleys of Kapisa province in Afghanistan; a Leclerc tank The French Armed Forces (Forces armées françaises) are the military and paramilitary forces of France, under the President of the Republic as supreme commander. They consist of the French Army (Armée de Terre), French Navy (Marine Nationale, formerly called Armée de Mer), the French Air and Space Force (Armée de l'Air et de l’Espace), and the Military Police called National Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie nationale), which also fulfils civil police duties in the rural areas of France. Together they are among the largest armed forces in the world and the largest in the EU. According to a 2018 study by Crédit Suisse, the French Armed Forces are ranked as the world's sixth-most powerful military, and the most powerful in Europe, only behind Russia.[172] While the Gendarmerie is an integral part of the French armed forces (gendarmes are career soldiers), and therefore under the purview of the Ministry of the Armed Forces, it is operationally attached to the Ministry of the Interior as far as its civil police duties are concerned. When acting as general purpose police force, the Gendarmerie encompasses the counter terrorist units of the Parachute Intervention Squadron of the National Gendarmerie (Escadron Parachutiste d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale), the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group (Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale), the Search Sections of the National Gendarmerie (Sections de Recherche de la Gendarmerie Nationale), responsible for criminal enquiries, and the Mobile Brigades of the National Gendarmerie (Brigades mobiles de la Gendarmerie Nationale, or in short Gendarmerie mobile) which have the task to maintain public order. The following special units are also part of the Gendarmerie: the Republican Guard (Garde républicaine) which protects public buildings hosting major French institutions, the Maritime Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie maritime) serving as Coast Guard, the Provost Service (Prévôté), acting as the Military Police branch of the Gendarmerie. Bastille Day in ParisNational GendarmerieCombined Arms SchoolNational Active Non-Commissioned Officers School As far as the French intelligence units are concerned, the Directorate-General for External Security (Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure) is considered to be a component of the Armed Forces under the authority of the Ministry of Defense. The other, the Central Directorate for Interior Intelligence (Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur) is a division of the National Police Force (Direction générale de la Police Nationale), and therefore reports directly to the Ministry of the Interior. There has been no national conscription since 1997.[173] France has a special military corps, the French Foreign Legion, founded in 1830, which consists of foreign nationals from over 140 countries who are willing to serve in the French Armed Forces and become French citizens after the end of their service period. The only other countries having similar units are Spain (the Spanish Foreign Legion, called Tercio, was founded in 1920) and Luxembourg (foreigners can serve in the National Army provided they speak Luxembourgish). France is a permanent member of the Security Council of the UN, and a recognised nuclear state since 1960. France has signed and ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)[174] and acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. France's annual military expenditure in 2018 was US$63.8 billion, or 2.3% of its GDP, making it the fifth biggest military spender in the world after the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, and India.[175] French nuclear deterrence, (formerly known as ""Force de Frappe""), relies on complete independence. The current French nuclear force consists of four Triomphant class submarines equipped with submarine-launched ballistic missiles. In addition to the submarine fleet, it is estimated that France has about 60 ASMP medium-range air-to-ground missiles with nuclear warheads,[176] of which around 50 are deployed by the Air and Space Force using the Mirage 2000N long-range nuclear strike aircraft, while around 10 are deployed by the French Navy's Super Étendard Modernisé (SEM) attack aircraft, which operate from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. The new Rafale F3 aircraft will gradually replace all Mirage 2000N and SEM in the nuclear strike role with the improved ASMP-A missile with a nuclear warhead. France has major military industries with one of the largest aerospace industries in the world.[177][178] Its industries have produced such equipment as the Rafale fighter, the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, the Exocet missile and the Leclerc tank among others. Despite withdrawing from the Eurofighter project, France is actively investing in European joint projects such as the Eurocopter Tiger, multipurpose frigates, the UCAV demonstrator nEUROn and the Airbus A400M. France is a major arms seller,[179][180] with most of its arsenal's designs available for the export market with the notable exception of nuclear-powered devices. France has consistently developed its cybersecurity capabilities, which are regularly ranked as some of the most robust of any nation of the world.[181][182] The Bastille Day military parade held in Paris each 14 July for France's national day, called Bastille Day in English-speaking countries (referred to in France as Fête nationale), is the oldest and largest regular military parade in Europe. Other smaller parades are organised across the country. Government finance See also: Taxation in France The Government of France has run a budget deficit each year since the early 1970s. As of 2016[update], French government debt levels reached 2.2 trillion euros, the equivalent of 96.4% of French GDP.[183] In late 2012, credit rating agencies warned that growing French Government debt levels risked France's AAA credit rating, raising the possibility of a future downgrade and subsequent higher borrowing costs for the French authorities.[184] However, in July 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the French government issued 10-years bonds which had negative interest rates, for the first time in its history.[185] France also possesses in 2020 the fourth-largest gold reserves in the world.[186] Economy Main article: Economy of France La Défense (as seen from the Eiffel Tower) was in 2017 ranked by Ernst & Young as the leading Central business district in continental Europe, and the fourth in the world.[187] A member of the Group of Seven (formerly Group of Eight) leading industrialized countries, as of 2020[update], it is ranked as the world's tenth largest and the EU's second largest economy by purchasing power parity.[188] France joined 11 other EU members to launch the euro in 1999, with euro coins and banknotes completely replacing the French franc (₣) in 2002.[189] France has a diversified economy,[190] that is dominated by the service sector (which represented in 2017 78.8% of its GDP), whilst the industrial sector accounted for 19.5% of its GDP and the primary sector accounted for the remaining 1.7%.[191] The fifth largest trading nation in the world (and second in Europe after Germany). It is the third largest manufacturing country in Europe behind Germany and Italy. France is also the most visited destination in the world,[192][193] as well the European Union's leading agricultural power.[194] France was in 2019 the largest Foreign Direct Investment recipient in Europe,[195] Europe's second largest spender in Research and development,[196] ranked among the 10 most innovative countries in the world by the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index,[197] as well as the 15th most competitive nation globally, according to the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report (up 2 notches compared to 2018).[198] According to the IMF, in 2020, France was the world's 20th country by GDP per capita with $39,257 per inhabitant. In 2019, France was listed on the United Nations's Human Development Index with a value of 0.901 (indicating very high human development) and 23rd on the Corruption Perceptions Index in 2019.[199][200] Composition of the French economy (GDP) in 2016 by expenditure type In 2018, France was the 5th largest trading nation in the world, as well as the second-largest trading nation in Europe (after Germany).[201] France is part of a monetary union, the Eurozone (dark blue), and of the European Single Market (lighter blue). Financial services, banking and the insurance sector are an important part of the economy. Three largest financial institutions cooperatively owned by their customers are located in France.[202] The Paris stock exchange (French: La Bourse de Paris) is an old institution, created by Louis XV in 1724.[203] In 2000, the stock exchanges of Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels merged into Euronext.[204] In 2007, Euronext merged with the New York stock exchange to form NYSE Euronext, the world's largest stock exchange.[204] Euronext Paris, the French branch of the NYSE Euronext group is Europe's 2nd largest stock exchange market, behind the London Stock Exchange. French companies have maintained key positions in the insurance and banking industries: AXA was in 2019 the world's third largest insurance company by total non banking assets.[205] The leading French banks are BNP Paribas and the Crédit Agricole, both ranking among the top 10 largest banks by assets according to a 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence report.[206] According to the same source, Société Générale and Groupe BPCE were in 2020 the world's 17th and 19th largest banks, respectively.[206] France is a member of the Eurozone (around 330 million consumers) which is part of the European Single Market (more than 500 million consumers). Several domestic commercial policies are determined by agreements among European Union (EU) members and by EU legislation. France introduced the common European currency, the Euro in 2002.[207][208] Agriculture Champagne is from the Champagne region in Northeast France. France has historically been a large producer of agricultural products.[209] Extensive tracts of fertile land, the application of modern technology, and EU subsidies have combined to make France the leading agricultural producer and exporter in Europe[210] (representing 20% of the EU's agricultural production)[211] and the world's third biggest exporter of agricultural products.[212] Wheat, poultry, dairy, beef, and pork, as well as internationally recognized processed foods are the primary French agricultural exports. Rosé wines are primarily consumed within the country, but Champagne and Bordeaux wines are major exports, being known worldwide. EU agriculture subsidies to France have decreased in recent years but still amounted to $8 billion in 2007.[213] That same year, France sold 33.4 billion euros of transformed agricultural products.[214] France produces rum via sugar cane-based distilleries almost all of which are located in overseas territories such as Martinique, Guadeloupe and La Réunion. Agriculture is an important sector of France's economy: 3.8% of the active population is employed in agriculture, whereas the total agri-food industry made up 4.2% of French GDP in 2005.[211] Tourism Main article: Tourism in France The Eiffel Tower is the world's most visited paid monument, an icon of both Paris and France. The Château de Marqueyssac, featuring a French formal garden, is one of the Remarkable Gardens of France. With 89 million international tourist arrivals in 2018,[215] France is ranked as the first tourist destination in the world, ahead of Spain (83 million) and the United States (80 million). It is third in income from tourism due to shorter duration of visits.[216] The most popular tourist sites include (annual visitors): Eiffel Tower (6.2 million), Château de Versailles (2.8 million), Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle (2 million), Pont du Gard (1.5 million), Arc de Triomphe (1.2 million), Mont Saint-Michel (1 million), Sainte-Chapelle (683,000), Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg (549,000), Puy de Dôme (500,000), Musée Picasso (441,000), and Carcassonne (362,000).[217] Paris region France, especially Paris, has some of the world's largest and most renowned museums, including the Louvre, which is the most visited art museum in the world (5.7 million), the Musée d'Orsay (2.1 million), mostly devoted to Impressionism, the Musée de l'Orangerie (1.02 million), which is home to eight large Water Lily murals by Claude Monet, as well as the Centre Georges Pompidou (1.2 million), dedicated to contemporary art. Disneyland Paris is Europe's most popular theme park, with 15 million combined visitors to the resort's Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park in 2009.[218] French Riviera With more than 10 millions tourists a year, the French Riviera (French: Côte d'Azur), in Southeast France, is the second leading tourist destination in the country, after the Paris region.[219] It benefits from 300 days of sunshine per year, 115 kilometres (71 mi) of coastline and beaches, 18 golf courses, 14 ski resorts and 3,000 restaurants.[220]:31 Each year the Côte d'Azur hosts 50% of the world's superyacht fleet.[220]:66 Châteaux With 6 millions tourists a year, the castles of the Loire Valley (French: châteaux) and the Loire Valley itself are the third leading tourist destination in France;[221][222] this World Heritage site is noteworthy for its architectural heritage, in its historic towns but in particular its castles, such as the Châteaux d'Amboise, de Chambord, d'Ussé, de Villandry, Chenonceau and Montsoreau. The Château de Chantilly, Versailles and Vaux-le-Vicomte, all three located near Paris, are also visitor attractions. Other protected areas France has 37 sites inscribed in UNESCO's World Heritage List and features cities of high cultural interest, beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, as well as rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity (green tourism). Small and picturesque French villages are promoted through the association Les Plus Beaux Villages de France (literally ""The Most Beautiful Villages of France""). The ""Remarkable Gardens"" label is a list of the over 200 gardens classified by the Ministry of Culture. This label is intended to protect and promote remarkable gardens and parks. France attracts many religious pilgrims on their way to St. James, or to Lourdes, a town in the Hautes-Pyrénées that hosts several million visitors a year. Energy Further information: Energy in France France derives most of its electricity from nuclear power, the highest percentage in the world. Photograph of the Belleville Nuclear Power Plant Électricité de France (EDF), the main electricity generation and distribution company in France, is also one of the world's largest producers of electricity. In 2018, it produced around 20% of the European Union's electricity,[223] primarily from nuclear power. France is the smallest emitter of carbon dioxide among the G8, due to its heavy investment in nuclear power.[224] As of 2016[update], 72% of the electricity produced by France is generated by 58 nuclear power plants.[225][226] In this context, renewable energies are having difficulty taking off. France also uses hydroelectric dams to produce electricity, such as the Eguzon dam, Étang de Soulcem and Lac de Vouglans. Transport Main article: Transport in France A TGV Duplex crossing the Cize–Bolozon viaduct. The train can reach a maximum speed of 360 kilometres per hour (220 mph). The railway network of France, which as of 2008[update] stretches 29,473 kilometres (18,314 mi)[227] is the second most extensive in Western Europe after that of Germany.[228] It is operated by the SNCF, and high-speed trains include the Thalys, the Eurostar and TGV, which travels at 320 km/h (199 mph) in commercial use.[229] The Eurostar, along with the Eurotunnel Shuttle, connects with the United Kingdom through the Channel Tunnel. Rail connections exist to all other neighboring countries in Europe, except Andorra. Intra-urban connections are also well developed with both underground services (Paris, Lyon, Lille, Marseille, Toulouse, Rennes) and tramway services (Nantes, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Grenoble, Montpellier...) complementing bus services. There are approximately 1,027,183 kilometres (638,262 mi) of serviceable roadway in France, ranking it the most extensive network of the European continent.[230] The Paris region is enveloped with the most dense network of roads and highways that connect it with virtually all parts of the country. French roads also handle substantial international traffic, connecting with cities in neighboring Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Andorra and Monaco. There is no annual registration fee or road tax; however, usage of the mostly privately owned motorways is through tolls except in the vicinity of large communes. The new car market is dominated by domestic brands such as Renault, Peugeot and Citroën.[231] France possesses the Millau Viaduct, the world's tallest bridge,[232] and has built many important bridges such as the Pont de Normandie. Diesel and gasoline fuelled cars and lorries cause a large part of the country's air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.[233][234] Air France is one of the biggest airlines in the world. There are 464 airports in France.[98] Charles de Gaulle Airport, located in the vicinity of Paris, is the largest and busiest airport in the country, handling the vast majority of popular and commercial traffic and connecting Paris with virtually all major cities across the world. Air France is the national carrier airline, although numerous private airline companies provide domestic and international travel services. There are ten major ports in France, the largest of which is in Marseille,[235] which also is the largest bordering the Mediterranean Sea.[236][237] 12,261 kilometres (7,619 mi) of waterways traverse France including the Canal du Midi, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean through the Garonne river.[98] Science and technology Main articles: Science and technology in France and List of French inventions and discoveries France is in 2020 the biggest national financial contributor to the European Space Agency,[238] which conceived the Ariane rocket family, launched from French Guiana (Ariane 5 pictured). Since the Middle Ages, France has been a major contributor to scientific and technological achievement. Around the beginning of the 11th century, Pope Sylvester II, born Gerbert d'Aurillac, reintroduced the abacus and armillary sphere, and introduced Arabic numerals and clocks to Northern and Western Europe.[239] The University of Paris, founded in the mid-12th century, is still one of the most important universities in the Western world.[240] In the 17th century, mathematician René Descartes defined a method for the acquisition of scientific knowledge, while Blaise Pascal became famous for his work on probability and fluid mechanics. They were both key figures of the Scientific Revolution, which blossomed in Europe during this period. The Academy of Sciences was founded by Louis XIV to encourage and protect the spirit of French scientific research. It was at the forefront of scientific developments in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. It is one of the earliest academies of sciences. The Age of Enlightenment was marked by the work of biologist Buffon and chemist Lavoisier, who discovered the role of oxygen in combustion, while Diderot and D'Alembert published the Encyclopédie, which aimed to give access to ""useful knowledge"" to the people, a knowledge that they can apply to their everyday life.[241] With the Industrial Revolution, the 19th century saw spectacular scientific developments in France with scientists such as Augustin Fresnel, founder of modern optics, Sadi Carnot who laid the foundations of thermodynamics, and Louis Pasteur, a pioneer of microbiology. Other eminent French scientists of the 19th century have their names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. Famous French scientists of the 20th century include the mathematician and physicist Henri Poincaré, physicists Henri Becquerel, Pierre and Marie Curie, who remained famous for their work on radioactivity, the physicist Paul Langevin and virologist Luc Montagnier, co-discoverer of HIV AIDS. Hand transplantation was developed on 23 September 1998 in Lyon by a team assembled from different countries around the world including Jean-Michel Dubernard who, shortly thereafter, performed the first successful double hand transplant.[242] Telesurgery was developed by Jacques Marescaux and his team on 7 September 2001 across the Atlantic Ocean (New-York-Strasbourg, Lindbergh Operation).[243] A face transplant was first done on 27 November 2005[244][245] by Dr. Bernard Devauchelle. The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble France was the fourth country to achieve nuclear capability[246] and has the third largest nuclear weapons arsenal in the world.[247] It is also a leader in civilian nuclear technology.[248][249][250] France was the third nation, after the former USSR and the United States, to launch its own space satellite and remains the biggest contributor to the European Space Agency (ESA).[251][252][253] The European Airbus, formed from the French group Aérospatiale along with DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG (DASA) and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA), designs and develops civil and military aircraft as well as communications systems, missiles, space rockets, helicopters, satellites, and related systems. France also hosts major international research instruments such as the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility or the Institut Laue–Langevin and remains a major member of CERN. It also owns Minatec, Europe's leading nanotechnology research center. The SNCF, the French national railroad company, has developed the TGV, a high speed train which holds a series of world speed records. The TGV has been the fastest wheeled train in commercial use since reaching a speed of 574.8 km/h (357.2 mph) on 3 April 2007.[254] Western Europe is now serviced by a network of TGV lines. The Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) has been ranked by the Nature Index 2020 as the fourth institution with highest share of articles published in scientific journals in the world.[255] France itself was the 6th nation globally with the highest share of articles published in scientific journals according to the Nature Index 2020, which is valid for the calendar year 2019.[256] As of 2018[update], 69 French people have been awarded a Nobel Prize[257] and 12 have received the Fields Medal.[258] Demographics Main articles: Demographics of France and French people Population density in France by arrondissement. The main urban areas are visible, notably the Paris (center-north), Lille (north), Marseille (southeast) and Lyon (center-southeast) urban areas. With an estimated May 2021 population of 67.413 million people,[259] France is the 20th most populous country in the world, the third-most populous in Europe (after Russia and Germany), and the second most populous in the European Union (after Germany). France is an outlier among developed countries, particularly in Europe, for its relatively high rate of natural population growth: By birth rates alone, it was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the European Union in 2006.[260] Between 2006 and 2016, France saw the second highest overall increase in population in the EU, and was one of only four EU countries where natural births accounted for most population growth.[261] This was the highest rate since the end of the baby boom in 1973, and coincides with the rise of the total fertility rate from a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010. As of January 2021[update], the fertility rate declined slightly to 1.84 children per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1, and considerably below the high of 4.41 in 1800.[262][263][264][265] France's fertility rate and crude birth rate nonetheless remain among the highest in the EU. However, like many developed nations, the French population is aging; the average age is 41.7 years, while about a fifth of French people are 65 or over.[266] Average life expectancy at birth is 82.7 years, the 12th highest in the world. From 2006 to 2011, population growth averaged 0.6 percent per year;[267] since 2011, annual growth has been between 0.4 and 0.5 percent annually.[268] Immigrants are major contributors to this trend; in 2010, 27 percent of newborns in metropolitan France had at least one foreign-born parent and another 24 percent had at least one parent born outside Europe (excluding French overseas territories).[269] Ethnic groups Most French people are of Celtic-Gallic origin, with a significant admixture of Italic (Romans) and Germanic (Franks) groups reflecting centuries of respective migration and settlement.[270] Through the course of the Middle Ages, France incorporated various neighboring ethnic and linguistic groups, as evidenced by Breton elements in the west, Aquitanian in the southwest, Scandinavian in the northwest, Alemannic in the northeast, and Ligurian in the southeast. Large-scale immigration over the last century and a half has led to a more multicultural society; beginning with the French Revolution, and further codified in the French Constitution of 1958, the government is prohibited from collecting data on ethnicity and ancestry; most demographic information is drawn from private sector organisations or academic institutions. In 2004, the Institut Montaigne estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were White (85% of the population), 6 million were Northwest African (10%), 2 million were Black (3.3%), and 1 million were Asian (1.7%).[271][272] A 2008 poll conducted jointly by INED and the French National Institute of Statistics[273][274] estimated that the largest ancestry groups were Italian (5 million), followed by Northwest African (3-6 million),[275][276][277] Sub-Saharan African (2.5 million), Armenian (500,000), and Turkish (200,000).[278] There are also sizable minorities of other European ethnic groups, namely Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, and Greek.[275][279][280] France has a significant Gitan (Romani) population, numbering between 20,000 and 400,000;[281] many foreign Roma are expelled back to Bulgaria and Romania frequently.[282] Immigration It is currently estimated that 40% of the French population is descended at least partially from the different waves of immigration since the early 20th century;[283] between 1921 and 1935 alone, about 1.1 million net immigrants came to France.[284] The next largest wave came in the 1960s, when around 1.6 million pieds noirs returned to France following the independence of its Northwest African possessions, Algeria and Morocco.[285][286] They were joined by numerous former colonial subjects from North and West Africa, as well as numerous European immigrants from Spain and Portugal. France remains a major destination for immigrants, accepting about 200,000 legal immigrants annually.[287] In 2005, it was Western Europe's leading recipient of asylum seekers, with an estimated 50,000 applications (albeit 15% decrease from 2004).[288] In 2010, France received about 48,100 asylum applications—placing it among the top five asylum recipients in the world[289] and in subsequent years it saw the number of applications increase, ultimately doubling to 100,412 in 2017.[290] The European Union allows free movement between the member states, although France established controls to curb Eastern European migration,[citation needed] and immigration remains a contentious political issue. In 2008, the INSEE (National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) estimated that the total number of foreign-born immigrants was around 5 million (8% of the population), while their French-born descendants numbered 6.5 million, or 11% of the population. Thus, nearly a fifth of the country's population were either first or second-generation immigrants, of which more than 5 million were of European origin and 4 million of Maghrebi ancestry.[291][292][293] In 2008, France granted citizenship to 137,000 persons, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and Turkey.[294] In 2014, an INSEE reported doubling of the number of Spanish immigrants, Portuguese and Italians in France between 2009 and 2012. According to the French Institute, this increase resulting from the financial crisis that hit several European countries in that period, has pushed up the number of Europeans installed in France.[295] Statistics on Spanish immigrants in France show a growth of 107 percent between 2009 and 2012, i.e. in this period went from 5,300 to 11,000 people.[295] Of the total of 229,000 foreigners who were in France in 2012, nearly 8% were Portuguese, 5% British, 5% Spanish, 4% Italians, 4% Germans, 3% Romanians, and 3% Belgians.[295] Major cities See also: Urban area (France) and Urban unit France is a highly urbanized country, with its largest cities (in terms of metropolitan area population in 2016[296]) being Paris (12,568,755 inh.), Lyon (2,310,850), Marseille (1,756,296), Toulouse (1,345,343), Bordeaux (1,232,550), Lille (1,187,824), Nice (1,006,402), Nantes (961,521), Strasbourg (785,839) and Rennes (727,357). (Note: There are significant differences between the metropolitan population figures just cited and those in the following table, which indicates the population of the communes). Rural flight was a perennial political issue throughout most of the 20th century. vte Largest cities or towns in France2016 census Rank Name Region Pop. Rank Name Region Pop.

Since 1635, the Académie française has been France's official authority on the French language, although its recommendations carry no legal weight. There are also regional languages spoken in France, such as Occitan, Breton, Catalan, Flemish (Dutch dialect), Alsatian (German dialect), Basque, and Corsican. Italian was the official language of Corsica until 9 May 1859.[298] The Government of France does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications. In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the European Union and globally through institutions such as the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. The perceived threat from anglicisation has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France. Besides French, there exist 77 vernacular minority languages of France, eight spoken in French metropolitan territory and 69 in the French overseas territories. From the 17th to the mid-20th century, French served as the pre-eminent international language of diplomacy and international affairs as well as a lingua franca among the educated classes of Europe.[299] The dominant position of French language in international affairs was overtaken by English, since the emergence of the United States as a major power.[59][300][301] For most of the time in which French served as an international lingua franca, it was not the native language of most Frenchmen: a report in 1794 conducted by Henri Grégoire found that of the country's 25 million people, only three million spoke French natively; the rest spoke one of the country's many regional languages, such as Alsatian, Breton or Occitan.[302] Through the expansion of public education, in which French was the sole language of instruction, as well as other factors such as increased urbanisation and the rise of mass communication, French gradually came to be adopted by virtually the entire population, a process not completed until the 20th century. As a result of France's extensive colonial ambitions between the 17th and 20th centuries, French was introduced to the Americas, Africa, Polynesia, South-East Asia, as well as the Caribbean. French is the second most studied foreign language in the world after English,[303] and is a lingua franca in some regions, notably in Africa. The legacy of French as a living language outside Europe is mixed: it is nearly extinct in some former French colonies (The Levant, South and Southeast Asia), while creoles and pidgins based on French have emerged in the French departments in the West Indies and the South Pacific (French Polynesia). On the other hand, many former French colonies have adopted French as an official language, and the total number of French speakers is increasing, especially in Africa. It is estimated that between 300 million[304] and 500 million[305] people worldwide can speak French, either as a mother tongue or a second language. According to the 2007 Adult Education survey, part of a project by the European Union and carried in France by the INSEE and based on a sample of 15,350 persons, French was the native language of 87.2% of the total population, or roughly 55.81 million people, followed by Arabic (3.6%, 2.3 million), Portuguese (1.5%, 960,000), Spanish (1.2%, 770,000) and Italian (1.0%, 640,000). Native speakers of other languages made up the remaining 5.2% of the population.[306] Religion Main article: Religion in France Notre-Dame de Reims is the Roman Catholic cathedral where the Kings of France were crowned until 1825.[XIV] France is a secular country in which freedom of religion is a constitutional right. French religious policy is based on the concept of laïcité, a strict separation of church and state under which public life is kept completely secular. According to a survey held in 2016 by Institut Montaigne and Institut français d'opinion publique (IFOP), 51.1% of the total population of France was Christian, 39.6% had no religion (atheism or agnosticism), 5.6% were Muslims, 2.5% were followers of other faiths, and the remaining 0.4% were undecided about their faith.[307] Estimates of the number of Muslims in France vary widely. In 2003, the French Ministry of the Interior estimated the total number of people of Muslim background to be between 5 and 6 million (8–10%).[308][309] The current Jewish community in France is the largest in Europe and the third-largest in the world after Israel and the United States, ranging between 480,000 and 600,000, about 0.8% of the population as of 2016.[307] Catholicism has been the predominant religion in France for more than a millennium, though it is not as actively practised today as it was. Among the 47,000 religious buildings in France, 94% are Roman Catholic.[310] During the French Revolution, activists conducted a brutal campaign of de-Christianisation, ending the Catholic Church as the state religion. In some cases clergy and churches were attacked, with iconoclasm stripping the churches of statues and ornaments. After alternating between royal and secular republican governments during the 19th century, in 1905 France passed the 1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, which established the principle of laïcité.[311] To this day, the government is prohibited from recognizing any specific right to a religious community (except for legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the local law in Alsace-Moselle). It recognizes religious organisations according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine. Conversely, religious organisations are expected to refrain from intervening in policy-making.[312] Certain groups, such as Scientology, Children of God, the Unification Church, and the Order of the Solar Temple are considered cults (""sectes"" in French), and therefore do not have the same status as recognized religions in France.[313] Secte is considered a pejorative term in France.[314] Health Main article: Health in France The Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, a teaching hospital in Paris, is one of Europe's largest hospitals.[315] The French health care system is one of universal health care largely financed by government national health insurance. In its 2000 assessment of world health care systems, the World Health Organization found that France provided the ""close to best overall health care"" in the world.[316] The French healthcare system was ranked first worldwide by the World Health Organization in 1997.[317][318] In 2011, France spent 11.6% of GDP on health care, or US$4,086 per capita,[319] a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in Europe but less than in the United States. Approximately 77% of health expenditures are covered by government funded agencies.[320] Care is generally free for people affected by chronic diseases (affections de longues durées) such as cancer, AIDS or cystic fibrosis. Average life expectancy at birth is 78 years for men and 85 years for women, one of the highest of the European Union and the World.[321][322] There are 3.22 physicians for every 1000 inhabitants in France,[323] and average health care spending per capita was US$4,719 in 2008.[324] As of 2007[update], approximately 140,000 inhabitants (0.4%) of France are living with HIV/AIDS.[98] Even if the French have the reputation of being one of the thinnest people in developed countries,[325][326][327][328][329] France—like other rich countries—faces an increasing and recent epidemic of obesity, due mostly to the replacement in French eating habits of traditional healthy French cuisine by junk food.[330][325][326][331] The French obesity rate is still far below that of the United States—currently equal to American rate in the 1970s—and is still the lowest of Europe.[326][328][331] Authorities now regard obesity as one of the main public health issues and fight it fiercely.[332] Rates of childhood obesity are slowing in France, while continuing to grow in other countries.[333] Education Main article: Education in France The École normale supérieure (ENS) in Paris, established in the end of the 18th century, produces more Nobel Prize laureates per capita than any other institution in the world.[334] In 1802, Napoleon created the lycée, the second and final stage of secondary education that prepares students for higher education studies or a profession.[335] Nevertheless, Jules Ferry is considered the father of the French modern school, leading reforms in the late 19th century that established free, secular, and compulsory education (currently mandatory until the age of 16).[336][337] French education is centralized and divided into three stages: Primary, secondary, and higher education. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranked France's education as below OECD average in 2018.[338] Primary and secondary education are predominantly public, run by the Ministry of National Education. While training and remuneration of teachers and the curriculum are the responsibility of the state centrally, the management of primary and secondary schools is overseen by local authorities. Primary education comprises two phases, nursery school (école maternelle) and elementary school (école élémentaire). Nursery school aims to stimulate the minds of very young children and promote their socialization and development of a basic grasp of language and number. Around the age of six, children transfer to elementary school, whose primary objectives are learning about writing, arithmetic and citizenship. Secondary education also consists of two phases. The first is delivered through colleges (collège) and leads to the national certificate (Diplôme national du brevet). The second is offered in high schools (lycée) and finishes in national exams leading to a baccalaureate (baccalauréat, available in professional, technical or general flavors) or certificate of professional competence (certificat d'aptitude professionelle). Higher education is divided between public universities and the prestigious and selective Grandes écoles, such as Sciences Po Paris for Political studies, HEC Paris for Economics, Polytechnique, the École des hautes études en sciences sociales for Social studies and the École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris that produce high-profile engineers, or the École nationale d'administration for careers in the Grands Corps of the state. The Grandes écoles have been criticized for alleged elitism, producing many if not most of France's high-ranking civil servants, CEOs, and politicians.[339] Culture Main article: Culture of France Eugène Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People (1830) portrays the July Revolution using the stylistic views of Romanticism. Since Liberty is part of the motto ""Liberté, égalité, fraternité"", as the French put it, this painting has become the primary symbol of the French Republic. France has been a centre of Western cultural development for centuries. Many French artists have been among the most renowned of their time; France is still recognised in the world for its rich cultural tradition.[340] The successive political regimes have always promoted artistic creation. The creation of the Ministry of Culture in 1959 helped preserve the cultural heritage of the country and make it available to the public. The Ministry of Culture has been very active since its creation, granting subsidies to artists, promoting French culture in the world, supporting festivals and cultural events, protecting historical monuments. The French government also succeeded in maintaining a cultural exception to defend audiovisual products made in the country.[341] France receives the highest number of tourists per year, largely thanks to the numerous cultural establishments and historical buildings implanted all over the territory. It counts 1,200 museums welcoming more than 50 million people annually.[342] The most important cultural sites are run by the government, for instance through the public agency Centre des monuments nationaux, which is responsible for approximately 85 national historical monuments. The 43,180 buildings protected as historical monuments include mainly residences (many castles) and religious buildings (cathedrals, basilicas, churches), but also statues, memorials and gardens. The UNESCO inscribed 45 sites in France on the World Heritage List.[343] Art Main article: French art The Louvre Museum, widely recognized as one of the finest art museums in the world, was in 2019 both the largest and the most-visited museum in the world.[344] The origins of French art were very much influenced by Flemish art and by Italian art at the time of the Renaissance. Jean Fouquet, the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance at first hand. The Renaissance painting School of Fontainebleau was directly inspired by Italian painters such as Primaticcio and Rosso Fiorentino, who both worked in France. Two of the most famous French artists of the time of Baroque era, Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain, lived in Italy. Claude Monet, founder of the Impressionist movement The 17th century was the period when French painting became prominent and individualised itself through classicism. Prime Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert founded in 1648 the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture under Louis XIV to protect these artists; in 1666 he also created the still-active French Academy in Rome to have direct relations with Italian artists. French artists developed the rococo style in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style, the works of the court-endorsed artists Antoine Watteau, François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as Napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as Jacques-Louis David and the highly influential Académie des Beaux-Arts defined the style known as Academism. At this time France had become a centre of artistic creation, the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements, at first Romanticism with Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix, then Realism with Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet, a style that eventually evolved into Naturalism. In the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting became even more important, with the development of new styles of painting such as Impressionism and Symbolism. The most famous impressionist painters of the period were Camille Pissarro, Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir.[345] The second generation of impressionist-style painters, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Georges Seurat, were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions,[346] as well as the fauvist artists Henri Matisse, André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck.[347][348] At the beginning of the 20th century, Cubism was developed by Georges Braque and the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, living in Paris. Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, such as Vincent van Gogh, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and Wassily Kandinsky. Le Penseur by Auguste Rodin (1902), Musée Rodin, Paris Many museums in France are entirely or partly devoted to sculptures and painting works. A huge collection of old masterpieces created before or during the 18th century are displayed in the state-owned Musée du Louvre, such as the Mona Lisa, also known as ""La Joconde"". While the Louvre Palace has been for a long time a museum, the Musée d'Orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station Gare d'Orsay, in a major reorganisation of national art collections, to gather French paintings from the second part of the 19th century (mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements).[349][350] The musée d'Orsay was voted in 2018 the best museum in the world.[351] Modern works are presented in the Musée National d'Art Moderne, which moved in 1976 to the Centre Georges Pompidou. These three state-owned museums welcome close to 17 million people a year.[352] Other national museums hosting paintings include the Grand Palais (1.3 million visitors in 2008), but there are also many museums owned by cities, the most visited being the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (0.8 million entries in 2008), which hosts contemporary works.[352] Outside Paris, all the large cities have a Museum of Fine Arts with a section dedicated to European and French painting. Some of the finest collections are in Lyon, Lille, Rouen, Dijon, Rennes and Grenoble. Architecture Main article: French architecture Saint Louis's Sainte-Chapelle represents the French impact on religious architecture. During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers. Some French castles that survived are Chinon, Château d'Angers, the massive Château de Vincennes and the so-called Cathar castles. During this era, France had been using Romanesque architecture like most of Western Europe. Some of the greatest examples of Romanesque churches in France are the Saint Sernin Basilica in Toulouse, the largest romanesque church in Europe,[353] and the remains of the Cluniac Abbey. The Gothic architecture, originally named Opus Francigenum meaning ""French work"",[354] was born in Île-de-France and was the first French style of architecture to be copied in all Europe.[355] Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic cathedrals and basilicas, the first of these being the Saint Denis Basilica (used as the royal necropolis); other important French Gothic cathedrals are Notre-Dame de Chartres and Notre-Dame d'Amiens. The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church: Notre-Dame de Reims.[356] Aside from churches, Gothic Architecture had been used for many religious palaces, the most important one being the Palais des Papes in Avignon. The final victory in the Hundred Years' War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture. It was the time of the French Renaissance and several artists from Italy were invited to the French court; many residential palaces were built in the Loire Valley, from 1450 with as a first reference the Château de Montsoreau.[357] Such residential castles were the Château de Chambord, the Château de Chenonceau, or the Château d'Amboise. Following the renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages, Baroque architecture replaced the traditional Gothic style. However, in France, baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one.[358] In the secular domain, the Palace of Versailles has many baroque features. Jules Hardouin Mansart, who designed the extensions to Versailles, was one of the most influential French architect of the baroque era; he is famous for his dome at Les Invalides.[359] Some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as the Place Stanislas in Nancy. On the military architectural side, Vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over Europe, the Americas, Russia and Turkey.[360][361] Place de la Bourse in Bordeaux, an example of French baroque architecture After the Revolution, the Republicans favoured Neoclassicism although it was introduced in France prior to the revolution with such buildings as the Parisian Pantheon or the Capitole de Toulouse. Built during the first French Empire, the Arc de Triomphe and Sainte Marie-Madeleine represent the best example of Empire style architecture.[362] Under Napoleon III, a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth; extravagant buildings such as the neo-baroque Palais Garnier were built. The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; for example, Haussmann's renovation of Paris. The architecture associated to this era is named Second Empire in English, the term being taken from the Second French Empire. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. In the late 19th century, Gustave Eiffel designed many bridges, such as Garabit viaduct, and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the iconic Eiffel Tower. The Capitole de Toulouse hosts Toulouse City Hall. In the 20th century, French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier designed several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The Louvre Pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 metres (121 ft).[363] France's largest financial district is La Defense, where a significant number of skyscrapers are located.[364] Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the Millau Viaduct. Some famous modern French architects include Jean Nouvel, Dominique Perrault, Christian de Portzamparc or Paul Andreu. Literature Main article: French literature The earliest French literature dates from the Middle Ages, when what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language. There were several languages and dialects, and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of French medieval texts are unknown, such as Tristan and Iseult and Lancelot-Grail. Other authors are known, for example Chrétien de Troyes and Duke William IX of Aquitaine, who wrote in Occitan. Much medieval French poetry and literature were inspired by the legends of the Matter of France, such as The Song of Roland and the various chansons de geste. The Roman de Renart, written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the medieval character Reynard ('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing. An important 16th-century writer was François Rabelais, whose novel Gargantua and Pantagruel has remained famous and appreciated until now. Michel de Montaigne was the other major figure of the French literature during that century. His most famous work, Essais, created the literary genre of the essay.[365] French poetry during that century was embodied by Pierre de Ronsard and Joachim du Bellay. Both writers founded the La Pléiade literary movement. During the 17th century, Madame de La Fayette published anonymously La Princesse de Clèves, a novel that is considered to be one of the first psychological novels of all time.[366] Jean de La Fontaine is one of the most famous fabulists of that time, as he wrote hundreds of fables, some being far more famous than others, such as The Ant and the Grasshopper. Generations of French pupils had to learn his fables, that were seen as helping teaching wisdom and common sense to the young people. Some of his verses have entered the popular language to become proverbs, such as ""À l'œuvre, on connaît l'artisan.""[A workman is known by his chips].[367] French literary figures. Clockwise from top left: Molière is the most played author in the Comédie-Française;[368] Victor Hugo is one of the most important French novelists and poets; 19th-century poet, writer and translator Charles Baudelaire; 20th-century philosopher and novelist Jean-Paul Sartre Jean Racine, whose incredible mastery of the alexandrine and of the French language has been praised for centuries, created plays such as Phèdre or Britannicus. He is, along with Pierre Corneille (Le Cid) and Molière, considered as one of the three great dramatists of France's golden age. Molière, who is deemed to be one of the greatest masters of comedy of the Western literature,[369] wrote dozens of plays, including Le Misanthrope, L'Avare, Le Malade imaginaire, as well as Le Bourgeois gentilhomme. His plays have been so popular around the world that French language is sometimes dubbed as ""the language of Molière"" (la langue de Molière),[370] just like English is considered as ""the language of Shakespeare"". French literature and poetry flourished even more in the 18th and 19th centuries. Denis Diderot's best-known works are Jacques the Fatalist and Rameau's Nephew. He is however best known for being the main redactor of the Encyclopédie, whose aim was to sum up all the knowledge of his century (in fields such as arts, sciences, languages, and philosophy) and to present them to the people, to fight ignorance and obscurantism. During that same century, Charles Perrault was a prolific writer of famous children's fairy tales including Puss in Boots, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Bluebeard. At the start of the 19th century, symbolist poetry was an important movement in French literature, with poets such as Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé.[371] The 19th century saw the writings of many renowned French authors. Victor Hugo is sometimes seen as ""the greatest French writer of all time""[372] for excelling in all literary genres. The preface of his play Cromwell is considered to be the manifesto of the Romantic movement. Les Contemplations and La Légende des siècles are considered as ""poetic masterpieces"",[373] Hugo's verse having been compared to that of Shakespeare, Dante and Homer.[373] His novel Les Misérables is widely seen as one of the greatest novel ever written[374] and The Hunchback of Notre Dame has remained immensely popular. Other major authors of that century include Alexandre Dumas (The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte-Cristo), Jules Verne (Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea), Émile Zola (Les Rougon-Macquart), Honoré de Balzac (La Comédie humaine), Guy de Maupassant, Théophile Gautier and Stendhal (The Red and the Black, The Charterhouse of Parma), whose works are among the most well known in France and the world. The Prix Goncourt is a French literary prize first awarded in 1903.[375] Important writers of the 20th century include Marcel Proust, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Antoine de Saint Exupéry wrote Little Prince, which has remained popular for decades with children and adults around the world.[376] As of 2014[update], French authors had more Literature Nobel Prizes than those of any other nation.[377] The first Nobel Prize in Literature was a French author, while France's latest Nobel prize in literature is Patrick Modiano, who was awarded the prize in 2014.[377] Jean-Paul Sartre was also the first nominee in the committee's history to refuse the prize in 1964.[377] Philosophy Main article: French philosophy Medieval philosophy was dominated by Scholasticism until the emergence of Humanism in the Renaissance. Modern philosophy began in France in the 17th century with the philosophy of René Descartes, Blaise Pascal and Nicolas Malebranche. Descartes was the first Western philosopher since ancient times to attempt to build a philosophical system from the ground up rather than building on the work of predecessors.""[378][379] His Meditations on First Philosophy changed the primary object of philosophical thought and raised some of the most fundamental problems for foreigners such as Spinoza, Leibniz, Hume, Berkeley, and Kant. René Descartes, founder of modern Western philosophy[380] French philosophers produced some of the most important political works of the Age of Enlightenment. In The Spirit of the Laws, Baron de Montesquieu theorised the principle of separation of powers, which has been implemented in all liberal democracies since it was first applied in the United States. Voltaire came to embody the Enlightenment with his defence of civil liberties, such as the right to a free trial and freedom of religion. 19th-century French thought was targeted at responding to the social malaise following the French Revolution. Rationalist philosophers such as Victor Cousin and Auguste Comte, who called for a new social doctrine, were opposed by reactionary thinkers such as Joseph de Maistre, Louis de Bonald and Félicité Robert de Lamennais, who blamed the rationalist rejection of traditional order. De Maistre, together with the Englishman Edmund Burke, was one of the founders of European conservatism. Comte was the founder of positivism, which Émile Durkheim reformulated as a basis for social research. In the 20th century, partly as a reaction to the perceived excesses of positivism, French spiritualism thrived with thinkers such as Henri Bergson and it influenced American pragmatism and Whitehead's version of process philosophy. Meanwhile, French epistemology became a prominent school of thought with Jules Henri Poincaré, Gaston Bachelard, Jean Cavaillès and Jules Vuillemin. Influenced by German phenomenology and existentialism, the philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre gained a strong influence after World War II, and late-20th-century-France became the cradle of postmodern philosophy with Jean-François Lyotard, Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault. Music Main article: Music of France Claude Debussy France has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed a number of talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include Marc-Antoine Charpentier, François Couperin, Michel-Richard Delalande, Jean-Baptiste Lully and Marin Marais, all of them composers at the court. After the death of the ""Roi Soleil"", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer of French opera and the leading French composer for the harpsichord.[381][full citation needed] French composers played an important role during the music of the 19th and early 20th century, which is considered to be the Romantic music era. Romantic music emphasised a surrender to nature, a fascination with the past and the supernatural, the exploration of unusual, strange and surprising sounds, and a focus on national identity. This period was also a golden age for operas. French composers from the Romantic era included: Hector Berlioz (best known for his Symphonie fantastique), Georges Bizet (best known for Carmen, which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas), Gabriel Fauré (best known for his Pavane, Requiem, and nocturnes), Charles Gounod (best known for his Ave Maria and his opera Faust), Jacques Offenbach (best known for his 100 operettas of the 1850s–1870s and his uncompleted opera The Tales of Hoffmann), Édouard Lalo (best known for his Symphonie espagnole for violin and orchestra and his Cello Concerto in D minor), Jules Massenet (best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty, the most frequently staged are Manon (1884) and Werther (1892)) and Camille Saint-Saëns (he has many frequently-performed works, including The Carnival of the Animals, Danse macabre, Samson and Delilah (Opera), Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and his Symphony No. 3). Later came precursors of modern classical music. Érik Satie was a key member of the early-20th-century Parisian avant-garde, best known for his Gymnopédies. Francis Poulenc's best known works are his piano suite Trois mouvements perpétuels (1919), the ballet Les biches (1923), the Concert champêtre (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera Dialogues des Carmélites (1957) and the Gloria (1959) for soprano, choir and orchestra. Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy are the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed.[382] Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of atonality. The two composers invented new musical forms[383][384][385][386] and new sounds. Ravel's piano compositions, such as Jeux d'eau, Miroirs, Le tombeau de Couperin and Gaspard de la nuit, demand considerable virtuosity. His mastery of orchestration is evident in the Rapsodie espagnole, Daphnis et Chloé, his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and his orchestral work Boléro (1928). More recently, the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Ohana, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Boulez contributed to the evolutions of contemporary classical music.[387] Serge Gainsbourg, one of the world's most influential popular musicians French music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music at the middle of the 20th century. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, French pop music, known as chanson française, has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are Édith Piaf, Georges Brassens, Léo Ferré, Charles Aznavour and Serge Gainsbourg.[388] Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries,[389] bands such as Noir Désir, Mano Negra, Niagara, Les Rita Mitsouko and more recently Superbus, Phoenix and Gojira,[390] or Shaka Ponk, have reached worldwide popularity. Daft Punk, pioneers of the French house movement Other French artists with international careers have been popular in several countries, most notably female singers Dalida, Mireille Mathieu, Mylène Farmer,[390] Alizée and Nolwenn Leroy,[391] electronic music pioneers Jean-Michel Jarre, Laurent Garnier and Bob Sinclar, later Martin Solveig and David Guetta. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), electronic duos Daft Punk, Justice and Air also reached worldwide popularity and contributed to the reputation of modern electronic music in the world.[390][392][393] Among current musical events and institutions in France, many are dedicated to classical music and operas. The most prestigious institutions are the state-owned Paris National Opera (with its two sites Palais Garnier and Opéra Bastille), the Opéra National de Lyon, the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, the Théâtre du Capitole in Toulouse and the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux. As for music festivals, there are several events organised, the most popular being Eurockéennes (a word play which sounds in French as ""European""), Solidays and Rock en Seine. The Fête de la Musique, imitated by many foreign cities, was first launched by the French Government in 1982.[394][395] Major music halls and venues in France include Le Zénith sites present in many cities and other places in Paris (Paris Olympia, Théâtre Mogador, Élysée Montmartre). Cinema Main article: Cinema of France A Palme d'Or from the Cannes Film Festival, one of the ""Big Three"" film festivals alongside the Venice Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival[396][397][398] Louis de Funès, often called ""France's favourite actor"", has played over 130 roles in film and over 100 on stage.[399] France has historical and strong links with cinema, with two Frenchmen, Auguste and Louis Lumière (known as the Lumière Brothers) credited with creating cinema in 1895.[400] The world's first female filmmaker, Alice Guy-Blaché, was also from France.[401] Several important cinematic movements, including the late 1950s and 1960s Nouvelle Vague, began in the country. It is noted for having a strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by the Government of France. France remains a leader in filmmaking, as of 2015[update] producing more films than any other European country.[402][403] The nation also hosts the Cannes Festival, one of the most important and famous film festivals in the world.[404][405] Apart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as Poland (Roman Polanski, Krzysztof Kieślowski, Andrzej Żuławski), Argentina (Gaspar Noé, Edgardo Cozarinsky), Russia (Alexandre Alexeieff, Anatole Litvak), Austria (Michael Haneke) and Georgia (Géla Babluani, Otar Iosseliani) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as Luc Besson, Jacques Tourneur or Francis Veber in the United States. Although the French film market is dominated by Hollywood, France is the only nation in the world where American films make up the smallest share of total film revenues, at 50%, compared with 77% in Germany and 69% in Japan.[406] French films account for 35% of the total film revenues of France, which is the highest percentage of national film revenues in the developed world outside the United States, compared to 14% in Spain and 8% in the UK.[406] France is in 2013 the 2nd exporter of films in the world after the United States.[407] France historically was the cultural center of the world,[299] although its dominant position has been surpassed by the United States. Today, France takes steps in protecting and promoting its culture, becoming a leading advocate of the cultural exception.[408] The nation succeeded in convincing all EU members to refuse to include culture and audiovisuals in the list of liberalised sectors of the WTO in 1993.[409] Moreover, this decision was confirmed in a voting in the UNESCO in 2005: the principle of ""cultural exception"" won an overwhelming victory with 198 countries voting for it and only 2 countries, the United States and Israel, voting against.[410] Fashion Main article: French fashion Chanel's headquarters on the Place Vendôme, Paris Fashion has been an important industry and cultural export of France since the 17th century, and modern ""haute couture"" originated in Paris in the 1860s. Today, Paris, along with London, Milan, and New York City, is considered one of the world's fashion capitals, and the city is home or headquarters to many of the premier fashion houses. The expression Haute couture is, in France, a legally protected name, guaranteeing certain quality standards. The association of France with fashion and style (French: la mode) dates largely to the reign of Louis XIV[411] when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. But France renewed its dominance of the high fashion (French: couture or haute couture) industry in the years 1860–1960 through the establishing of the great couturier houses such as Chanel, Dior, and Givenchy. The French perfume industry is world leader in its sector and is centered on the town of Grasse.[412] In the 1960s, the elitist ""Haute couture"" came under criticism from France's youth culture. In 1966, the designer Yves Saint Laurent broke with established Haute Couture norms by launching a prêt-à-porter (""ready to wear"") line and expanding French fashion into mass manufacturing. With a greater focus on marketing and manufacturing, new trends were established by Sonia Rykiel, Thierry Mugler, Claude Montana, Jean-Paul Gaultier and Christian Lacroix in the 1970s and 1980s. The 1990s saw a conglomeration of many French couture houses under luxury giants and multinationals such as LVMH. According to 2017 data compiled by Deloitte, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LVMH), a French brand, is the largest luxury company in the world by sales, selling more than twice the amount of its nearest competitor.[413] Moreover, France also possesses 3 of the top 10 luxury goods companies by sales (LVMH, Kering SA, L'Oréal), more than any other country in the world.[413] Media Main article: Telecommunications in France The Parisian headquarters of Agence France-Presse, one of the world's oldest and leading news agencies[414] Best-selling daily national newspapers in France are Le Parisien Aujourd'hui en France (with 460,000 sold daily), Le Monde and Le Figaro, with around 300,000 copies sold daily, but also L'Équipe, dedicated to sports coverage.[415] In the past years, free dailies made a breakthrough, with Metro, 20 Minutes and Direct Plus distributed at more than 650,000 copies respectively.[416] However, the widest circulations are reached by regional daily Ouest France with more than 750,000 copies sold, and the 50 other regional papers have also high sales.[417][418] The sector of weekly magazines is stronger and diversified with more than 400 specialized weekly magazines published in the country.[419] The most influential news magazines are the left-wing Le Nouvel Observateur, centrist L'Express and right-wing Le Point (more than 400.000 copies),[420] but the highest circulation for weeklies is reached by TV magazines and by women's magazines, among them Marie Claire and ELLE, which have foreign versions. Influential weeklies also include investigative and satirical papers Le Canard Enchaîné and Charlie Hebdo, as well as Paris Match. Like in most industrialized nations, the print media have been affected by a severe crisis in the past decade. In 2008, the government launched a major initiative to help the sector reform and become financially independent,[421][422] but in 2009 it had to give 600,000 euros to help the print media cope with the economic crisis, in addition to existing subsidies.[423] Le Figaro was founded in 1826; many of France's most prominent authors have written in its columns over the decades, and it is still considered a newspaper of record.[424] In 1974, after years of centralised monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agency ORTF was split into several national institutions, but the three already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations[425][426] remained under state-control. It was only in 1981 that the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory, ending state monopoly on radio.[426] French television was partly liberalized in the next two-decade with the creation of several commercial channels, mainly thanks to cable and satellite television. In 2005 the national service Télévision Numérique Terrestre introduced digital television all over the territory, allowing the creation of other channels. The four existing national channels are owned by state-owned consortium France Télévisions, funded by advertising revenue and TV licence fees. Public broadcasting group Radio France run five national radio stations. Among these public media are Radio France Internationale, which broadcasts programs in French all over the world, and Franco-German TV channel TV5 Monde. In 2006, the government created global news channel France 24. Long-established TV channels TF1 (privatized in 1987), France 2 and France 3 have the highest shares, while radio stations RTL, Europe 1 and state-owned France Inter are the least listened to. Society See also: Human rights in France and LGBT rights in France Sculpture of Marianne, a common national personification of the French Republic According to a BBC poll in 2010, based on 29,977 responses in 28 countries, France is globally seen as a positive influence in the world's affairs: 49% have a positive view of the country's influence, whereas 19% have a negative view.[427][428] The Nation Brand Index of 2008 suggested that France has the second best international reputation, only behind Germany.[429] A global opinion poll for the BBC saw France ranked the fourth most positively viewed nation in the world (behind Germany, Canada and the United Kingdom) in 2014.[430] According to a poll in 2011, the French were found to have the highest level of religious tolerance and to be the country where the highest proportion of the population defines its identity primarily in term of nationality and not religion.[431] As of 2011[update], 75% of French had a favourable view of the United States, making France one of the most pro-American countries in the world.[432] As of 2017[update], the favourable view of the United States had dropped to 46%.[433] In January 2010, the magazine International Living ranked France as ""best country to live in"", ahead of 193 other countries, for the fifth year running.[434] The OECD Better Life Index states that ""France performs well in many measures of well-being relative to most other countries in the Better Life Index.""[435] The French Revolution continues to permeate the country's collective memory. The tricolour flag of France,[436] the anthem ""La Marseillaise"", and the motto Liberté, égalité, fraternité, defined in Title 1 of the Constitution as national symbols, all emerged during the cultural ferment of the early revolution, along with Marianne, a common national personification. In addition, Bastille Day, the national holiday, commemorates the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789.[437] A common and traditional symbol of the French people is the Gallic rooster. Its origins date back to Antiquity, since the Latin word Gallus meant both ""rooster"" and ""inhabitant of Gaul"". Then this figure gradually became the most widely shared representation of the French, used by French monarchs, then by the Revolution and under the successive republican regimes as representation of the national identity, used for some stamps and coins.[438] French flags displayed on the Champs Elysées after France's victory at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The French Tricolore is enshrined in the French Constitution as the national emblem of the French Republic.[439] France is one of the world leaders of gender equality in the workplace: as of 2017, it has 36.8% of its corporate board seats held by women, which makes it the leader of the G20 for that metric;[440] and was ranked in 2019 by the World Bank as one of the only 6 countries in the world where women have the same work rights as men.[441] France is one of the most liberal countries in the world when it comes to LGBT rights: a 2020 Pew Research Center poll found that 86% of the French think that same-sex relationships should be accepted by society, one of the highest acceptance rates in the world (comparable to that of other Western European nations).[442] France legalized same-sex marriage and adoption in 2013.[443] The government has used its diplomatic clout to support LGBT rights throughout the world, notably in the United Nations.[444] In 2020, France was ranked 5th in the Environmental Performance Index (behind the United Kingdom), out of 180 countries ranked by Yale University in that study.[445] Being the host country of the 2015 Paris Climate Change Conference, the French government was instrumental in securing the 2015 Paris agreement, a success that has been credited to its ""openness and experience in diplomacy"".[446] Cuisine Main article: French cuisine French wines are usually made to accompany French cuisine. French cuisine is renowned for being one of the finest in the world.[447][448] According to the regions, traditional recipes are different, the North of the country prefers to use butter as the preferred fat for cooking, whereas olive oil is more commonly used in the South.[449] Moreover, each region of France has iconic traditional specialties: Cassoulet in the Southwest, Choucroute in Alsace, Quiche in the Lorraine region, Beef bourguignon in the Bourgogne, provençal Tapenade, etc. France's most renowned products are wines,[450] including Champagne, Bordeaux, Bourgogne, and Beaujolais as well as a large variety of different cheeses, such as Camembert, Roquefort and Brie. There are more than 400 different varieties.[451][452] A meal often consists of three courses, hors d'œuvre or entrée (introductory course, sometimes soup), plat principal (main course), fromage (cheese course) or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Hors d'œuvres could include terrine de saumon au basilic, lobster bisque, foie gras, French onion soup or a croque monsieur. The plat principal could include a pot au feu or steak frites. The dessert could be mille-feuille pastry, a macaron, an éclair, crème brûlée, mousse au chocolat, crêpes, or Café liégeois. Some French cheeses with fruits French cuisine is also regarded as a key element of the quality of life and the attractiveness of France.[434] A French publication, the Michelin guide, awards Michelin stars for excellence to a select few establishments.[453][454] The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on the success of a restaurant. By 2006, the Michelin Guide had awarded 620 stars to French restaurants, at that time more than any other country, although the guide also inspects more restaurants in France than in any other country (by 2010, Japan was awarded as many Michelin stars as France, despite having half the number of Michelin inspectors working there).[455][456] In addition to its wine tradition, France is also a major producer of beer and rum. The three main French brewing regions are Alsace (60% of national production), Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Lorraine. France produces rum via distilleries located on islands such as Reunion Island in the southern Indian Ocean. Sports Main article: Sport in France Starting in 1903, the Tour de France is the oldest and most prestigious of Grands Tours, and the world's most famous cycling race.[457] France hosts ""the world's biggest annual sporting event"", the Tour de France,[458] and other popular sports played in France include: football, judo, tennis,[459] rugby union[460] and pétanque. France has hosted events such as the 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups,[461] the 2007 Rugby World Cup,[462] and will host the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The country also hosted the 1960 European Nations' Cup, UEFA Euro 1984, UEFA Euro 2016 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. The Stade de France in Saint-Denis is France's largest stadium and was the venue for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2007 Rugby World Cup finals. Since 1903, France is famous for its 24 Hours of Le Mans sports car endurance race.[463] Several major tennis tournaments take place in France, including the Paris Masters and the French Open, one of the four Grand Slam tournaments. French martial arts include Savate and Fencing. Pierre de Coubertin, father of the modern Olympic Games France has a close association with the Modern Olympic Games; it was a French aristocrat, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who suggested the Games' revival, at the end of the 19th century.[464][465] After Athens was awarded the first Games, in reference to the Olympics' Greek origins, Paris hosted the second Games in 1900.[466] Paris was the first home of the International Olympic Committee, before it moved to Lausanne.[467] Since 1900, France has hosted the Olympics on 4 further occasions: the 1924 Summer Olympics, again in Paris[465] and three Winter Games (1924 in Chamonix, 1968 in Grenoble and 1992 in Albertville).[465] Similar to the Olympics, France introduced Olympics for the deaf people (Deaflympics) in 1924 with the idea of a French deaf car mechanic, Eugène Rubens-Alcais who paved the way to organise the inaugural edition of the Summer Deaflympics in Paris.[468] Both the national football team and the national rugby union team are nicknamed ""Les Bleus"" in reference to the team's shirt colour as well as the national French tricolour flag. Football is the most popular sport in France, with over 1,800,000 registered players, and over 18,000 registered clubs.[469] The football team is among the most successful in the world, with two FIFA World Cup victories in 1998 and 2018,[470] one FIFA World Cup second place in 2006,[471] and two UEFA European Championships in 1984[472] and 2000.[473] Zinedine Zidane was named the best European footballer of the past 50 years in a 2004 UEFA poll.[474] The top national football club competition is Ligue 1. France has produced some of the greatest players in the world, including three time FIFA World Player of the Year Zinedine Zidane, three time Ballon d'Or recipient Michel Platini, record holder for most goals scored at a World Cup Just Fontaine, first football player to receive the Légion d'honneur Raymond Kopa, and the record goalscorer for the French national team Thierry Henry.[475] The French Open, also called Roland-Garros, is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks between late May and early June at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris. It is the premier clay court tennis championship event in the world and the second of four annual Grand Slam tournaments.[476] Rugby union is popular, particularly in Paris and the southwest of France.[477] The national rugby union team has competed at every Rugby World Cup, and takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship.

Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform Welcome to the United Nations DESA Home SDGs HLPF States SIDS UN System Stakeholders Topics Partnerships Resources About Documents Input from World Water Council World Water Council The past two decades have witnessed unprecedented economic and social progress. Real incomes in low- and middle-income countries have doubled and poverty rates have halved. Two billion people have gained access to improved drinking water. Maternal mortality has dropped by nearly half, and the share of those who are malnourished has fallen by a third. Yet at the same time the number of people living in poverty has increased. This has been one of the greatest and most rapid transformations in human history; and water resources management has helped initiate much of this change. But these achievements have been accompanied by mounting pressure on our natural resources, especially water. Considering that water is key to all aspects of sustainable development--food security, health, poverty reduction, women’s empowerment, environmental protection, as well as sustaining economic growth in agriculture, industry, and energy generation, just to name a few--the World Water Council reached out to the 7th World Water Forum Implementation Roadmap Champions in order to provide strong inputs to the 2017 HLPF on behalf of the water community. The Roadmaps embody the strong determination of the global water community to implement collective actions on specific themes that move the global water agenda forward and continuously monitor progress. Together, they benefit from a strategic and comprehensive vision relative to various water related issues. The following contribution includes inputs provided by the following organizations: Programme Solidarité Eau (pS-Eau); AquaFed; International Water Association (IWA); Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); K-water; International Water Resources Association (IWRA); OECD Water Governance Initiative (WGI); International Network of Basin Organizations (INBO); United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); Women for Water Partnership (WfWP); International Network of Water Training Centers (INWTC).

The founding members of WWEA are the national wind energy associations in many countries. The other members include consulting firms, scientific institutions, labs, academicians, students, wind energy enthusiasts, and equipment suppliers. Membership[edit] There are different membership categories: Ordinary members: wind energy associations Scientific members: scientific and research institutes Corporate members: companies and public bodies individual members WWEA has more than 600 members in more than 100 countries from all continents (as of November 2019). Organisational structure[edit] WWEA is governed by a board currently consisting of the President Peter Rae,[2] Australia, and Vice Presidents from all continents. A complete list of the WWEA board members which represent all continents can be found on the WWEA website www.wwindea.org. Headquarters[edit] The WWEA Head Office is situated in Bonn, close to the UN Campus, managed by the Secretary-General Stefan Gsänger. International policy debate[edit] WWEA is the voice supporting wind energy and other renewables at energy conferences and in the media around the world. WWEA statements like the WWEC resolutions have been taken up in international discussions and are guiding political decision-makers. WWEA also participated in the International Conference for Renewable Energies Renewables 2004 (Bonn, June 2004) and BIREC Beijing International Renewable Energy Conference 2005. WWEA has been granted Special Consultative Status at the United Nations in the year 2007, has been accredited at the UNFCCC and cooperates with organizations like UNEP, UNESCO, UNDESA, the IEA and the World Bank. Since 2003, it has supported the initiative to establish an International Renewable Energy Agency IRENA which was founded in Bonn on 26 January 2009. WWEA is a founding member of International Renewable Energy Alliance (IREA), consisting of the International Hydropower Association (IHA), the International Solar Energy Society (ISES), the International Geothermal Association (IGA) and since June 2009 the World Bioenergy Association (WBA). WWEA cooperates with other international renewable energy organizations; for example, it is represented at the Steering Committee of the REN21 global policy network and is a member of the World Council for Renewable Energy (WCRE). World Wind Energy Conferences (WWEC)[edit] WWEA organises World Wind Energy Conferences and Exhibitions (WWECs) in a different continent every year. WWECs have been held in Berlin (Germany) in 2002, Cape Town (South Africa) in 2003, and Beijing (China) in 2004. The 3rd WWEC in Beijing was attended by over 2000 participants thus becoming the biggest wind event ever held outside the EU and the US. The 4th WWEC took place in Melbourne (Australia). The 5th WWEC in New Delhi, India, from 6–8 November 2006, had the participation of nearly 2000 delegates from all over the world. The 6th WWEC took place in Mar del Plata, ARGENTINA in October 2007, jointly organised by Argentine Wind Energy Association (AAEE) and WWEA (see www.wwec2007.org) The 7th Special Topic ""Community Power"" WWEC took place in Kingston, Ontario, CANADA, in June 2008, jointly organised by Ontario Sustainable Energy Association OSEA, St Lawrence College, Kingston (SLC) and WWEA (see www.wwec2008.com) The WWEC2009 was organised together with the Korean Wind Energy Association on Jeju Island, South Korea, from 23 to 25 June 2009. The WWEC2010 was held in Istanbul/Turkey from 15 to 17 June 2010 under the theme ""Large-scale integration of wind power"". The WWEC2011 was held in Cairo/Egypt from 31 October to 2 November 2011 under the theme ""Greening Energy: Converting Deserts into Power Houses"". (www.wwec2011.net) The WWEC2012 was held in Bonn/Germany from 3 to 5 July 2012 under the theme ""Community Power – Citizens' Power"". (www.wwec2012.net) The WWEC2013 was held in Havana, Cuba from 3 to 5 June 2013 under the theme ""Opening Doors to Caribbean Winds"" The WWEC2014 was held in Shanghai, China, from 7 to 9 April 2014, under the theme ""Distributed Generation: Matching supply and demand"" The WWEC2015 was held in Jerusalem, from 26 to 28 October 2015, under the theme ""Innovation for 100% Renewable Energy"" The WWEC2016 was held in Tokyo, from 31 October to 2 November 2016. WWEC2017 was held in Malmo, Sweden in June 2017. These conferences have had a far-reaching impact on the Wind Energy Policy landscape of the respective countries. China embarked upon its wind energy program after WWEC 2004 held in Beijing and today (2013) the country is leading in wind energy installations. The conference in India in 2006 had extraordinary global participation and was addressed by the then President of India Honorable Dr. A P J Kalam. WWEC 2006 also included a Painting Competition having the participation of School Children from all over Delhi. This contributed to raising the level of awareness about wind energy among school-going children. The WWEC2008 in Kingston achieved the first feed-in tariff legislation in North America, the Green Energy Act of Ontario.

For the WorldWatch comic book, see Chuck Austen. The Worldwatch Institute was a globally focused environmental research organization based in Washington, D.C., founded by Lester R. Brown.[1] Worldwatch was named as one of the top ten sustainable development research organizations by Globescan Survey of Sustainability Experts. Brown left to found the Earth Policy Institute in 2000. The Institute was wound up in 2017, after publication of its last State of the World Report. Worldwatch.org was unreachable from mid 2019.[2] A Twitter feed remains as of 2021.[3] Contents 1 Mission 2 History 3 Publications 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Mission[edit] The mission of the Institute read: ""Through research and outreach that inspire action, the Worldwatch Institute works to accelerate the transition to a sustainable world that meets human needs. The Institute's top mission objectives are universal access to renewable energy and nutritious food, expansion of environmentally sound jobs and development, transformation of cultures from consumerism to sustainability, and an early end to population growth through healthy and intentional childbearing.""[4] The Worldwatch Institute aimed to inform policymakers and the public about the links between the world economy and its environmental support systems. Research conducted by the institute was integrative or interdisciplinary and global in scope.[5] Worldwatch's priority programs included: Building a low-carbon energy system that dramatically reduces the use of fossil fuels and lowers greenhouse gas emissions.[6] Nourishing the Planet - methods that create a sustainable food production system that provides a healthy, nutritious diet for all while sustaining the land, water, and biological resources on which life depends. The project resulted in the Worldwatch Institute's flagship publication, State of the World 2011: Innovations that Nourish the Planet.[7][8] Transforming economies, cultures, and societies that meets human needs, promotes prosperity, and is in harmony with nature.[9] Worldwatch also monitors human health, population, water resources, biodiversity, governance, and environmental security.[10] History[edit] 1974—The institute was founded by Lester Brown.[11] 1975—The first Worldwatch Paper was published. 1984—First State of the World published.[12] 1988—World Watch Magazine was launched. 1992—Vital Signs, Worldwatch's third annual series, was premiered. 2000—Christopher Flavin became President of Worldwatch in October. 2000 Lester R. Brown left, to found the Earth Policy Institute in 2001. 2008—Worldwatch hosted the 20th Anniversary of the James E. Hansen hearings. 2010.

77,"Worldwatch Institute - Wikipedia Worldwatch Institute From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search ""Worldwatch"" redirects here. For the WorldWatch comic book, see Chuck Austen. The Worldwatch Institute was a globally focused environmental research organization based in Washington, D.C., founded by Lester R. Brown.[1] Worldwatch was named as one of the top ten sustainable development research organizations by Globescan Survey of Sustainability Experts. Brown left to found the Earth Policy Institute in 2000. The Institute was wound up in 2017, after publication of its last State of the World Report. Worldwatch.org was unreachable from mid 2019.[2] A Twitter feed remains as of 2021.[3] Contents 1 Mission 2 History 3 Publications 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Mission[edit] The mission of the Institute read: ""Through research and outreach that inspire action, the Worldwatch Institute works to accelerate the transition to a sustainable world that meets human needs. The Institute's top mission objectives are universal access to renewable energy and nutritious food, expansion of environmentally sound jobs and development, transformation of cultures from consumerism to sustainability, and an early end to population growth through healthy and intentional childbearing.""[4] The Worldwatch Institute aimed to inform policymakers and the public about the links between the world economy and its environmental support systems. Research conducted by the institute was integrative or interdisciplinary and global in scope.[5] Worldwatch's priority programs included: Building a low-carbon energy system that dramatically reduces the use of fossil fuels and lowers greenhouse gas emissions.[6] Nourishing the Planet - methods that create a sustainable food production system that provides a healthy, nutritious diet for all while sustaining the land, water, and biological resources on which life depends. The project resulted in the Worldwatch Institute's flagship publication, State of the World 2011: Innovations that Nourish the Planet.[7][8] Transforming economies, cultures, and societies that meets human needs, promotes prosperity, and is in harmony with nature.[9] Worldwatch also monitors human health, population, water resources, biodiversity, governance, and environmental security.[10] History[edit] 1974—The institute was founded by Lester Brown.[11] 1975—The first Worldwatch Paper was published. 1984—First State of the World published.[12] 1988—World Watch Magazine was launched. 1992—Vital Signs, Worldwatch's third annual series, was premiered. 2000—Christopher Flavin became President of Worldwatch in October. 2000 Lester R. Brown left, to found the Earth Policy Institute in 2001. 2008—Worldwatch hosted the 20th Anniversary of the James E. Hansen hearings. 2010. July/August edition of World Watch magazine was the last.[13] 2011—Robert Engelman became President of Worldwatch in October. 2014—Ed Groark became Acting Interim President of Worldwatch. 2017 Ceased operations after its last State of the World report was published. Publications[edit] Worldwatch Institute publications have been published in more than three dozen languages by its global partners in 40 countries.[14] Worldwatch publications include: The State of the World report is an annual assessment of urgent global environmental problems and the innovative ideas proposed and applied across the globe to address them.[15] Vital Signs tracks social, environmental and economic trends and publishes data and analysis.[16] See also[edit] Lester R.

The organisation's activities are centred on developing transformation processes aimed at shaping a climate-friendly and resource-efficient world. The overriding goal of the Institute's work is to help to respect the planetary boundaries. This is represented in the guiding vision of a ""climate-neutral and resource light society"" by 2050. Show contentAlways show external content from youtube-nocookie.com External contentFor data protection reasons, this content fromyoutube-nocookie.comis only displayed after explicit consent. The following are key characteristics of the Institute's research. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinaryBuilding on the foundations of traditional scientific work, focused on individual disciplines, an interdisciplinary approach is taken to addressing sustainability problems. The Institute pursues science on a transdisciplinary basis: rather than being merely an observer, the scientific community plays an active part in the transformation processes. Transformative research (transition research) and work in real-world laboratories constitute the Institute's conceptual framework. Stakeholder-orientedThe Wuppertal Institute's research projects focus on the stakeholders who are actively involved on the ground and are usually conducted in close cooperation with them. The Institute sees itself as an intermediary between the worlds of science, industry and politics. Therefore, it takes the future application of its research into consideration in order to ensure that the findings are of great practical benefit to decision makers. InnovativeAll of the Institute's research projects are highly innovative. Its work is also concerned with analysing the effectiveness of innovations in regards to achieving the climate protection and resource efficiency goals. Innovations that facilitate systemic advances (next-level innovation) are of particular interest. They would appear to be essential to achieving the core Sustainable Development Goals in good time; however, they are often associated with intentional and sometimes unintentional structural changes. IntegrativeThe research carried out by the Wuppertal Institute is integrative in many respects. On the one hand, it takes a holistic approach by interlinking climate, energy and resource objectives. Economic and institutional considerations are combined with cultural and social concerns. On the other hand, the Institute's activities are multiscale, meaning that it performs analyses at micro (local level, individual businesses, households), meso (regional level, industries and associations) and macro levels (national, European and global analyses). Front of the Dürer-Haus (Photo: LarsLangemeier.de) This comprehensive, integrative approach is characteristic of the Wuppertal Institute's identity as well as being its USP when it comes to sustainability research. This concept of integration has five core dimensions that play a defining role for the Institute and its work and have been consistently developed in terms of content and methodology in recent years:Integrating core transformation arenas for sustainable development 	In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, very significant changes are needed in some areas (""transitions""). The Wuppertal Institute researches the challenges of transformation in the core arenas and looks in particular at the interplay between them. Its work is primarily focused on analysing the possible ways of designing the transition of energy, transport and industrial systems as well as the urban transition. For this purpose, the Institute has developed system models that facilitate greater understanding of cross-sectoral change processes. 	 Zukunftskunst – integrating various aspects of the way transformation processes are designed 	Transformation processes in favour of sustainable development emerge through a multifaceted interplay between technological innovations, economic conditions, institutional and political governance and cultural embedding. The latter expressly encompasses the social aspect and thus also questions of social acceptance and involvement/participation. This interplay is key to the successful design of transformation processes. The Wuppertal Institute has termed this interplay ""Zukunftskunst"" (future literacy) and has established a high degree of interdisciplinary expertise in its work, allowing it to reflect all the relevant aspects in the areas covered by its research. 	 Future knowledge – integrating different forms of knowledge 	In line with the concept of the transition cycle, research into and participation in the development of societal change processes by policymakers, civil society and business are dependent on three forms of knowledge: system knowledge, target knowledge and transformation knowledge. The Wuppertal Institute – together with partners from the worlds of science and industry – generates knowledge in all three areas and refers to the interplay between the three forms of knowledge as ""future knowledge"" (Zukunftswissen). The Institute therefore sees itself as a pioneer in the ongoing development of the methodology used in transdisciplinary and transformative research of this kind. Consequently, the Institute has played a decisive role in shaping concepts including ""transformative science"" and ""real-world laboratories"" in recent years. 	 Multilevel governance – integrating stakeholders and stakeholder levels 	Change processes in favour of sustainable development also require particular attention at governance level. This includes local, regional, national and international levels, because change processes generally necessitate interaction between all levels and stakeholders, from the transition in the energy and transport systems through to shifts in consumption patterns. Through its transdisciplinary research, the Wuppertal Institute therefore cooperates closely with stakeholders at all these levels and both incorporates and interlinks their perspectives and scope for action. It is only by taking this multilevel approach to governance that ideas for integrative solutions can be developed with due consideration for synergy potential as well as areas of conflict between the various levels. 	 Integrating and exchanging expertise and experience 	As one of the world's major urban and industrial metropolitan areas, the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) faces particular transformational challenges. Experience in the development of successful transformation strategies is thus highly relevant to the sustainability debate at international level. The Wuppertal Institute works closely with the NRW state government on this subject – on the one hand actively assisting in the development of potential solutions and, on the other, compiling empirical knowledge. In this respect, the structural change brought about by the transformation processes is particularly important, as are the possibilities of providing proactive support. As an international think tank, the Wuppertal Institute draws upon the implementation experience gained in other regions of the world and analyses the extent to which this experience can be transferred to NRW.

80,"Research institute - Wikipedia Research institute From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Research Institute) Jump to navigation Jump to search Establishment endowed for doing research A research institute, research centre, or research center is an establishment founded for doing research. Research institutes may specialize in basic research or may be oriented to applied research. Although the term often implies natural science research, there are also many research institutes in the social science as well, especially for sociological and historical research purposes. Contents 1 Famous research institutes 2 Research institutes in Europe 3 Scientific research in twentieth century America 3.1 1900–1939 3.2 1940 onward 4 Notable research centres 5 See also 6 Footnotes Famous research institutes[edit] In the early medieval period, several astronomical observatories were built in the Islamic world. The first of these was the 9th-century Baghdad observatory built during the time of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun, though the most famous were the 13th-century Maragheh observatory, and the 15th-century Ulugh Beg Observatory.[1] The Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics was a school of mathematics and astronomy founded by Madhava of Sangamagrama in Kerala, India. The school flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries and the original discoveries of the school seems to have ended with Narayana Bhattathiri (1559–1632). In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently discovered a number of important mathematical concepts. The earliest research institute in Europe was Tycho Brahe's Uraniborg complex on the island of Hven, a 16th-century astronomical laboratory set up to make highly accurate measurements of the stars. In the United States there are numerous notable research institutes including Bell Labs, Xerox Parc, The Scripps Research Institute,[2] Beckman Institute, and SRI International. Hughes Aircraft used a research institute structure for its organizational model.[3] Thomas Edison, dubbed ""The Wizard of Menlo Park"",[4] was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention in the late 1800s, and because of that, he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.[5] Research institutes in Europe[edit] From the throes of the Scientific Revolution came the 17th century scientific academy. In London, the Royal Society was founded in 1660, and in France Louis XIV founded the Académie royale des sciences in 1666 which came after private academic assemblies had been created earlier in the seventeenth century to foster research. . In the early 18th century Peter the Great established an educational-research institute to be built in his newly created imperial capital, St Petersburg. His plan combined provisions for linguistic, philosophical and scientific instruction with a separate academy in which graduates could pursue further scientific research. It was the first institution of its kind in Europe to conduct scientific research within the structure of a university. The St Petersburg Academy was established by decree on 28 January 1724.[6] The Lammi Biological Research Center in Hämeenlinna, Finland At the European level, there are now several government-funded institutions such as the European Space Agency (ESA), the nuclear research centre CERN, the European Southern Observatory ESO (Grenoble), the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) (Grenoble), the EUMETSAT facility, the Italian -European Sistema Trieste with, among others, the International Centre for Theoretical Physics and the research complex Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste, the biology project EMBL, and the fusion projects ITER and Wendelstein 7-X, which in addition to technical developments have a strong research focus. Scientific research in twentieth century America[edit] See also: Research I university Research institutes came to emerge at the beginning of the twentieth century. In 1900, at least in Europe and the United States, the scientific profession had only evolved so far as to include the theoretical implications of science and not its application. Research scientists had yet to establish a leadership in expertise. Outside scientific circles it was generally assumed that a person in an occupation related to the sciences carried out work which was necessarily ""scientific"" and that the skill of the scientist did not hold any more merit than the skill of a labourer. A philosophical position on science was not thought by all researchers to be intellectually superior to applied methods. However any research on scientific application was limited by comparison. A loose definition attributed all naturally occurring phenomena to ""science"". The growth of scientific study stimulated a desire to reinvigorate the scientific discipline by robust research in order to extract ""pure"" science from such broad categorisation.[7] 1900–1939[edit] This began with research conducted autonomously away from public utility and governmental supervision. Enclaves for industrial investigations became established. These included the Rockefeller Institute, Carnegie Institution of Washington and the Institute for Advanced Study. Research was advanced in both theory and application. This was aided by substantial private donation.[7] 1940 onward[edit] As of 2006, there were over 14,000 research centres in the United States.[8] The expansion of universities into the faculty of research fed into these developments as mass education produced mass scientific communities. A growing public consciousness of scientific research brought public perception to the fore in driving specific research developments. After the Second World War and the atom bomb specific research threads were followed: environmental pollution and national defence.[7] Notable research centres[edit] Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics Ames Research Center Bell Labs Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering Marine Sciences Research Center Palo Alto Research Center Thomas J.

86,"WWE Network - Wikipedia WWE Network From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search WWE produced subscription network WWE NetworkScreenshotType of siteOTT video streaming platformArea servedWorldwide (excluding Mainland China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Liechtenstein, Libya and Sudan)PresidentVince McMahonParentWWEURLnetwork.wwe.com RegistrationRequiredUsers 1.5 million (as of October 30, 2020[update])LaunchedFebruary 24, 2014; 7 years ago (February 24, 2014)Current statusActive (outside United States) WWE Network is an American subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service and digital television network owned by WWE. It primarily distributes original professional wrestling events, films, television and documentary series, and a 24-hour linear channel produced by the eponymous wrestling promotion, alongside acquired programming from other wrestling promotions. WWE Network relied on technology developed by MLB Advanced Media and BAMTech, prior to Endeavor Streaming assuming technical operations of the service in 2019. Although operating primarily as a standalone service, the distribution model of the WWE Network varies by market, where it is often integrated within or as part of local networks. It contains a premium and a free tier. WWE Network was launched on February 24, 2014, in the United States, in Canada in July of that year, and expanded to the Pacific and select European countries in August. The United Kingdom received the service in January 2015, and was made available in the Middle East and parts of Africa that March, and to India in November. It was launched in additional European and Asian countries in January 2016. Upon launch, the WWE Network was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. The service had 1.5 million subscribers as of October 30, 2020. In January 2021, NBCUniversal Television and Streaming acquired exclusive rights to distribute the WWE Network in the United States, and the American version of the service was integrated into the premium tier of its service Peacock, with the original service discontinued on April 4. Contents 1 History 1.1 Development and U.S. launch 1.2 Expansion 1.3 Switch to Endeavor, redesign 1.4 Merger of U.S. service into Peacock 2 Availability 3 Programming 3.1 Original programming 3.1.1 WWE events 3.1.2 Current shows 3.1.3 Former shows 3.2 Collections 3.3 Repeat/archival programming 3.3.1 Pay-per-views 3.3.2 WWF/WWE home video 3.3.3 WWWF/WWF/WWE programming 3.3.4 JCP/WCW programming 3.3.5 ECW programming 3.3.6 Other promotions 3.3.7 Non-wrestling content 3.4 Independent wrestling content 3.5 Removed content 4 Impact on pay-per-view industry 5 Advertising 6 Notes 7 References 8 External links History[edit] Development and U.S. launch[edit] The origins of the WWE Network can trace back to 2000 when USA Network filed the lawsuit against the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as the WWE) due to breach of contract which saw most of its programming moved to Viacom-owned TNN and MTV. The Delaware Chancery Court ruled in favor of the WWF in June 2000.[1][2] Then CEO Linda McMahon revealed that WWF wanted its own cable network and testified that before WWF signed a rights deal with Viacom, the company had floated the idea of acquiring USA's Sci-Fi Channel, and reformatting it as a dedicated wrestling network. USA executives rejected the idea, and McMahon said that former USA Networks President Barry Baker encouraged her to talk to other programmers about potential deals. ""I can tell you right now, Linda, you're not going to get anybody to give you a network,"" McMahon testified.[1] In 2005, USA Network re-acquired the rights to all WWE programming. In September 2011, WWE officially announced plans to launch the WWE Network in 2012 as a pay-TV channel.[3] WWE then conducted a survey asking people if they would pay for the WWE Network if it were a premium channel. In an email sent to WWE fans who might be interested in the WWE Network, WWE surveyed fans for their thoughts about the WWE Network airing WWE's pay-per-views to subscribers for no additional charge. The survey also noted that feature repeats of Raw and SmackDown, as well as footage from World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), XFL, Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW), American Wrestling Association (AWA), and WWE films would also make the lineup. Original programming was also noted in the survey.[4][5] As the result of an online poll, WrestleMania Recap was chosen as a name for a new WWE Network show on October 17, 2011.[6] The original launch date was set for April 1, 2012, which would have coincided with WrestleMania XXVIII, and WWE's official website featured a countdown clock that would have expired on April 1. The clock was quietly removed, and the network did not launch as advertised.[7] WWE chief marketing officer Michelle Wilson allayed fears about the future of the WWE Network, saying ""There will be a WWE network in some shape or form. We are in late-stage negotiations with distributors"", and confirmed that WWE Legends' House had been filmed.[8] In April 2013, WWE had switched plans and aimed to release the WWE Network as a premium pay-TV outlet, with a potential price of $15 a month.[9] On Old School Raw in January 2014, WWE ran teasers promoting an announcement on January 8 at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas,[10] later confirming that the announcement concerned the WWE Network.[11] At the Consumer Electronics Show, WWE revealed a comprehensive plan which would see a launch date of February 24, 2014 in the United States.[12][13][14] WWE Classics on Demand closed on January 31, 2014 to make way for the WWE Network.[15] A free trial period was offered during the week of the launch.[16] The logo initially used for the WWE Network eventually became the standard logo used by the WWE corporation in August 2014.[17] In April 2014, ahead of WrestleMania XXX, the Network received acclaim, with The New York Times saying that WWE had ""positioned themselves on the cutting edge of Internet television.""[18] Later that month, the company announced that the network had 667,000 subscribers, short of the one million subscribers they needed to break even.[19] As WWE's stock fell 50% the following month, Forbes described low subscription numbers as being of ""additional concern"" for investors after WWE's underwhelming NBCUniversal renewal deal.[20] WWE offered a second free preview week of the WWE Network, which started July 7, in an attempt to sign new subscribers.[21] A second report released at the end of July indicated that the network had reached 700,000 subscribers.[22] WWE's goal was to reach one million subscribers by the end of 2014.[22][23] Expansion[edit] On July 31, 2014, the company announced a 10-year, Canadian distribution deal for WWE content with Rogers Media (owner of Sportsnet 360, the historic carrier of WWE programming in Canada), which will see the company distribute WWE Network as a premium television service.[24] Also on that date, it was announced that the WWE Network would launch in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mexico, Spain, and the Nordics, among others on August 12, with Italian, Arab, German, Japanese, Indian, Chinese, Thai, and Malaysian launches planned for a later date.[25][26][27] On October 30, 2014, in an attempt to increase subscription numbers from an announced figure of 731,000, the 6-month subscription requirement was dropped, allowing subscribers the option to cancel at any time.[28][29] WWE had originally planned to launch the network on October 1 in the United Kingdom, but was delayed for a further month.[30] The launch was confirmed to be taking place at 8 p.m. on November 3;[31] however, 20 minutes prior to the launch, WWE announced that it had been indefinitely delayed.[32][33] Vince McMahon publicly apologized for the delay.[34] It was announced on January 4, 2015, that the WWE Network would be launching in the UK and Ireland on January 19, 2015, priced at £9.99 and €12.99, respectively,[35] although some customers managed to register as early as January 13.[36][37][38] On January 27, 2015, WWE announced that the WWE Network had reached 1 million subscribers,[39] with Vince McMahon saying that WWE would ""remain focused on delivering an outstanding value proposition for ours fans by adding new content and new features in the coming year.""[40] On February 12, 2015, WWE announced a five-year partnership with television provider OSN to bring the WWE Network to the Middle East and North Africa as a premium service.[41] On July 30, 2015, WWE revealed the number of subscribers for the Network at 1.156 million. This was announced as a part of WWE's financial reporting on the second quarter of the year, which had resulted in their stock price rising past $20.00 after closing on the previous day at $16.48. The total of 1.156 million paid subscribers marked a 13% decrease from the 1.315 million paid subscribers that was stated in the reports for the first quarter of 2015. WWE also revealed, including trial subscribers, they had 1.227 million Network users at the end of the second quarter, and over the entire lifespan of the Network, there have been over 2 million unique subscribers.[42] The WWE Network launched in India on November 2, 2015.[43][44] On November 19, a report by market research and consulting firm Park Associates announced that the WWE Network had broken into the top five streaming services and trailed only MLB.tv in the sports category.[45] The WWE announced the network would launch in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Japan on January 5, 2016,[46][47] followed by Thailand and the Philippines on February 29, 2016.[48] In April 2017, WWE announced a total of 1.949 million subscribers to the WWE Network, of which 1.661 million were paid subscribers.[49] At the end of the third quarter of 2017, the number had dropped to 1.5 million paid users.[50] In April 2018, WWE announced subscriber growth had reached 2.1 million, with 1.8 million paid.[51] At the end of the third quarter of 2018 the number had dropped to 1.6 million paid users.[50] Switch to Endeavor, redesign[edit] In January 2019, WWE Network signed with Endeavor Streaming to replace BAMTech as its operating partner.[52] WWE's decision was motivated by the acquisition of BAMTech by Disney.[53] Co-president George Barrios cited concerns over how BAMTech's relationships with third-party partners would be impacted by the sale, while WWE also sought greater control over the service and its operations, intending to partner with another vendor or take the service entirely in-house. The company decided to partner with Endeavor Streaming (formed primarily from the assets of NeuLion) to provide infrastructure and billing services, and Massive Interactive to develop a new front-end and mobile apps.[54] The new WWE Network platform launched in July 2019, ahead of SummerSlam. It includes a revamped user experience, support for 1080p streams, new browsing tools (such as a new ""Superstars"" interface for filtering content by performers), and plans to add a download feature for offline viewing in the future. Support for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and selected legacy smart TVs was discontinued with the changeover.[54] In an interview with The Verge, Barrios revealed that there were ongoing plans for WWE.com's existing video content to be integrated into the WWE Network platform as a ""free"" tier (possibly also including previews of WWE Network's premium content), and that WWE was also considering the development of a premium tier with additional features (such as benefits for other WWE operations).[54] In March 2020, amid the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and to promote WrestleMania 36, WWE Network made a selection of its premium content and archives available free for a limited time.[55] On June 1, 2020, WWE Network officially launched a free tier with 15,000 hours of content, which includes access to selected content such as recent episodes of its weekly programming, and original series such as Raw Talk, Monday Night War, and Ride Along. The service would be advertising-free, and was intended primarily to promote its weekly programs and pay-per-view events.[56] Merger of U.S. service into Peacock[edit] On January 25, 2021, WWE announced that NBCUniversal Television and Streaming had acquired the exclusive U.S. distribution rights to WWE Network, and that the service would be folded into the NBCUniversal-owned streaming service Peacock on March 18, 2021 (ahead of Fastlane and WrestleMania 37). Existing and future WWE Network content will be hosted by a branded channel within the Peacock service, with the full service included as part of the paid Peacock Premium tier (which features a wider array of television, film, and sports programming), and a selection of WWE Network content (including some of its original series such as The Bump and Raw Talk, and episodes of Total Divas and Total Bellas from NBCUniversal cable channel E!) available within its free tier.[57] WWE committed to produce a ""signature documentary"" for the service annually beginning in 2022.[58] After a transitional period, the standalone WWE Network ceased operations in the United States on April 4, 2021.[57][59] Not all content was available at launch, as the service's library is being audited to meet NBCUniversal standards and practices. WWE stated that the content migration would be completed by August 2021.[60] To coincide with the introduction, Peacock announced plans to offer a four-month half-price promotion for new Premium subscribers.[57][59] This agreement did not affect the service outside of the United States, which continues to be marketed as a standalone offering through either WWE or its local partners.[58][61] Availability[edit] Availability of the WWE Network globally   Available   Unavailable   No information The WWE Network is currently available through 186 out of 193 United Nations member states (including all 27 European Union nations) and two observer states such as the Holy See and the State of Palestine. It is also distributed through six non-UN countries: the Republic of China (Taiwan), the Cook Islands, Kosovo, Niue, Northern Cyprus and SADR-claimed Western Sahara. In late 2017, Liechtenstein and China were added to the list of non-available countries,[62] however the WWE Network is still available in the Chinese special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau as well as ROC-controlled Taiwan and Fujian.

Although the United States parental guidelines rating system rates most weekly WWE television programs TV-PG, the WWE Network broadcasts a wider range of content. A parental controls block is available and content rated TV-14 and TV-MA are preceded by an advisory warning. The network airs footage featuring Chris Benoit; it marks the first major airing of Benoit footage or even mention of Benoit in said footage since his murder-suicide in 2007.[92] However, the Benoit tribute episode of Raw is replaced with the episode that aired internationally, a recap of championship matches. Also, Vengeance: Night of Champions in 2007 removes all references to Benoit during the ECW World Championship match. Over the Edge 1999, infamous for Owen Hart's death at the event, is also available for the first time since its original air date; however, some portions of the event have been edited out of respect to the Hart family.[93] Matches called with Jesse Ventura on commentary, which had previously been dubbed over due to a 1991 lawsuit, are available with the original commentary.[94] While the network promoted on-demand airings as being unedited, some instances of expletives, gestures, and all nudity are censored. Many programs were digitized for WWE 24/7 prior to the 2012 settlement with the World Wide Fund for Nature, and thus the ""WWF"" and the ""WWF scratch"" logo are censored in some instances.[95][96] Some original music has been dubbed over with alternate tracks such as the original intro music to Saturday Night's Main Event (May 1985 – January 1988 episodes) which originally played ""Obsession"" by Animotion.[97] At launch, all but one of New Jack's matches were removed from ECW pay-per-views, as was his surprise return at Heat Wave 1998, due to a combination of musical rights issues over his entrance music and the inability to remove the music without losing the original commentary audio. The deleted matches were eventually reinstated with replacement music and newly recorded Joey Styles commentary.[98] Several pay-per-views are copies of their condensed home video releases, rather than the live versions, and so are missing matches.[99] Archive content on the Peacock-hosted version of WWE Network is being further edited for content by NBCUniversal. On launch, two pay-per-views were edited to remove racially-insensitive content; WrestleMania VI was edited to remove a match between Roddy Piper and Bad News Brown where Piper had painted half of his body black, and Survivor Series 2005 was edited to remove a backstage segment where Vince McMahon used a racial slur in front of Booker T and John Cena.[60] Pay-per-views[edit] Almost every WWF/WWE, JCP/WCW, and ECW pay-per-view (PPV) event ever produced is available for on-demand streaming.[94] Although WWE promotes the selection as every pay-per-view ever made, a handful of PPV events have not yet been made available.[100] This includes mostly foreign events such as WCW's Millennium Final, Collision in Korea, and the Japan Supershows, and ECW's foreign ECW/FMW Supershows, however it also includes some events held domestically such as WCW's Nitro Girls Swimsuit Calendar Special and When Worlds Collide, and WWF's No Holds Barred: The Match/The Movie.[a] In addition the pay-per-view section contains several events which did not air on pay-per-view, such as WWE events Royal Rumble 1988[101] and WWE Global Warning Tour: Melbourne.[102] Many ECW Supercards are also listed as pay-per-views, despite never actually airing there.[103] WWF/WWE home video[edit] The WWE released videos under the header ""Home video classics"" which include various previous home video releases that had been originally released under Coliseum Video.[104] Andre The Giant[105] Bashed in the USA[104] Battle Royal at the Albert Hall[104] Big, Small, Strange, Strong[104] Big Daddy Cool Diesel[106] Bloopers, Bleeps, and Bodyslams[104] Brains Behind the Brawn[104] Bret Hart: Greatest Matches[107] Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart[105] British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith[107] The British Bulldogs[106] Bruno Sammartino: Living Legend[108] Brutus The Barber Beefcake[106] Crunch Classic[104] Demolition[109] Euro Rampage '92[104] Funniest Moments[104] George 'The Animal' Steele[107] German Fan Favorites[106] Global Warfare[106] Global Warning Tour: Melbourne Grand Slams[104] Greatest Hits[104] Grudge Match '86[104] 'Hacksaw' Jim Duggan[107] The Hart Foundation[108] Hottest Matches[104] Hulk Hogan: Real American[108] The Hulkster Hulk Hogan[107] Inside the Steel Cage[104] Invasion '92[104] Invasion of the Bodyslammers[104] Jake The Snake Roberts[108] The Ken Patera Story[108] Life and Times: Capt.

Floyd Mayweather and Big Show documentary from 2014. Impact on pay-per-view industry[edit] In an interview with Time, Michelle D. Wilson, chief revenue and marketing officer for WWE, stated their reason for bypassing cable companies and instead only offering the WWE Network online: ""Digital over-the-top offerings represent the future, and given that our passionate fans consume five times more online video content than non-WWE viewers and over-index for purchasing online subscriptions such as Netflix and Hulu, we believe the time is now for a WWE Network.""[124] In response to the announcement, DirecTV issued a statement saying that they are re-evaluating whether to continue carrying WWE's pay-per-view events. Due to the fact that these events would also be available on the WWE Network once it launches, it might reduce the number of pay-per-view purchases via cable and satellite providers. Vince McMahon suggested that pay-TV operators would ultimately decide to continue to carry WWE's pay-per-view events, given that providers keep a significant share of each purchase, and incur minimal costs (apart from WWE's share of the fee for each purchase) to carry the events: ""It's found money for them.""[125] DirecTV later quietly dropped carriage of WWE PPVs. In response, WWE said, ""Yes, DIRECTV has decided to stop offering our PPV's residentially and commercially. The only other option would be to work through the local cable provider.""[126] On February 19, 2014, Dish Network announced that they would carry WWE pay-per-views on an event by event basis, beginning with Elimination Chamber. Dish Network later released a statement saying, ""Dish will not offer the ‘WWE Elimination Chamber’ PPV on 2/23. WWE is not willing to adjust their PPV costs to satellite and cable companies, which is unfair to their customers. We need to re-focus our efforts to support partners that better serve Dish customers.""[127] Dish later made a decision to air WrestleMania XXX.[128] Dish declined to offer WrestleMania 31 and 32 but did offer WrestleMania 33 in 2017.[129] Advertising[edit] In October 2014, it was reported Mattel, Kmart, and Pepsi would begin advertising on the network starting the week of October 13. Wilson stated that although no commercial breaks will occur during scheduled programming, 30 second adverts would run in between shows, and that one 15 or 30-second advert would be shown prior to every fourth stream of on-demand content.[130][131] Notes[edit] ^ The steel cage match from No Holds Barred: The Match/The Movie is available on the home video Supertape, which is available on the WWE Network.

Nature is being lost at a rate unprecedented in human history. Average global temperatures have risen by more than 1.0°C since pre-industrial times - dangerously close to breaching the critical 1.5 degree increase that would cause irreversible change. When it comes to nature loss and the climate crisis, there are no winners. Their impact will not only devastate wildlife and ecosystems - they will be felt (and are already being felt) by us no matter where we are in the world and in all areas of our lives, including sport. As the world sets its eyes on the Tokyo Olympics, let’s remind ourselves that we must protect and restore our planet if we are to continue the sports that we hold dear and bring us together. Here's what the Olympics of the future could look like if we don't: Healthy soil is disappearing from the surface of the Earth at a rate of 24 billion tons a year. Half of all the topsoil on our planet has already been lost in the last 150 years due to deforestation, overgrazing, unsustainable agriculture and land use, as well as the effects of pollution and the climate crisis. Healthy, functioning soil is not only home to almost 90% of living organisms in terrestrial ecosystems, but is relied on for the production of over 95% of our food and for freshwater for most of the world’s population. An estimated 9 out of 10 people globally breathe polluted air, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The small particles in polluted air which enter our lungs and bloodstream can cause diseases including stroke, heart disease, and lung cancer as well as respiratory infections like pneumonia. Research suggests that exposure to polluted air already causes over 7 million deaths each year - a number that will only increase if we continue to burn fossil fuels and waste, use diesel and gasoline to power vehicles, and destroy the forests that help clean our air. Eight million tonnes of plastic enter our ocean every year, and by 2050, there could be more plastic than fish in the sea. Plastics not only harm marine wildlife - they break down into tiny pieces called microplastics, small enough to enter our food chain. Research shows that the average person could be unknowingly ingesting around 5 grams of plastic every week, the equivalent weight of a credit card. The climate crisis is causing global sea levels to rise 2.5 times faster than in the last century. By 2050, as sea levels rise and fish stocks shift due to a warming ocean, one billion people who live in low-lying coastal areas will be at risk. By 2100, if we continue at the current rate, major cities - including Jakarta, Lagos, Houston, Venice, Bangkok, Dhaka, Rotterdam, and Miami - could be underwater. WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME TEAM There are things we can win, and there are things we must win. The battle against nature loss and the climate crisis can only be won we work together and make the protection of our planet a global priority. Over the next few months and into 2022, world leaders will be coming together to attend major United Nations policy conferences. Sign our Voice for the Planet petition to let them know that you care about the fate of our one home, urging them to step up their efforts to protect and restore our planet within the next decade.

WWF is the world's largest conservation organization, with over five million supporters worldwide, working in more than 100 countries and supporting around 3,000 conservation and environmental projects.[5] They have invested over $1 billion in more than 12,000 conservation initiatives since 1995.[6] WWF is a foundation with 55% of funding from individuals and bequests, 19% from government sources (such as the World Bank, DFID, and USAID) and 8% from corporations in 2014.[7][8] WWF aims to ""stop the degradation of the planet's natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.""[9] The Living Planet Report has been published every two years by WWF since 1998; it is based on a Living Planet Index and ecological footprint calculation.[4] In addition, WWF has launched several notable worldwide campaigns, including Earth Hour and Debt-for-nature swap, and its current work is organized around these six areas: food, climate, freshwater, wildlife, forests, and oceans.[4][6] WWF received criticism for its alleged corporate ties[10][11] and has been reprimanded for supporting eco-guards that hounded African forest dwellers in the proposed Messok Dja national park in the Republic of the Congo.[12] The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is part of the Steering Group of the Foundations Platform F20, an international network of foundations and philanthropic organizations.[13] Contents 1 History 1.1 Founding 1.2 Recent development 2 Panda symbol 3 Organization and operation 3.1 Policy-making 3.2 Collaboration 3.3 List of presidents 4 Notable initiatives and programs 4.1 Campaigns 4.2 Publications 4.3 Promotions 5 Controversies and disputes 5.1 ARD documentary and ""PandaLeaks"" book 5.2 Corporate partnerships 5.3 Human rights abuses by paramilitaries 5.4 Initialism dispute 5.5 Mekong River dolphins report 5.6 Accountability 5.7 Manipulation of CO2 emissions 6 Regional organisations 6.1 WWF-Australia 7 See also 8 References 9 External links History[edit] Founding[edit] Earth Hour 2013 at the Verona Arena amphitheatre, Piazza Bra, Verona, Italy before (top) and while the street lighting was switched off.The idea for a fund on behalf of endangered animals was officially proposed by Victor Stolan to Sir Julian Huxley in response to articles he published in the British newspaper The Observer. This proposal led Huxley to put Stolan in contact with Edward Max Nicholson, a person who had had thirty years experience of linking progressive intellectuals with big business interests through the Political and Economic Planning think tank.[1][14][15] Nicholson thought up the name of the organization and the original panda logo was designed by Sir Peter Scott. WWF was conceived on 29 April 1961, under the name of World Wildlife Fund. Its first office was opened on 11 September in IUCN's headquarters at Morges, Switzerland. The WWF was conceived to act as an international fundraising organisation to support the work of existing conservation groups, primarily the International Union for Conservation of Nature.[16] Its establishment was marked with the signing of the ""Morges Manifesto"", the founding document that sets out the fund's commitment to assisting worthy organizations struggling to save the world's wildlife:[17] They need above all money, to carry out mercy missions and to meet conservation emergencies by buying land where wildlife treasures are threatened, and in many other ways. Money, for example, to pay guardians of wildlife refuges .... Money for education and propaganda among those who would care and help if only they understood. Money to send out experts to danger spots and to train more local wardens and helpers in Africa and elsewhere. Money to maintain a sort of 'war room' at the international headquarters of conservation, showing where the danger spots are and making it possible to ensure that their needs are met before it is too late.— Morges ManifestoDutch Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld helped found the World Wildlife Fund, becoming its first President in 1961. In 1963, the Foundation held a conference and published a major report warning of anthropogenic global warming, written by Noel Eichhorn based on the work of Frank Fraser Darling (then foundation vice president), Edward Deevey, Erik Eriksson, Charles Keeling, Gilbert Plass, Lionel Walford, and William Garnett.[18] In 1970, along with Duke of Edinburgh and a few associates, Prince Bernhard established the WWF's financial endowment The 1001: A Nature Trust to handle the WWF's administration and fundraising. 1001 members each contributed $10,000 to the trust.[19] Prince Bernhard resigned his post after being involved in the Lockheed Bribery Scandal.[20] Recent development[edit] This section may rely excessively on sources too closely associated with the subject, potentially preventing the article from being verifiable and neutral.

(July 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The WWF has set up offices and operations around the world. It originally worked by fundraising and providing grants to existing non-governmental organizations with an initial focus on the protection of endangered species. As more resources became available, its operations expanded into other areas such as the preservation of biological diversity, sustainable use of natural resources, the reduction of pollution, and climate change. The organization also began to run its own conservation projects and campaigns.[citation needed] A WWF hot air balloon in Mexico (2013).In 1986, the organization changed its name to World Wide Fund for Nature, while retaining the WWF initials. However, it continued at that time to operate under the original name in the United States and Canada.[21] 1986 was the 25th anniversary of WWF's foundation, an event marked by a gathering in Assisi, Italy to which the organization's International President Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, invited religious authorities representing Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and Judaism. These leaders produced The Assisi Declarations, theological statements showing the spiritual relationship between their followers and nature that triggered a growth in the engagement of those religions with conservation around the world.[21] In the 1990s, WWF revised its mission statement to:[citation needed] Stop the degradation of the planet's natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature, conserving the world's biological diversity; ensuring that the use of renewable natural resources is sustainable; [and] promoting the reduction of pollution and wasteful consumption. WWF scientists and many others identified 238 ecoregions that represent the world's most biologically outstanding terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats, based on a worldwide biodiversity analysis which the organization says was the first of its kind.[22] In the early 2000s (decade), its work was focused on a subset of these ecoregions, in the areas of forest, freshwater and marine habitat conservation, endangered species conservation, climate change, and the elimination of the most toxic chemicals. We shan't save all we should like to, but we shall save a great deal more than if we had never tried.— Sir Peter Scott[19] In 1990, the Conservation Foundation was completely merged into WWF, after becoming an affiliate of WWF-US in 1985 when it became a distinct legal entity but with the same staff and board.[4] The organization now known as the Conservation Foundation in the United States is the former Forest Foundation of DuPage County.[16][23] In 1996, the organization obtained general consultative status from UNESCO.[citation needed] Harvard University published a case study on WWF called ""Negotiating Toward the Paris Accords: WWF & the Role of Forests in the 2015 Climate Agreement"":[24] Panda symbol[edit] This section may rely excessively on sources too closely associated with the subject, potentially preventing the article from being verifiable and neutral.

(July 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The giant panda has become the symbol of WWF. WWF's giant panda logo originated from a panda named Chi Chi that had been transferred from Beijing Zoo to London Zoo in 1958, three years before WWF became established. Being famous as the only panda residing in the Western world at that time, her uniquely recognisable physical features and status as an endangered species were seen as ideal to serve the organization's need for a strong recognisable symbol that would overcome all language barriers.[25] The organization also needed an animal that would have an impact in black and white printing. The logo was then designed by Sir Peter Scott from preliminary sketches by Gerald Watterson, a Scottish naturalist.[26][27] The logo was slightly simplified and made more geometric in 1978, and was revised significantly again in 1986, at the time that the organization changed its name, with the new version featuring solid black shapes for eyes.[28] In 2000 a change was made to the font used for the initials ""WWF"" in the logo.[29] Organization and operation[edit] Policy-making[edit] This section may rely excessively on sources too closely associated with the subject, potentially preventing the article from being verifiable and neutral.

(July 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Policies of the WWF are made by board members elected for three-year terms. An Executive Team guides and develops WWF's strategy. There is also a National Council which stands as an advisory group to the board and a team of scientists and experts in conservation who research for WWF. National and international law plays an important role in determining how habitats and resources are managed and used. Laws and regulations become one of the organization's global priorities. The WWF has been opposed to the extraction of oil from the Canadian tar sands and has campaigned on this matter. Between 2008 and 2010 the WWF worked with The Co-operative Group, the UK's largest consumer co-operative to publish reports which concluded that: (1) exploiting the Canadian tar sands to their full potential would be sufficient to bring about what they described as 'runaway climate change;[30] (2) carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology cannot be used to reduce the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to a level comparable to that of other methods of oil extraction;[31] (3) the $379 billion which is expected to be spent extracting oil from tar sands could be better spent on research and development in renewable energy technology;[32] and (4) the expansion of tar sands extraction poses a serious threat to the caribou in Alberta .[33] The organization convinces and helps governments and other political bodies to adopt, enforce, strengthen and/or change policies, guidelines and laws that affect biodiversity and natural resource use. It also ensures government consent and/or keeps their commitment to international instruments relating to the protection of biodiversity and natural resources.[34][35] In 2012, David Nussbaum, Chief Executive of WWF-UK, spoke out against the way shale gas is used in the UK, saying: ""... the Government must reaffirm its commitment to tackling climate change and prioritise renewables and energy efficiency.""[36] Collaboration[edit] This section may rely excessively on sources too closely associated with the subject, potentially preventing the article from being verifiable and neutral.

(July 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The organisation works on a number of global issues driving biodiversity loss and unsustainable use of natural resources, including species conservation, finance, business practices, laws, and consumption choices. Local offices also work on national or regional issues.[37] WWF works with a large number of different groups to achieve its goals, including other NGOs, governments, business, investment banks, scientists, fishermen, farmers and local communities. It also undertakes public campaigns to influence decision makers, and seeks to educate people on how to live in a more environmentally friendly manner. It urges people to donate funds to protect the environment. The donors can also choose to receive gifts in return.[citation needed] In October 2020, WWF was named as one of the alliance partner's of Prince William's Earthshot Prize, to find solutions to environmental issues.[38] In March 2021, WWF announced an extension of their partnership with H&M to address sustainable supply chain practices.[39] List of presidents[edit] Yolanda Kakabadse, WWF president from 2010 to 2017 Years[40] Name[40] 1961–1976 Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld 1976–1981 John Hugo Loudon 1981–1996 Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh 1996–1999 Syed Babar Ali 2000–2000 Ruud Lubbers 2000–2001 Sara Morrison 2001–2010 Chief Emeka Anyaoku 2010–2017 Yolanda Kakabadse 2018–present Pavan Sukhdev Notable initiatives and programs[edit] Campaigns[edit] Debt-for-Nature Swap Earth Hour Healthy Grown Marine Stewardship Council Publications[edit] This section may rely excessively on sources too closely associated with the subject, potentially preventing the article from being verifiable and neutral.

(July 2019) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) WWF publishes the Living Planet Index in collaboration with the Zoological Society of London. Along with ecological footprint calculations, the Index is used to produce a bi-yearly Living Planet Report giving an overview of the impact of human activity on the world.[41] In 2019, WWF and Knorr jointly published the Future 50 Foods report identifying ""50 Foods for Healthier People and a Healthier Planet"".[42] The organization also regularly publishes reports, fact sheets and other documents on issues related to its work, to raise awareness and provide information to policy and decision makers.[43] Promotions[edit] No One's Gonna Change Our World was a charity album released in 1969, for the benefit of the WWF.[44] Peter Rose and Anne Conlon are music theatre writers, well known for their environmental musicals for children, who were commissioned by WWF-UK to write several environmental musicals as part of an education plan.[45] Some were narrated by David Attenborough, and broadcast on television in numerous countries. The British pop group S Club 7 were ambassadors for WWF-UK during their time together as a band (1999-2003).[46] Each of the members sponsored an endangered animal, and in 2000, traveled to the various locations around the world of their chosen animals for a seven-part BBC documentary series entitled S Club 7 Go Wild. Environmentally Sound: A Select Anthology of Songs Inspired by the Earth is a benefit album released in 2006, for WWF-Philippines, featuring artists that included Up Dharma Down, Radioactive Sago Project, Kala, Johnny Alegre Affinity, Cynthia Alexander, and Joey Ayala.[47] In June 2012, WWF launched an online music download store with fairsharemusic from which 50% of the profit goes to the charity.[48] In April 2015, Hailey Gardiner released her solo EP, titled The Woods. In honor of Earth Day, 15% of the proceeds made towards the purchase of the EP would be donated to the WWF.[49] Controversies and disputes[edit] ARD documentary and ""PandaLeaks"" book[edit] The German public television ARD aired a documentary on 22 June 2011 that claimed to show how the WWF cooperates with corporations such as Monsanto, providing sustainability certification in exchange for donations – essentially greenwashing.[50] WWF has denied the allegations.[51] By encouraging high-impact eco-tourism, the program alleges that WWF contributes to the destruction of habitat and species it claims to protect while also harming indigenous peoples.[52] The filmmaker, Wilfried Huismann, was sued by the WWF over his documentary and the book ""Schwarzbuch WWF"" published in 2012, which was based on the documentary. In an out of court settlement, he agreed to remove or revise certain claims. Speaking on behalf of WWF Germany, Marco Vollmar indicated ""[Huismann] draws a distorted picture of false statements, defamations and exaggerations, but we will accept that as expressions of opinion."" (Translated from the original German: ""ein Zerrbild aus falschen Aussagen, Diffamierungen und Übertreibungen, aber das werden wir als Meinungsäußerungen hinnehmen."")[53] In 2014, German investigative journalist Wilfried Huismann published a revised edition of his 2012 book, originally called The Silence of the Pandas. The original edition had become a bestseller in Germany, but was banned from Britain until 2014, when it was released under the title of PandaLeaks - The Dark Side of the WWF, after a series of injunctions and court orders.[54] The book criticizes WWF for its involvement with corporations that are responsible for large-scale destruction of the environment, such as Coca-Cola, and gives details into the existence of the secret 1001 Club, whose members, Huismann claims, continue to have an unhealthy influence on WWF's policy making.[54] WWF has denied the allegations made against it.[55] Corporate partnerships[edit] WWF has been accused by the campaigner Corporate Watch of being too close to business to campaign objectively.[10][11] WWF claims partnering with corporations such as Coca-Cola, Lafarge, Carlos Slim's and IKEA will reduce their effect on the environment.[56] WWF received €56 million (US$80 million) from corporations in 2010 (an 8% increase in support from corporations compared to 2009), accounting for 11% of total revenue for the year.[8] For their 2019 fiscal year, WWF reported 4% of their total operating revenue coming from corporations.[57] Human rights abuses by paramilitaries[edit] In 2017, a report by Survival International claimed that WWF-funded paramilitaries are not only committing abuses against the indigenous Baka and Bayaka in the Congo Basin, who ""face harassment and beatings, torture and death"", but are also corrupt and aid in the destruction of conserved areas. The report accused WWF and its guards of partnering with several logging companies who carried out deforestation, while the rangers ignored wildlife trafficking networks.[58] In 2019, an investigation by BuzzFeed News alleged that paramilitary groups funded by the organisation are engaged in serious human rights abuses against villagers, and the organisation has covered up the incidents and acted to protect the perpetrators from law enforcement. These armed groups were claimed to torture, sexually assault, and execute villagers based on false accusations. In one instance found by BuzzFeed News investigators, an 11-year-old boy was allegedly tortured by WWF-funded rangers in front of his parents;[59] WWF ignored all complaints against the rangers. In another incident, a ranger attempted to rape a Tharu woman and, when she resisted, attacked her with bamboo stick until she lost consciousness. While the ranger was arrested, the woman was pressured not to press charges, resulting in the ranger going free. In 2010, WWF-sponsored rangers reportedly killed a 12-year-old girl who was collecting tree bark in Bardiya National Park. Park and WWF officials allegedly obstructed investigations in these cases, by ""falsifying and destroying evidence, falsely claiming the victims were poachers, and pressuring the families of the victims to withdraw criminal complaints"".[59][60] In July 2019, Buzzfeed reported that a leaked report by the WWF accused guards of beating and raping women including pregnant women while torturing men by tying their penises with fishing lines. The investigations were cut short after paramilitary groups threatened investigators with death. The investigators accused WWF of covering up the crimes. Releasing an official statement, the WWF claimed that the report was not made public to ensure the safety of the victims and that the guards were suspended and are awaiting prosecution. However Buzzfeed accused the WWF of attempting to withhold the report to the US congressional committee investigating the human rights violations by providing highly redacted versions instead.[61][62] In the Central African Republic, WWF officials were reportedly involved in an arms deal, where the organization paid for 15 Kalashnikov assault rifles and ammunition; but part of the money went unaccounted for and they were apparently defrauded by the CAR army representatives selling the weapons.[59] The Kathmandu Post, which cooperated with BuzzFeed News on the investigations in Nepal, claimed there was intense lobbying and political pressure to release WWF-funded rangers arrested for murder. They interviewed activists who claimed they were promised donations for pressuring victims of abuse to drop charges against the rangers. When the local Tharu community protested, WWF officials carried out a counter-protest in favour of the accused and used park elephants to block Prithvi Highway.[63] An investigation by Rainforest Foundation UK found evidence of widespread physical and sexual assault by ‘eco-guards’ employed by the Salonga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo funded by WWF. These include two cases of gang rape, two extrajudicial killings, and multiple accounts of torture and other forms of mistreatment committed by park guards.[64] In reply to the investigations, WWF stated that it takes any allegations seriously and would be launching an independent review into the cases raised. The organisation stated it has stringent policies designed to ensure it and its partners are safeguarding the rights and well-being of indigenous peoples and local communities, and should the review uncover any breaches, it is committed to taking swift action.[65] Initialism dispute[edit] See also: WWE § Legal disputes and controversies In 2000, the World Wide Fund for Nature sued the World Wrestling Federation (now named WWE) for unfair trade practices. Both parties had shared the initials ""WWF"" since 1979. The conservation organization claimed that the professional wrestling company had violated a 1994 agreement regarding international use of the WWF initials.[66][67] On 10 August 2001, a UK court ruled in favour of the World Wide Fund for Nature. The World Wrestling Federation filed an appeal in October 2001. However, on 10 May 2002, the World Wrestling Federation changed its Web address from WWF.com to WWE.com, and replaced every ""WWF"" reference on the existing site with ""WWE"", as a prelude to changing the company's name to ""World Wrestling Entertainment."" Its stock ticker also switched from WWF to WWE. The wrestling organization's abandonment of ""WWF"" initialism did not end the two organizations' legal conflict. Later in 2002, the World Wide Fund for Nature petitioned the court for $360 million in damages, but was not successful. A subsequent request to overturn by the World Wide Fund for Nature was dismissed by the British Court of Appeal on 28 June 2007. In 2003, World Wrestling Entertainment won a limited decision which permitted them to continue marketing certain pre-existing products with the abandoned WWF logo. However, WWE was mandated to issue newly branded merchandise such as apparel, action figures, video games, and DVDs with the ""WWE"" initials. Additionally, the court order required the company to remove both auditory and visual references to ""WWF"" in its library of video footage outside the United Kingdom. Starting with the 1,000th episode of Raw in July 2012, the WWF ""scratch"" logo is no longer censored in archival footage. In addition, the WWF initials are no longer censored when spoken or when written in plain text in archival footage. In exchange, WWE is no longer permitted to use WWF initials or logo in any new, original footage, packaging, or advertising, with any old-school logos for retro-themed programming now using a modification of the original WWF logo without the F. Mekong River dolphins report[edit] In June 2009, Touch Seang Tana, chairman of Cambodia's Commission for Conservation and Development of the Mekong River Dolphins Eco-tourism Zone, argued that the WWF had misrepresented the danger of extinction of the Mekong dolphin to boost fundraising.[68] The report stated that the deaths were caused by a bacterial disease that became fatal due to environmental contaminants suppressing the dolphins' immune systems.[69] He called the report unscientific and harmful to the Cambodian government and threatened WWF's Cambodian branch with suspension unless they met with him to discuss his claims.[70] Touch Seang Tana later said he would not press charges of supplying false information and would not make any attempt to prevent WWF from continuing its work in Cambodia, but advised WWF to adequately explain its findings and check with the commission before publishing another report. Criticism of the validity of reports critical of government action or inaction, where 'approval' has not been sought before publication, is common in Cambodia.[71] In January 2012, Touch Seang Tana signed the ""Kratie Declaration on the Conservation of the Mekong River Irrawaddy Dolphin"" along with WWF and the Cambodian Fisheries Administration, an agreement binding the parties to work together on a ""roadmap"" addressing dolphin conservation in the Mekong River.[72] Accountability[edit] The Charity Navigator gave the WWF a 3-star overall rating, a 2-star financial rating and a 4-star accountability and transparency rating for the 2018 fiscal year.[73] Manipulation of CO2 emissions[edit] In 2009, in a scorecard report that they authored on carbon emissions in G8 countries, the WWF portrayed the greenhouse gas emissions of countries who use low-carbon nuclear power in their mix as a higher amount of emissions than realistically calculated. For example, for France, the WWF displayed a false value of 362 gCO2eq/kWh which is over 400% larger than the actual emissions in France. WWF explained the manipulation as follows:[74][75] WWF does not consider nuclear power to be a viable policy option. The indicators “emissions per capita”, “emissions per GdP” and “Co2 per kWh electricity” for all countries have therefore been adjusted as if the generation of electricity from nuclear power had produced 350 gCo2/kWh (emission factor for natural gas). Without the adjustment, the original indicators for France would have been much lower, e.g. 86 gCo2/kWh. The scorecard for Sweden was also ""adjusted"" in similar way, where the WWF replaced the actual emissions of 47 gCO2eq/kWh with 212 gCO2eq/kWh.[75] Regional organisations[edit] WWF-Australia[edit] The Australian arm of WWF was established on 29 June 1978 in an old factory in Sydney, with three staff and a budget of around A$80,000 for the first year, consisting of a A$50,000 grant from the Commonwealth Government and a further A$20,500 in corporate donations. As of 2020[update], WWF-Australia is the country's biggest conservation organisation, which operates projects throughout Australia as well as the wider Oceania region.[76] Between 2015 and 2019 WWF-Australia reported an average revenue of $28.74 Million per year. In 2020, WWF-Australia reported a total revenue of over $80 Million driven by the global & local response to the Australian bushfires.[77] In 1990, WWF-Australia established the national Threatened Species Network (TSN) with the federal government, which remained operational until 2009. In 1999 it participated in the creation of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, at that time the most encompassing biodiversity conservation laws in the world. In 2003/4 the organisation played a part in getting the government to raise the level of protection for the Great Barrier Reef and the Ningaloo Reef, and since then has participated in or managed many conservation programs, such as the reintroduction of black-flanked rock-wallabies to Kalbarri National Park in Western Australia.[76] See also[edit] Environment portal Ecology portal Earth sciences portal Centres of Plant Diversity Conservation movement Environmental Dispute Resolution Fund Environmental movement Eugene Green Energy Standard, founded by the WWF.

Foster a sense of community among environmentalists at Yale University. Provide opportunities for students of all backgrounds to engage with environmental issues.ABOUTThe Yale Student Environmental Coalition (YSEC) is the umbrella organization for 8 undergraduate environmental groups. This diverse set of groups includes Project Bright: Yale Undergraduate Renewable Energy Initiative, Fossil Free Yale, Bee Space, GREEN at Yale, Environmental Education Collaborative, Students for Carbon Dividends, Yale Outdoors, and Yale Animal Welfare Alliance. ​ YSEC strives to (1) promote an awareness of the environment and climate justice, (2) educate and engage the Yale community through debates and advocacy, (3) advocate for ambitious university policy on sustainability, and (4) foster an energetic environmental community on campus. Key goals for the 2020-21 school year include working alongside the New Haven Climate Movement, expanding clean energy on campus, incubating new environmental initiatives, sending a delegation to the UN Conference of the Parties, launching an environmental humanities publication, and engaging in intersectional activism. ​ Since 1986, YSEC and its constituent groups have worked to build a body of lasting sustainability initiatives. It was a YSEC report authored at the turn of the 20th century, the Yale Green Plan, which led to the creation of the Yale Office of Sustainability. The President of Yale University, Peter Salovey, has credited the work of the Yale Student Environmental Coalition as being “very influential in helping to establish the kinds of sustainability policies and organized effort around sustainability that we see on campus today.” ​ YSEC operates with the generous support of the Andrew Kroon Memorial Fund and maintains an office in Welch Hall on Old Campus. As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, YSEC partners and connects with campus organizations, other colleges and universities, local non-profits, and major international initiatives in order to carry out its mission at Yale, within New Haven, and around the world. ​ Disclaimer: “Yale” and “Yale University” are registered trademarks of Yale University.

Founded in 1701 as the Collegiate School, it is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine Colonial Colleges chartered before the American Revolution. The Collegiate School was renamed Yale College in 1718 to honor the school's largest private benefactor for the first century of its existence, Elihu Yale.[7][8] Yale University is referred to as a member of the Big Three (colleges), is consistently ranked as one of the top universities and is considered one of the most prestigious in the nation and in the world.[9][10][11][12] Chartered by Connecticut Colony, the Collegiate School was established in 1701 by clergy to educate Congregational ministers before moving to New Haven in 1716. Originally restricted to theology and sacred languages, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution. In the 19th century, the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first PhD in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887. Yale's faculty and student populations grew after 1890 with rapid expansion of the physical campus and scientific research. Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools. While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the university owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, a campus in West Haven, Connecticut, and forests and nature preserves throughout New England. As of June 2020, the university's endowment was valued at $31.1 billion, the second largest of any educational institution.[1] The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.[13][14] Students compete in intercollegiate sports as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I – Ivy League. As of October 2020, 65 Nobel laureates, five Fields Medalists, four Abel Prize laureates, and three Turing award winners have been affiliated with Yale University. In addition, Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five U.S. Presidents, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, 31 living billionaires,[15] and many heads of state. Hundreds of members of Congress and many U.S. diplomats, 78 MacArthur Fellows, 252 Rhodes Scholars, 123 Marshall Scholars, and nine Mitchell Scholars have been affiliated with the university.

(July 2021) Early history of Yale College[edit] Origins[edit] Charter creating the Collegiate School, which became Yale College, October 9, 1701 Yale traces its beginnings to ""An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School"", a would-be charter passed during a meeting in New Haven by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut on October 9, 1701. The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. Soon after, a group of ten Congregational ministers, Samuel Andrew, Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather (nephew of Increase Mather), Rev. James Noyes II (son of James Noyes), James Pierpont, Abraham Pierson, Noadiah Russell, Joseph Webb, and Timothy Woodbridge, all alumni of Harvard, met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell, located in Branford, Connecticut, to donate their books to form the school's library.[16] The group, led by James Pierpont, is now known as ""The Founders"".[17] A Front View of Yale-College and the College Chapel, printed by Daniel Bowen in 1786 From its origin it is known as the ""Collegiate School"", the institution opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson, who is today considered the first president of Yale. Pierson lived in Killingworth (now Clinton). The school moved to Saybrook and then Wethersfield. In 1716, it moved to New Haven, Connecticut. Meanwhile, there was a rift forming at Harvard between its sixth president, Increase Mather, and the rest of the Harvard clergy, whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in Church polity. The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not.[18] Rev. Jason Haven, the minister at the First Church and Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts had been considered for the presidency on account of his orthodox theology and for ""Neatness dignity and purity of Style [which] surpass those of all that have been mentioned,"" but was passed over due to his ""very Valetudinary and infirm State of Health.""[19] Naming and development[edit] Coat of arms of the family of Elihu Yale, after whom the university was named in 1718 In 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted the successful Boston born businessman Elihu Yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Elihu ""Eli"" Yale, who had made a fortune in Madras while working for the East India Company as the first president of Fort St. George (largely through secret contracts with Madras merchants that were illegal under Company policy[20]), donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than £560, a substantial sum of money at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to ""Yale College.""[21] The Welsh name Yale is the Anglicized spelling of the Iâl, which the family estate at Plas yn Iâl, near the village of Llandegla, was called. Meanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology at the time.[22] It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the ""new divinity."" In 1722 the Rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745 and while he attempted to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy, he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.[23] Founders' connections to the slave trade[edit] One of Elihu Yale's responsibilities as president of Fort St. George was overseeing its slave trade, though he himself was never a slave trader, never owned slaves, opposed the slave trade, and imposed several restrictions on it during his tenure.[24] Critics nonetheless argue that he benefited from the trade by having it as one of his responsibilities as president, despite not owning any of the traded human beings or profiting from their sales.[25] The controversy over Yale University being named to honor the slave trader Elihu Yale dates back to at least 1994. In 2007, Yale University removed a painting which shows Elihu Yale attended to by a child slave. At the time, Yale University stated that the issues with Elihu Yale had begun at least 13 years prior. Although Elihu Yale was the president of the East India Company, a Yale University spokesperson claimed that, ""...Elihu Yale did not support slavery...""[26] A 2017 Wall Street Journal opinion article also called for renaming Yale University.[27][28] Since 2016, Yale University has acknowledged that Elihu Yale was ""...involved [in] and profited from the slave trade.""[29] The controversy over Yale's name started anew in 2020 with a Yale Daily News post, ""Yale Has to Go!""[30] After years of protest, Yale University renamed Calhoun College as Hopper College in 2017. Calhoun College was named for a South Carolina slave owner and anti-abolitionist, Vice President John C. Calhoun.[31][32][33] Yale University also acquired a slave plantation to finance its graduate program.[34] Yale University has multiple other buildings named to honor slave owners, including Bishop George Berkeley, Timothy Dwight and Ezra Stiles.[35] Curriculum[edit] Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753 First diploma awarded by Yale College, granted to Nathaniel Chauncey in 1702 Yale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and is organized into a social system of residential colleges. Yale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period—the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment—due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents Thomas Clap and Ezra Stiles. They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, ""irrelevance"" of curricula, desperate need for endowment and disagreements with the Connecticut legislature.[36][37][page needed] Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for the study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the college from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. A 1746 graduate of Yale, Stiles came to the college with experience in education, having played an integral role in the founding of Brown University, in addition to having been a minister.[38] Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the college. However, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning, Secretary to the British General in command of the occupation, intervened and the college was saved. In 1803, Fanning was granted an honorary degree LL.D. for his efforts.[39] Students[edit] As the only college in Connecticut from 1701 to 1823, Yale educated the sons of the elite.[40] Punishable offenses for students included cardplaying, tavern-going, destruction of college property, and acts of disobedience to college authorities. During this period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side.[41] The emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such organizations were debating societies: Crotonia in 1738, Linonia in 1753 and Brothers in Unity in 1768. While the societies no longer exist, commemorations to them can be found with names given to campus structures, like Brothers in Unity Courtyard in Branford College. 19th century[edit] Old Brick Row in 1807 The Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. During this period, all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track curriculum. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because it was difficult for an institution to be completely modern or completely classical.[42][43] A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a person possessed of religious values strong enough to sufficiently resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without.[44][page needed] William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms of students. Sumner bested President Noah Porter, who disliked the social sciences and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. Porter objected to Sumner's use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students.[45] Until 1887, the legal name of the university was ""The President and Fellows of Yale College, in New Haven."" In 1887, under an act passed by the Connecticut General Assembly, Yale was renamed to the present ""Yale University.""[46] Sports and debate[edit] The Revolutionary War soldier Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the archetype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who ""regretted"" that he ""had but one life to lose"" for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in the combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied this same heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel Stover at Yale (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, the alumni, and the team itself.[47] Yale's four-oared crew team posing with the 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy, won in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Along with Harvard and Princeton, Yale students rejected British concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football.[48][page needed] The Harvard–Yale football rivalry began in 1875. Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates,[49][page needed] and in 1909 (the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale and Princeton) the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There were also rallies to send off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.[50] In 1909–10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905–06, which sought to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. Presidents Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate reforms to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. While the big three had attempted to operate independently of the majority, the changes pushed did reduce injuries.[51] Expansion[edit] Starting with the addition of the Yale School of Medicine in 1810, the college expanded gradually from then on, establishing the Yale Divinity School in 1822, Yale Law School in 1822, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1847, the now-defunct Sheffield Scientific School in 1847,[52] and the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1869. In 1887, under the presidency of Timothy Dwight V, Yale College was renamed to Yale University, and the former name was subsequently applied only to the undergraduate college. The university would continue to expand greatly into the 20th and 21st century, adding the Yale School of Music in 1894, the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies in 1900, the Yale School of Public Health in 1915, the Yale School of Architecture in 1916, the Yale School of Nursing 1923, the Yale School of Drama in 1955, the Yale School of Management in 1976, and the Jackson School of Global Affairs which is planned to open in 2022.[53] The Sheffield Scientific School would also reorganize its relationship with the university to teach only undergraduate courses. Expansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. Noah Porter, a moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership.[citation needed] Historian George Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.[54][page needed] Levesque continues, saying he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. Levesque concludes, mention how he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university. 20th century[edit] Medicine[edit] Woolsey Hall c. 1905 Milton Winternitz led the Yale School of Medicine as its dean from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about ""social medicine"" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the ""Yale System"" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the Psychiatry Department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to resign.[55] Faculty[edit] Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor of the Yale campus facing northBefore World War II, most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions.[56] Almost all members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—and some members of other faculties—teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually.[57] Women[edit] In 1793, Lucinda Foote passed the entrance exams for Yale College, but was rejected by the President on the basis of her gender.[58] Women studied at Yale University as early as 1892, in graduate-level programs at the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[59] In 1966, Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female and part of the Seven Sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the Ivy League when most Ivy League institutions still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969.[60] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate;[61] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall. The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year;[62] at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall at the south end of Old Campus.[63] A decade into co-education, student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit Alexander v. Yale. In the late 1970s, a group of students and one faculty member sued Yale for its failure to curtail campus sexual harassment by especially male faculty. The case was party built from a 1977 report authored by plaintiff Ann Olivarius, now a feminist attorney known for fighting sexual harassment, ""A report to the Yale Corporation from the Yale Undergraduate Women's Caucus.""[64] This case was the first to use Title IX to argue and establish that the sexual harassment of female students can be considered illegal sex discrimination. The plaintiffs in the case were Olivarius, Ronni Alexander (now a professor at Kobe University, Japan), Margery Reifler (works in the Los Angeles film industry), Pamela Price (civil rights attorney in California), and Lisa E. Stone (works at Anti-Defamation League). They were joined by Yale classics professor John “Jack” J. Winkler, who died in 1990. The lawsuit, brought partly by Catharine MacKinnon, alleged rape, fondling, and offers of higher grades for sex by several Yale faculty, including Keith Brion, professor of flute and Director of Bands, Political Science professor Raymond Duvall (now at the University of Minnesota), English professor Michael Cooke, and coach of the field hockey team, Richard Kentwell. While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale's Grievance Board and the Yale Women's Center.[65] In March 2011 a Title IX complaint was filed against Yale by students and recent graduates, including editors of Yale's feminist magazine Broad Recognition, alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate.[66] In response, the university formed a Title IX steering committee to address complaints of sexual misconduct.[67] Afterwards, universities and colleges throughout the US also established sexual harassment grievance procedures. Class[edit] Yale, like other Ivy League schools, instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to maintain the proportion of white Protestants from notable families in the student body (see numerus clausus), and was one of the last of the Ivies to eliminate such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970.[68] 21st century[edit] In 2006, Yale and Peking University (PKU) established a Joint Undergraduate Program in Beijing, an exchange program allowing Yale students to spend a semester living and studying with PKU honor students.[69] In July 2012, the Yale University-PKU Program ended due to weak participation.[69] In 2007 outgoing Yale President Rick Levin characterized Yale's institutional priorities: ""First, among the nation's finest research universities, Yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education. Second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in Yale College, we are committed to the education of leaders.""[70] In 2009, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair picked Yale as one location – the others being Britain's Durham University and Universiti Teknologi Mara – for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation's United States Faith and Globalization Initiative.[71] As of 2009, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is the director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar, ""Debating Globalization"".[72] As of 2009, former presidential candidate and DNC chair Howard Dean teaches a residential college seminar, ""Understanding Politics and Politicians"".[73] Also in 2009, an alliance was formed among Yale, University College London, and both schools' affiliated hospital complexes to conduct research focused on the direct improvement of patient care—a growing field known as translational medicine. President Richard Levin noted that Yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world, but ""no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with UCL"".[74] In August 2013, a new partnership with the National University of Singapore led to the opening of Yale-NUS College in Singapore, a joint effort to create a new liberal arts college in Asia featuring a curriculum including both Western and Asian traditions.[75] In 2020, in the wake of protests around the world focused on racial relations and criminal justice reform, the #CancelYale tag was used on social media to demand that Elihu Yale's name be removed from Yale University. Most support for the change stemmed from politically conservative pundits, such as Mike Cernovich and Ann Coulter, satirizing perceived excesses of online cancel culture.[76] Yale was president of the East India Company, a trading company that traded slaves as well as goods, [77] and his singularly large donation[78][79] led to Yale relying on money from the slave-trade for its first scholarships and endowments.[25][80] In August 2020, the US Justice Department claimed that Yale discriminated against Asian and white candidates on the basis of their race. The university, however, denied the report.[81] In early February 2021, under the new Biden administration, the Justice Department withdrew the lawsuit. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, known for a similar lawsuit against Harvard alleging the same issue, plans to refile the lawsuit.[82] Yale alumni in politics[edit] The Boston Globe wrote that ""if there's one school that can lay claim to educating the nation's top national leaders over the past three decades, it's Yale"".[83][verification needed] Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. presidential election between 1972 and 2004.[84] Yale-educated Presidents since the end of the Vietnam War include Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, and major-party nominees during this period include Hillary Clinton (2016), John Kerry (2004), Joseph Lieberman (Vice President, 2000), and Sargent Shriver (Vice President, 1972). Other Yale alumni who have made serious bids for the Presidency during this period include Amy Klobuchar (2020), Tom Steyer (2020), Ben Carson (2016), Howard Dean (2004), Gary Hart (1984 and 1988), Paul Tsongas (1992), Pat Robertson (1988) and Jerry Brown (1976, 1980, 1992). Several explanations have been offered for Yale's representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates.[85][verification needed] Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale's focus on creating ""a laboratory for future leaders,"" an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster.[85] Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: ""We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale.""[83] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes ""an ethos of organized activity"" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News.[86] Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: ""It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school.""[87] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the ""son and grandson of alumni"", and for a ""member of a politically influential family"".[88] New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and The Atlantic Monthly correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others.[89] During the 1988 presidential election, George H. W. Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis for having ""foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique"". When challenged on the distinction between Dukakis' Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was ""so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it"" and said Yale did not share Harvard's reputation for ""liberalism and elitism"".[90] In 2004 Howard Dean stated, ""In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of '68 and the class of '71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation"".[89] Administration and organization[edit] Leadership[edit] School founding School Year founded Yale College 1701 Yale School of Medicine 1810 Yale Divinity School 1822 Yale Law School 1843 Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences 1847 Sheffield Scientific School[52] 1847 Yale School of Fine Arts 1869 Yale School of Music 1894 Yale School of the Environment 1900 Yale School of Public Health 1915 Yale School of Architecture 1916 Yale School of Nursing 1923 David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University 1955 Yale School of Management 1976 Jackson School of Global Affairs Planned for fall 2022[53] The President and Fellows of Yale College, also known as the Yale Corporation, or board of trustees, is the governing body of the university and consists of thirteen standing committees with separate responsibilities outlined in the by-laws. The corporation has 19 members: three ex officio members, ten successor trustees, and six elected alumni fellows.[91] The university has three major academic components: Yale College (the undergraduate program), the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the twelve professional schools.[92] Yale's former president Richard C. Levin was, at the time, one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million.[93] Yale's succeeding president Peter Salovey ranks 40th with a 2020 salary of $1.16 million.[94] The Yale Provost's Office and similar executive positions have launched several women into prominent university executive positions. In 1977, Provost Hanna Holborn Gray was appointed interim President of Yale and later went on to become President of the University of Chicago, being the first woman to hold either position at each respective school.[95][96] In 1994, Provost Judith Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution at the University of Pennsylvania.[97] In 2002, Provost Alison Richard became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge.[98] In 2003, the Dean of the Divinity School, Rebecca Chopp, was appointed president of Colgate University and later went on to serve as the President of the Swarthmore College in 2009, and then the first female chancellor of the University of Denver in 2014.[99] In 2004, Provost Dr. Susan Hockfield became the President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[100] In 2004, Dean of the Nursing school, Catherine Gilliss, was appointed the Dean of Duke University's School of Nursing and Vice Chancellor for Nursing Affairs.[101] In 2007, Deputy Provost H. Kim Bottomly was named President of Wellesley College.[102] Similar examples for men who've served in Yale leadership positions can also be found. In 2004, Dean of Yale College Richard H. Brodhead was appointed as the President of Duke University.[103] In 2008, Provost Andrew Hamilton was confirmed to be the Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford.[104] Staff and labor unions[edit] See also: Federation of Hospital and University Employees Yale University staff are represented by several different unions. Clerical and technical workers are represented by Local 34, and service and maintenance workers are represented by Local 35, both of the same union affiliate UNITE HERE.[105] Unlike similar institutions, Yale has consistently refused to recognize its graduate student union, Local 33 (another affiliate of UNITE HERE), citing claims that the union's elections were undemocratic and how graduate students are not employees;[106][107] the move to not recognize the union has been criticized by the American Federation of Teachers.[108] In addition, officers of the Yale University Police Department are represented by the Yale Police Benevolent Association, which affiliated in 2005 with the Connecticut Organization for Public Safety Employees.[105][109] Yale security officers joined the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America in late 2010,[110] even though the Yale administration contested the election.[111] In October 2014, after deliberation,[112] Yale security decided to form a new union, the Yale University Security Officers Association, which has since represented the campus security officers.[105][113] Yale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations, often culminating in strikes.[114][page needed] There have been at least eight strikes since 1968, and The New York Times wrote that Yale has a reputation as having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the U.S.[115] Moreover, Yale has been accused by the AFL–CIO of failing to treat workers with respect,[116] as well as not renewing contracts with professors over involvement in campus labor issues.[117] Yale has responded to strikes with claims over mediocre union participation and the benefits of their contracts.[118] Campus[edit] Yale Law School, located in the Sterling Law Building Interior of Beinecke Library Yale's central campus in downtown New Haven covers 260 acres (1.1 km2) and comprises its main, historic campus and a medical campus adjacent to the Yale–New Haven Hospital. In western New Haven, the university holds 500 acres (2.0 km2) of athletic facilities, including the Yale Golf Course.[119] In 2008, Yale purchased the 17-building, 136-acre (0.55 km2) former Bayer HealthCare complex in West Haven, Connecticut,[120] the buildings of which are now used as laboratory and research space.[121] Yale also owns seven forests in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire—the largest of which is the 7,840-acre (31.7 km2) Yale-Myers Forest in Connecticut's Quiet Corner—and nature preserves including Horse Island.[122] Yale is noted for its largely Collegiate Gothic campus[123] as well as several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: Louis Kahn's Yale Art Gallery[124] and Center for British Art, Eero Saarinen's Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph's Art & Architecture Building. Yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along Hillhouse Avenue, which was considered the most beautiful street in America by Charles Dickens when he visited the United States in the 1840s.[125] In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the Yale campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States.[126] Many of Yale's buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness, including the Yale Drama School.[127][128] Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities, such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes, like a policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid,[129] deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, 216 feet (66 m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon Statue of Nathan Hale in front of Connecticut Hall Vanderbilt Hall Other examples of the Gothic style are on the Old Campus by architects like Henry Austin, Charles C. Haight and Russell Sturgis. Several are associated with members of the Vanderbilt family, including Vanderbilt Hall,[130] Phelps Hall,[131] St. Anthony Hall (a commission for member Frederick William Vanderbilt), the Mason, Sloane and Osborn laboratories, dormitories for the Sheffield Scientific School (the engineering and sciences school at Yale until 1956) and elements of Silliman College, the largest residential college.[132] The oldest building on campus, Connecticut Hall (built in 1750), is in the Georgian style. Georgian-style buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include Timothy Dwight College, Pierson College, and Davenport College, except the latter's east, York Street façade, which was constructed in the Gothic style to coordinate with adjacent structures. The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books and manuscripts. The library includes a six-story above-ground tower of book stacks, filled with 180,000 volumes, that is surrounded by large translucent Vermont marble panels and a steel and granite truss. The panels act as windows and subdue direct sunlight while also diffusing the light in warm hues throughout the interior.[133] Near the library is a sunken courtyard, with sculptures by Isamu Noguchi that are said to represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube).[134] The library is located near the center of the university in Hewitt Quadrangle, which is now more commonly referred to as ""Beinecke Plaza."" Alumnus Eero Saarinen, Finnish-American architect of such notable structures as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Washington Dulles International Airport main terminal, Bell Labs Holmdel Complex and the CBS Building in Manhattan, designed Ingalls Rink, dedicated in 1959,[135] as well as the residential colleges Ezra Stiles and Morse.[136] These latter were modeled after the medieval Italian hill town of San Gimignano – a prototype chosen for the town's pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone towers.[137] These tower forms at Yale act in counterpoint to the college's many Gothic spires and Georgian cupolas.[138] Yale's Old Campus at dusk, April 2013 Notable nonresidential campus buildings[edit] Harkness Tower Notable nonresidential campus buildings and landmarks include Battell Chapel, Beinecke Rare Book Library, Harkness Tower, Ingalls Rink, Kline Biology Tower, Osborne Memorial Laboratories, Payne Whitney Gymnasium, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Sterling Hall of Medicine, Sterling Law Buildings, Sterling Memorial Library, Woolsey Hall, Yale Center for British Art, Yale University Art Gallery, Yale Art & Architecture Building, and the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art in London. Yale's secret society buildings (some of which are called ""tombs"") were built both to be private yet unmistakable. A diversity of architectural styles is represented: Berzelius, Donn Barber in an austere cube with classical detailing (erected in 1908 or 1910); Book and Snake, Louis R. Metcalfe in a Greek Ionic style (erected in 1901); Elihu, architect unknown but built in a Colonial style (constructed on an early 17th-century foundation although the building is from the 18th century); Mace and Chain, in a late colonial, early Victorian style (built in 1823). (Interior moulding is said to have belonged to Benedict Arnold);Manuscript Society, King Lui-Wu with Dan Kniley responsible for landscaping and Josef Albers for the brickwork intaglio mural. Building constructed in a mid-century modern style; Scroll and Key, Richard Morris Hunt in a Moorish- or Islamic-inspired Beaux-Arts style (erected 1869–70); Skull and Bones, possibly Alexander Jackson Davis or Henry Austin in an Egypto-Doric style utilizing Brownstone (in 1856 the first wing was completed, in 1903 the second wing, 1911 the Neo-Gothic towers in rear garden were completed); St. Elmo, (former tomb) Kenneth M. Murchison, 1912, designs inspired by Elizabethan manor. Current location, brick colonial; and Wolf's Head, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, erected 1923–1924, Collegiate Gothic. Sustainability[edit] Yale's Office of Sustainability develops and implements sustainability practices at Yale.[139] Yale is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10% below 1990 levels by the year 2020. As part of this commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by residential colleges.[140] Eleven campus buildings are candidates for LEED design and certification.[141] Yale Sustainable Food Project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all residential college dining halls.[142] Yale was listed as a Campus Sustainability Leader on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2008, and received a ""B+"" grade overall.[143] Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven Marsh Botanical Garden Yale Sustainable Food Program Farm Relationship with New Haven[edit] Yale is the largest taxpayer and employer in the City of New Haven,[144] and has often buoyed the city's economy and communities. Yale, however has consistently opposed paying a tax on its academic property.[145] Yale's Art Galleries, along with many other university resources, are free and openly accessible. Yale also funds the New Haven Promise program, paying full tuition for eligible students from New Haven public schools.[146] Town–gown relations[edit] Yale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.[147] Campus safety[edit] Several campus safety strategies have been pioneered at Yale. The first campus police force was founded at Yale in 1894, when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus.[148][149] Later hired by the university, the officers were originally brought in to quell unrest between students and city residents and curb destructive student behavior.[150][151] In addition to the Yale Police Department, a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a safety escort, and 24-hour shuttle service. In the 1970s and 1980s, poverty and violent crime rose in New Haven, dampening Yale's student and faculty recruiting efforts.[152] Between 1990 and 2006, New Haven's crime rate fell by half, helped by a community policing strategy by the New Haven Police and Yale's campus became the safest among the Ivy League and other peer schools.[153] In 2004, the national non-profit watchdog group Security on Campus filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, accusing Yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults.[154][155] In April 2021, Yale announced that it will require students to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of being on campus during the fall 2021 term.[156] Academics[edit] Admissions[edit] Admissions statistics2020 enteringclass[157]Change vs.2015[158]Admit rate6.5% ( −0.2)Yield rate54.9% ( −12)Test scores middle 50%SAT EBRW720–780SAT Math740–800ACT Composite33–35High school GPATop 10%†94% ( −3)†Among students whose school ranked Undergraduate admission to Yale College is considered ""most selective"" by U.S. News.[159][160] In 2017, Yale accepted 2,285 students to the Class of 2021 out of 32,914 applicants, for an acceptance rate of 6.9%.[161] 98% of students graduate within six years.[162] Through its program of need-based financial aid, Yale commits to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants. Most financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not need to be paid back to the university, and the average need-based aid grant for the Class of 2017 was $46,395.[163] 15% of Yale College students are expected to have no parental contribution, and about 50% receive some form of financial aid.[162][164][165] About 16% of the Class of 2013 had some form of student loan debt at graduation, with an average debt of $13,000 among borrowers.[162] Half of all Yale undergraduates are women, more than 39% are ethnic minority U.S. citizens (19% are underrepresented minorities), and 10.5% are international students.[163] 55% attended public schools and 45% attended private, religious, or international schools, and 97% of students were in the top 10% of their high school class.[162] Every year, Yale College also admits a small group of non-traditional students through the Eli Whitney Students Program. Collections[edit] Yale University's Sterling Memorial Library, as seen from Maya Lin's sculpture, Women's Table. The sculpture records the number of women enrolled at Yale over its history; female undergraduates were not admitted until 1969. Yale University Library, which holds over 15 million volumes, is the third-largest university collection in the United States.[13][166] The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject libraries. Rare books are found in several Yale collections. The Beinecke Rare Book Library has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The Lewis Walpole Library contains the largest collection of 18th‑century British literary works. The Elizabethan Club, technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale. The Night Café, Vincent van Gogh, 1888, Yale Art Gallery Yale's museum collections are also of international stature. The Yale University Art Gallery, the country's first university-affiliated art museum, contains more than 200,000 works, including Old Masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartwout and Kahn buildings. The latter, Louis Kahn's first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The Yale Center for British Art, the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of Paul Mellon and is housed in another Kahn-designed building. The Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments, affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of Yale's collections because its hours of opening are restricted. The museums once housed the artifacts brought to the United States from Peru by Yale history professor Hiram Bingham in his Yale-financed expedition to Machu Picchu in 1912 – when the removal of such artifacts was legal. The artifacts were restored to Peru in 2012.[167] Academic rankings National ARWU[168] 9 Forbes[169] 3 THE/WSJ[170] 3 U.S. News & World Report[171] 4 Washington Monthly[172] 4 Global ARWU[173] 11 QS[174] 14 THE[175] 8 U.S. News & World Report[176] 11 USNWR graduate school rankings[177] Business 9 Engineering 39 Law 1 Medicine: Primary Care 49 Medicine: Research 15 Nursing: Doctorate 17 Nursing: Master's 14 Rankings[edit] USNWR departmental rankings[177] Biological Sciences 6 Chemistry 9 Clinical Psychology 18 Computer Science 20 Earth Sciences 13 Economics 1 English 8 Fine Arts 2 History 1 Mathematics 9 Nursing–Midwifery 2 Physician Assistant 26 Physics 12 Political Science 4 Psychology 3 Public Health 15 Sociology 22 Statistics 31 The U.S. News & World Report ranked Yale 3rd among U.S. national universities for 2016,[159] as it had for each of the previous sixteen years.

(March 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Yale is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) and is classified among ""R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity"".[184] According to the National Science Foundation, Yale spent $990 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 15th in the nation.[185] Yale's faculty include 61 members of the National Academy of Sciences,[186] 7 members of the National Academy of Engineering[187] and 49 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The college is, after normalization for institution size, the tenth-largest baccalaureate source of doctoral degree recipients in the United States, and the largest such source within the Ivy League.[188] Yale's English and Comparative Literature departments were part of the New Criticism movement. Of the New Critics, Robert Penn Warren, W.K. Wimsatt, and Cleanth Brooks were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American deconstruction. Jacques Derrida, the father of deconstruction, taught at the Department of Comparative Literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called ""Yale School"". These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C. Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, David Montgomery, a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th century. The Journal of Music Theory was founded there in 1957; Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and scholars. In addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 Postdocs from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the Yale Postdoctoral Association. Campus life[edit] Yale is a research university, with the majority of its students in the graduate and professional schools. Undergraduates, or Yale College students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010–2011 freshman class, 10% are non‑U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.[189] The median family income of Yale students is $192,600, with 57% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 16% from the bottom 60%.[190] Residential colleges[edit] Main article: Residential colleges of Yale University Yale's residential college system was established in 1933 by Edward S. Harkness, who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as ""Master's Teas,"" but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college. All undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.[191] While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the Old Campus, the university's oldest precinct. While Harkness' original colleges were Georgian Revival or Collegiate Gothic in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history. In 2017, the university opened two new colleges near Science Hill.[192] Jonathan Edwards College courtyard Branford College courtyard Saybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard Hopper College courtyard Berkeley College buildings Trumbull College courtyard Davenport College courtyard Pierson College courtyard Silliman College courtyard Timothy Dwight College courtyard Morse College courtyard Ezra Stiles College courtyard Benjamin Franklin College courtyard Pauli Murray College courtyard Calhoun College[edit] Since the 1960s, John C. Calhoun's white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership[193][194][195][196] had prompted calls to rename the college or remove its tributes to Calhoun. The racially motivated church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, led to renewed calls in the summer of 2015 for Calhoun College, one of 12 residential colleges, to be renamed. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change.[194] They argued in the petition that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an ""extraordinary American statesman""—he was ""one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy"" in the history of the United States.[194][195] In August 2015 Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed.[196] He described Calhoun as ""a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina"".[196] He acknowledged that Calhoun also ""believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude. Not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests.""[193] Student activism about this issue increased in the fall of 2015, and included further protests sparked by controversy surrounding an administrator's comments on the potential positive and negative implications of students who wear Halloween costumes that are culturally sensitive.[197] Campus-wide discussions expanded to include critical discussion of the experiences of women of color on campus, and the realities of racism in undergraduate life.[198] The protests were sensationalized by the media and led to the labelling of some students as being members of Generation Snowflake.[199] In April 2016 Salovey announced that ""despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests,"" Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college[200] explaining that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun's ""shadow"" so they will be ""better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future"". He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would ""obscure"" his ""legacy of slavery rather than addressing it"".[200] ""Yale is part of that history"" and ""We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it."" One change that will be issued is the title of ""master"" for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to ""head of college"" due to its connotation of slavery.[201] Despite this apparently conclusive reasoning, Salovey announced that Calhoun College would be renamed for groundbreaking computer scientist Grace Murray Hopper in February 2017.[202] This renaming decision received a range of responses from Yale students and alumni.[203][204][205] Student organizations[edit] In 2014, Yale had 385 registered student organizations, plus an additional one hundred groups in the process of registration.[206] The university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. Established in 1872, The Yale Record is the world's oldest humor magazine. Newspapers include the Yale Daily News, which was first published in 1878, and the weekly Yale Herald, which was first published in 1986. The Yale Journal of Medicine & Law is a biannual magazine that explores the intersection of law and medicine. Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in New Haven. The Yale College Council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. The Yale Dramatic Association and Bulldog Productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. In addition, the Yale Drama Coalition[207] serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio[208] is the campus's radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM and FM frequencies, they now have an Internet-only stream. The Yale College Council (YCC) serves as the campus's undergraduate student government. All registered student organizations are regulated and funded by a subsidiary organization of the YCC, known as the Undergraduate Organizations Funding Committee (UOFC).[209] The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) serves as Yale's graduate and professional student government. The Yale Political Union is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry and George Pataki. The Yale International Relations Association (YIRA) functions as the umbrella organization for the top-ranked Model UN team. YIRA also has a Europe-based offshoot, Yale Model Government Europe, other Model UN conferences such as YMUN Korea or YMUN Taiwan, and educational programs such as the Yale Review of International Relations (YRIS), YMUN Institute, or Hemispheres. The campus includes several fraternities and sororities. The campus features at least 18 a cappella groups, the most famous of which is The Whiffenpoofs, which from its founding in 1909 until 2018 was made up solely of senior men. Yale's secret societies include Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, Wolf's Head, Book and Snake, Elihu, Berzelius, St. Elmo, Manuscript, Shabtai, Myth and Sword, Mace and Chain and Sage and Chalice. The two oldest existing honor societies are the Aurelian (1910) and the Torch Honor Society (1916).[210] The Elizabethan Club, a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. Membership is by invitation. Members and their guests may enter the ""Lizzie's"" premises for conversation and tea. The club owns first editions of a Shakespeare Folio, several Shakespeare Quartos, and a first edition of Milton's Paradise Lost, among other important literary texts. Traditions[edit] See also: Bladderball Yale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their ""bright college years,"" though in recent history the pipes have been replaced with ""bubble pipes"".[211][212] (""Bright College Years,"" the university's alma mater, was penned in 1881 by Henry Durand, Class of 1881, to the tune of Die Wacht am Rhein.) Yale's student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus; however, actual students rarely do so.[213] In the second half of the 20th century Bladderball, a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009, 2011, and 2014.[214][215][216] Athletic[edit] Main article: Yale Bulldogs The Yale Bowl, the college football stadium located near Yale University Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference, the Eastern College Athletic Conference, the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association. Yale athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the NCAA Division I level. Like other members of the Ivy League, Yale does not offer athletic scholarships. Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Yale Bowl (the nation's first natural ""bowl"" stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl), located at The Walter Camp Field athletic complex, and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world.[217] In May 2018, the men's lacrosse team defeated the Duke Blue Devils to claim their first ever NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship,[218] and are the first Ivy League school to win the title since the Princeton Tigers in 2001.[219] In 2016, the men's basketball team won the Ivy League Championship title for the first time in 54 years, earning a spot in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In the first round of the tournament, the Bulldogs beat the Baylor Bears 79–75 in the school's first-ever tournament win.[220] The Walter Camp Gate at the Yale Athletic Complex October 21, 2000, marked the dedication of Yale's fourth new boathouse in 157 years of collegiate rowing. The Gilder Boathouse is named to honor former Olympic rower Virginia Gilder '79 and her father Richard Gilder '54, who gave $4 million towards the $7.5 million project. Yale also maintains the Gales Ferry site where the heavyweight men's team trains for the Yale-Harvard Boat Race. Yale crew is the oldest collegiate athletic team in America, and won Olympic Games Gold Medal for men's eights in 1924 and 1956. The Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate sailing club in the world. In 1896, Yale and Johns Hopkins played the first known ice hockey game in the United States. Since 2006, the school's ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game.[221] Yale students claim to have invented Frisbee, by tossing empty Frisbie Pie Company tins.[222][223] Yale athletics are supported by the Yale Precision Marching Band. ""Precision"" is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching.[224] The band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter. Yale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about ten different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup. Song[edit] Notable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement, convocation, alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, ""Bright College Years"". Despite its popularity, ""Boola Boola"" is not the official fight song, albeit being the origin of the university's unofficial motto. The official Yale fight song, ""Bulldog"" was written by Cole Porter during his undergraduate days and is sung after touchdowns during a football game.[225] Additionally, two other songs, ""Down the Field"" by C.W. O'Conner, and ""Bingo Eli Yale"", also by Cole Porter, are still sung at football games. According to College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology published in 1998, ""Down the Field"" ranks as the fourth-greatest fight song of all time.[226] Mascot[edit] The school mascot is ""Handsome Dan,"" the Yale bulldog, and the Yale fight song contains the refrain, ""Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow"". The school color, since 1894, is Yale Blue.[227] Yale's Handsome Dan is believed to be the first college mascot in America, having been established in 1889.[228] Notable people[edit] Benefactors[edit] Yale has had many financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. Among those who have made large donations commemorated at the university are: Elihu Yale; Jeremiah Dummer; the Harkness family (Edward, Anna, and William); the Beinecke family (Edwin, Frederick, and Walter); John William Sterling; Payne Whitney; Joseph Earl Sheffield, Paul Mellon, Charles B. G. Murphy, Joseph Tsai, and William K. Lanman. The Yale Class of 1954, led by Richard Gilder, donated $70 million in commemoration of their 50th reunion.[229] Charles B. Johnson, a 1954 graduate of Yale College, pledged a $250 million gift in 2013 to support the construction of two new residential colleges.[230] The colleges have been named respectively in honor of Pauli Murray and Benjamin Franklin. A $100 million contribution[231] by Stephen Adams enabled the Yale School of Music to become tuition-free and the Adams Center for Musical Arts to be built.

In fiction and popular culture[edit] Further information: List of Yale University people and Yale University in popular culture Yale University, as one of the oldest universities in the United States, is a cultural referent as an institution that produces some of the most elite members of society[362] and its grounds, alumni, and students have been prominently portrayed in fiction and U.S. popular culture. For example, Owen Johnson's novel Stover at Yale follows the college career of Dink Stover,[363] and Frank Merriwell, the model for all later juvenile sports fiction, plays football, baseball, crew, and track at Yale while solving mysteries and righting wrongs.[364][365] Yale University also is mentioned in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby. The narrator, Nick Carraway, wrote a series of editorials for the Yale News, and Tom Buchanan was ""one of the most powerful ends that ever played football"" for Yale. In the popular TV show The Simpsons, Mr. Burns is a Yale alumnus. References[edit] ^ a b ""Yale University Financial Report 2019-2020"" (PDF). Yale University. 2020.

So-called “public Ivies” such as University of Michigan and Berkeley were not considered elite or even prestigious in the minds of evaluators (in contrast, these “state schools” were frequently described pejoratively as “safety schools” that were “just okay”). Even Ivy League designation was insufficient for inclusion in the super-elite. For undergraduate institutions, “top-tier” typically included only Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Stanford, and potentially Wharton (University of Pennsylvania’s Business School). By contrast, Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth, and University of Pennsylvania (general studies) were frequently described as “second tier” schools that were filled primarily with candidates who “didn’t get in” to a super-elite school. Definitions of “top-tier” were even narrower for professional schools, primarily referring to Yale, Harvard, Stanford, and to a lesser extent Columbia law schools... line feed character in |quote= at position 747 (help) ^ ""Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education College Rankings 2021"".

Founded in 1701 as the Collegiate School, it is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine Colonial Colleges chartered before the American Revolution. The Collegiate School was renamed Yale College in 1718 to honor the school's largest private benefactor for the first century of its existence, Elihu Yale.[7][8] Yale University is referred to as a member of the Big Three (colleges), is consistently ranked as one of the top universities and is considered one of the most prestigious in the nation and in the world.[9][10][11][12] Chartered by Connecticut Colony, the Collegiate School was established in 1701 by clergy to educate Congregational ministers before moving to New Haven in 1716. Originally restricted to theology and sacred languages, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution. In the 19th century, the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first PhD in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887. Yale's faculty and student populations grew after 1890 with rapid expansion of the physical campus and scientific research. Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools. While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the university owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, a campus in West Haven, Connecticut, and forests and nature preserves throughout New England. As of June 2020, the university's endowment was valued at $31.1 billion, the second largest of any educational institution.[1] The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.[13][14] Students compete in intercollegiate sports as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I – Ivy League. As of October 2020, 65 Nobel laureates, five Fields Medalists, four Abel Prize laureates, and three Turing award winners have been affiliated with Yale University. In addition, Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five U.S. Presidents, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, 31 living billionaires,[15] and many heads of state. Hundreds of members of Congress and many U.S. diplomats, 78 MacArthur Fellows, 252 Rhodes Scholars, 123 Marshall Scholars, and nine Mitchell Scholars have been affiliated with the university.

(July 2021) Early history of Yale College[edit] Origins[edit] Charter creating the Collegiate School, which became Yale College, October 9, 1701 Yale traces its beginnings to ""An Act for Liberty to Erect a Collegiate School"", a would-be charter passed during a meeting in New Haven by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut on October 9, 1701. The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. Soon after, a group of ten Congregational ministers, Samuel Andrew, Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather (nephew of Increase Mather), Rev. James Noyes II (son of James Noyes), James Pierpont, Abraham Pierson, Noadiah Russell, Joseph Webb, and Timothy Woodbridge, all alumni of Harvard, met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell, located in Branford, Connecticut, to donate their books to form the school's library.[16] The group, led by James Pierpont, is now known as ""The Founders"".[17] A Front View of Yale-College and the College Chapel, printed by Daniel Bowen in 1786 From its origin it is known as the ""Collegiate School"", the institution opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson, who is today considered the first president of Yale. Pierson lived in Killingworth (now Clinton). The school moved to Saybrook and then Wethersfield. In 1716, it moved to New Haven, Connecticut. Meanwhile, there was a rift forming at Harvard between its sixth president, Increase Mather, and the rest of the Harvard clergy, whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in Church polity. The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not.[18] Rev. Jason Haven, the minister at the First Church and Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts had been considered for the presidency on account of his orthodox theology and for ""Neatness dignity and purity of Style [which] surpass those of all that have been mentioned,"" but was passed over due to his ""very Valetudinary and infirm State of Health.""[19] Naming and development[edit] Coat of arms of the family of Elihu Yale, after whom the university was named in 1718 In 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted the successful Boston born businessman Elihu Yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Elihu ""Eli"" Yale, who had made a fortune in Madras while working for the East India Company as the first president of Fort St. George (largely through secret contracts with Madras merchants that were illegal under Company policy[20]), donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than £560, a substantial sum of money at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to ""Yale College.""[21] The Welsh name Yale is the Anglicized spelling of the Iâl, which the family estate at Plas yn Iâl, near the village of Llandegla, was called. Meanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology at the time.[22] It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the ""new divinity."" In 1722 the Rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745 and while he attempted to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy, he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.[23] Founders' connections to the slave trade[edit] One of Elihu Yale's responsibilities as president of Fort St. George was overseeing its slave trade, though he himself was never a slave trader, never owned slaves, opposed the slave trade, and imposed several restrictions on it during his tenure.[24] Critics nonetheless argue that he benefited from the trade by having it as one of his responsibilities as president, despite not owning any of the traded human beings or profiting from their sales.[25] The controversy over Yale University being named to honor the slave trader Elihu Yale dates back to at least 1994. In 2007, Yale University removed a painting which shows Elihu Yale attended to by a child slave. At the time, Yale University stated that the issues with Elihu Yale had begun at least 13 years prior. Although Elihu Yale was the president of the East India Company, a Yale University spokesperson claimed that, ""...Elihu Yale did not support slavery...""[26] A 2017 Wall Street Journal opinion article also called for renaming Yale University.[27][28] Since 2016, Yale University has acknowledged that Elihu Yale was ""...involved [in] and profited from the slave trade.""[29] The controversy over Yale's name started anew in 2020 with a Yale Daily News post, ""Yale Has to Go!""[30] After years of protest, Yale University renamed Calhoun College as Hopper College in 2017. Calhoun College was named for a South Carolina slave owner and anti-abolitionist, Vice President John C. Calhoun.[31][32][33] Yale University also acquired a slave plantation to finance its graduate program.[34] Yale University has multiple other buildings named to honor slave owners, including Bishop George Berkeley, Timothy Dwight and Ezra Stiles.[35] Curriculum[edit] Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753 First diploma awarded by Yale College, granted to Nathaniel Chauncey in 1702 Yale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and is organized into a social system of residential colleges. Yale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period—the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment—due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents Thomas Clap and Ezra Stiles. They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, ""irrelevance"" of curricula, desperate need for endowment and disagreements with the Connecticut legislature.[36][37][page needed] Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for the study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the college from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. A 1746 graduate of Yale, Stiles came to the college with experience in education, having played an integral role in the founding of Brown University, in addition to having been a minister.[38] Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the college. However, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning, Secretary to the British General in command of the occupation, intervened and the college was saved. In 1803, Fanning was granted an honorary degree LL.D. for his efforts.[39] Students[edit] As the only college in Connecticut from 1701 to 1823, Yale educated the sons of the elite.[40] Punishable offenses for students included cardplaying, tavern-going, destruction of college property, and acts of disobedience to college authorities. During this period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side.[41] The emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such organizations were debating societies: Crotonia in 1738, Linonia in 1753 and Brothers in Unity in 1768. While the societies no longer exist, commemorations to them can be found with names given to campus structures, like Brothers in Unity Courtyard in Branford College. 19th century[edit] Old Brick Row in 1807 The Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. During this period, all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track curriculum. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because it was difficult for an institution to be completely modern or completely classical.[42][43] A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a person possessed of religious values strong enough to sufficiently resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without.[44][page needed] William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms of students. Sumner bested President Noah Porter, who disliked the social sciences and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. Porter objected to Sumner's use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students.[45] Until 1887, the legal name of the university was ""The President and Fellows of Yale College, in New Haven."" In 1887, under an act passed by the Connecticut General Assembly, Yale was renamed to the present ""Yale University.""[46] Sports and debate[edit] The Revolutionary War soldier Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the archetype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who ""regretted"" that he ""had but one life to lose"" for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in the combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied this same heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel Stover at Yale (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, the alumni, and the team itself.[47] Yale's four-oared crew team posing with the 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy, won in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Along with Harvard and Princeton, Yale students rejected British concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football.[48][page needed] The Harvard–Yale football rivalry began in 1875. Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates,[49][page needed] and in 1909 (the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale and Princeton) the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There were also rallies to send off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.[50] In 1909–10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905–06, which sought to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. Presidents Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate reforms to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. While the big three had attempted to operate independently of the majority, the changes pushed did reduce injuries.[51] Expansion[edit] Starting with the addition of the Yale School of Medicine in 1810, the college expanded gradually from then on, establishing the Yale Divinity School in 1822, Yale Law School in 1822, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1847, the now-defunct Sheffield Scientific School in 1847,[52] and the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1869. In 1887, under the presidency of Timothy Dwight V, Yale College was renamed to Yale University, and the former name was subsequently applied only to the undergraduate college. The university would continue to expand greatly into the 20th and 21st century, adding the Yale School of Music in 1894, the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies in 1900, the Yale School of Public Health in 1915, the Yale School of Architecture in 1916, the Yale School of Nursing 1923, the Yale School of Drama in 1955, the Yale School of Management in 1976, and the Jackson School of Global Affairs which is planned to open in 2022.[53] The Sheffield Scientific School would also reorganize its relationship with the university to teach only undergraduate courses. Expansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. Noah Porter, a moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership.[citation needed] Historian George Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.[54][page needed] Levesque continues, saying he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. Levesque concludes, mention how he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university. 20th century[edit] Medicine[edit] Woolsey Hall c. 1905 Milton Winternitz led the Yale School of Medicine as its dean from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about ""social medicine"" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the ""Yale System"" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the Psychiatry Department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to resign.[55] Faculty[edit] Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor of the Yale campus facing northBefore World War II, most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions.[56] Almost all members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—and some members of other faculties—teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually.[57] Women[edit] In 1793, Lucinda Foote passed the entrance exams for Yale College, but was rejected by the President on the basis of her gender.[58] Women studied at Yale University as early as 1892, in graduate-level programs at the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[59] In 1966, Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female and part of the Seven Sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the Ivy League when most Ivy League institutions still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969.[60] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate;[61] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall. The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year;[62] at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall at the south end of Old Campus.[63] A decade into co-education, student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit Alexander v. Yale. In the late 1970s, a group of students and one faculty member sued Yale for its failure to curtail campus sexual harassment by especially male faculty. The case was party built from a 1977 report authored by plaintiff Ann Olivarius, now a feminist attorney known for fighting sexual harassment, ""A report to the Yale Corporation from the Yale Undergraduate Women's Caucus.""[64] This case was the first to use Title IX to argue and establish that the sexual harassment of female students can be considered illegal sex discrimination. The plaintiffs in the case were Olivarius, Ronni Alexander (now a professor at Kobe University, Japan), Margery Reifler (works in the Los Angeles film industry), Pamela Price (civil rights attorney in California), and Lisa E. Stone (works at Anti-Defamation League). They were joined by Yale classics professor John “Jack” J. Winkler, who died in 1990. The lawsuit, brought partly by Catharine MacKinnon, alleged rape, fondling, and offers of higher grades for sex by several Yale faculty, including Keith Brion, professor of flute and Director of Bands, Political Science professor Raymond Duvall (now at the University of Minnesota), English professor Michael Cooke, and coach of the field hockey team, Richard Kentwell. While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale's Grievance Board and the Yale Women's Center.[65] In March 2011 a Title IX complaint was filed against Yale by students and recent graduates, including editors of Yale's feminist magazine Broad Recognition, alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate.[66] In response, the university formed a Title IX steering committee to address complaints of sexual misconduct.[67] Afterwards, universities and colleges throughout the US also established sexual harassment grievance procedures. Class[edit] Yale, like other Ivy League schools, instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to maintain the proportion of white Protestants from notable families in the student body (see numerus clausus), and was one of the last of the Ivies to eliminate such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970.[68] 21st century[edit] In 2006, Yale and Peking University (PKU) established a Joint Undergraduate Program in Beijing, an exchange program allowing Yale students to spend a semester living and studying with PKU honor students.[69] In July 2012, the Yale University-PKU Program ended due to weak participation.[69] In 2007 outgoing Yale President Rick Levin characterized Yale's institutional priorities: ""First, among the nation's finest research universities, Yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education. Second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in Yale College, we are committed to the education of leaders.""[70] In 2009, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair picked Yale as one location – the others being Britain's Durham University and Universiti Teknologi Mara – for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation's United States Faith and Globalization Initiative.[71] As of 2009, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is the director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar, ""Debating Globalization"".[72] As of 2009, former presidential candidate and DNC chair Howard Dean teaches a residential college seminar, ""Understanding Politics and Politicians"".[73] Also in 2009, an alliance was formed among Yale, University College London, and both schools' affiliated hospital complexes to conduct research focused on the direct improvement of patient care—a growing field known as translational medicine. President Richard Levin noted that Yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world, but ""no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with UCL"".[74] In August 2013, a new partnership with the National University of Singapore led to the opening of Yale-NUS College in Singapore, a joint effort to create a new liberal arts college in Asia featuring a curriculum including both Western and Asian traditions.[75] In 2020, in the wake of protests around the world focused on racial relations and criminal justice reform, the #CancelYale tag was used on social media to demand that Elihu Yale's name be removed from Yale University. Most support for the change stemmed from politically conservative pundits, such as Mike Cernovich and Ann Coulter, satirizing perceived excesses of online cancel culture.[76] Yale was president of the East India Company, a trading company that traded slaves as well as goods, [77] and his singularly large donation[78][79] led to Yale relying on money from the slave-trade for its first scholarships and endowments.[25][80] In August 2020, the US Justice Department claimed that Yale discriminated against Asian and white candidates on the basis of their race. The university, however, denied the report.[81] In early February 2021, under the new Biden administration, the Justice Department withdrew the lawsuit. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, known for a similar lawsuit against Harvard alleging the same issue, plans to refile the lawsuit.[82] Yale alumni in politics[edit] The Boston Globe wrote that ""if there's one school that can lay claim to educating the nation's top national leaders over the past three decades, it's Yale"".[83][verification needed] Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. presidential election between 1972 and 2004.[84] Yale-educated Presidents since the end of the Vietnam War include Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, and major-party nominees during this period include Hillary Clinton (2016), John Kerry (2004), Joseph Lieberman (Vice President, 2000), and Sargent Shriver (Vice President, 1972). Other Yale alumni who have made serious bids for the Presidency during this period include Amy Klobuchar (2020), Tom Steyer (2020), Ben Carson (2016), Howard Dean (2004), Gary Hart (1984 and 1988), Paul Tsongas (1992), Pat Robertson (1988) and Jerry Brown (1976, 1980, 1992). Several explanations have been offered for Yale's representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates.[85][verification needed] Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale's focus on creating ""a laboratory for future leaders,"" an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster.[85] Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: ""We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale.""[83] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes ""an ethos of organized activity"" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News.[86] Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: ""It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school.""[87] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the ""son and grandson of alumni"", and for a ""member of a politically influential family"".[88] New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and The Atlantic Monthly correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others.[89] During the 1988 presidential election, George H. W. Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis for having ""foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique"". When challenged on the distinction between Dukakis' Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was ""so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it"" and said Yale did not share Harvard's reputation for ""liberalism and elitism"".[90] In 2004 Howard Dean stated, ""In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of '68 and the class of '71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation"".[89] Administration and organization[edit] Leadership[edit] School founding School Year founded Yale College 1701 Yale School of Medicine 1810 Yale Divinity School 1822 Yale Law School 1843 Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences 1847 Sheffield Scientific School[52] 1847 Yale School of Fine Arts 1869 Yale School of Music 1894 Yale School of the Environment 1900 Yale School of Public Health 1915 Yale School of Architecture 1916 Yale School of Nursing 1923 David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University 1955 Yale School of Management 1976 Jackson School of Global Affairs Planned for fall 2022[53] The President and Fellows of Yale College, also known as the Yale Corporation, or board of trustees, is the governing body of the university and consists of thirteen standing committees with separate responsibilities outlined in the by-laws. The corporation has 19 members: three ex officio members, ten successor trustees, and six elected alumni fellows.[91] The university has three major academic components: Yale College (the undergraduate program), the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the twelve professional schools.[92] Yale's former president Richard C. Levin was, at the time, one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million.[93] Yale's succeeding president Peter Salovey ranks 40th with a 2020 salary of $1.16 million.[94] The Yale Provost's Office and similar executive positions have launched several women into prominent university executive positions. In 1977, Provost Hanna Holborn Gray was appointed interim President of Yale and later went on to become President of the University of Chicago, being the first woman to hold either position at each respective school.[95][96] In 1994, Provost Judith Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution at the University of Pennsylvania.[97] In 2002, Provost Alison Richard became the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge.[98] In 2003, the Dean of the Divinity School, Rebecca Chopp, was appointed president of Colgate University and later went on to serve as the President of the Swarthmore College in 2009, and then the first female chancellor of the University of Denver in 2014.[99] In 2004, Provost Dr. Susan Hockfield became the President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[100] In 2004, Dean of the Nursing school, Catherine Gilliss, was appointed the Dean of Duke University's School of Nursing and Vice Chancellor for Nursing Affairs.[101] In 2007, Deputy Provost H. Kim Bottomly was named President of Wellesley College.[102] Similar examples for men who've served in Yale leadership positions can also be found. In 2004, Dean of Yale College Richard H. Brodhead was appointed as the President of Duke University.[103] In 2008, Provost Andrew Hamilton was confirmed to be the Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford.[104] Staff and labor unions[edit] See also: Federation of Hospital and University Employees Yale University staff are represented by several different unions. Clerical and technical workers are represented by Local 34, and service and maintenance workers are represented by Local 35, both of the same union affiliate UNITE HERE.[105] Unlike similar institutions, Yale has consistently refused to recognize its graduate student union, Local 33 (another affiliate of UNITE HERE), citing claims that the union's elections were undemocratic and how graduate students are not employees;[106][107] the move to not recognize the union has been criticized by the American Federation of Teachers.[108] In addition, officers of the Yale University Police Department are represented by the Yale Police Benevolent Association, which affiliated in 2005 with the Connecticut Organization for Public Safety Employees.[105][109] Yale security officers joined the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America in late 2010,[110] even though the Yale administration contested the election.[111] In October 2014, after deliberation,[112] Yale security decided to form a new union, the Yale University Security Officers Association, which has since represented the campus security officers.[105][113] Yale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations, often culminating in strikes.[114][page needed] There have been at least eight strikes since 1968, and The New York Times wrote that Yale has a reputation as having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the U.S.[115] Moreover, Yale has been accused by the AFL–CIO of failing to treat workers with respect,[116] as well as not renewing contracts with professors over involvement in campus labor issues.[117] Yale has responded to strikes with claims over mediocre union participation and the benefits of their contracts.[118] Campus[edit] Yale Law School, located in the Sterling Law Building Interior of Beinecke Library Yale's central campus in downtown New Haven covers 260 acres (1.1 km2) and comprises its main, historic campus and a medical campus adjacent to the Yale–New Haven Hospital. In western New Haven, the university holds 500 acres (2.0 km2) of athletic facilities, including the Yale Golf Course.[119] In 2008, Yale purchased the 17-building, 136-acre (0.55 km2) former Bayer HealthCare complex in West Haven, Connecticut,[120] the buildings of which are now used as laboratory and research space.[121] Yale also owns seven forests in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire—the largest of which is the 7,840-acre (31.7 km2) Yale-Myers Forest in Connecticut's Quiet Corner—and nature preserves including Horse Island.[122] Yale is noted for its largely Collegiate Gothic campus[123] as well as several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: Louis Kahn's Yale Art Gallery[124] and Center for British Art, Eero Saarinen's Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph's Art & Architecture Building. Yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along Hillhouse Avenue, which was considered the most beautiful street in America by Charles Dickens when he visited the United States in the 1840s.[125] In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the Yale campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States.[126] Many of Yale's buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness, including the Yale Drama School.[127][128] Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities, such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes, like a policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid,[129] deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, 216 feet (66 m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon Statue of Nathan Hale in front of Connecticut Hall Vanderbilt Hall Other examples of the Gothic style are on the Old Campus by architects like Henry Austin, Charles C. Haight and Russell Sturgis. Several are associated with members of the Vanderbilt family, including Vanderbilt Hall,[130] Phelps Hall,[131] St. Anthony Hall (a commission for member Frederick William Vanderbilt), the Mason, Sloane and Osborn laboratories, dormitories for the Sheffield Scientific School (the engineering and sciences school at Yale until 1956) and elements of Silliman College, the largest residential college.[132] The oldest building on campus, Connecticut Hall (built in 1750), is in the Georgian style. Georgian-style buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include Timothy Dwight College, Pierson College, and Davenport College, except the latter's east, York Street façade, which was constructed in the Gothic style to coordinate with adjacent structures. The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books and manuscripts. The library includes a six-story above-ground tower of book stacks, filled with 180,000 volumes, that is surrounded by large translucent Vermont marble panels and a steel and granite truss. The panels act as windows and subdue direct sunlight while also diffusing the light in warm hues throughout the interior.[133] Near the library is a sunken courtyard, with sculptures by Isamu Noguchi that are said to represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube).[134] The library is located near the center of the university in Hewitt Quadrangle, which is now more commonly referred to as ""Beinecke Plaza."" Alumnus Eero Saarinen, Finnish-American architect of such notable structures as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Washington Dulles International Airport main terminal, Bell Labs Holmdel Complex and the CBS Building in Manhattan, designed Ingalls Rink, dedicated in 1959,[135] as well as the residential colleges Ezra Stiles and Morse.[136] These latter were modeled after the medieval Italian hill town of San Gimignano – a prototype chosen for the town's pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone towers.[137] These tower forms at Yale act in counterpoint to the college's many Gothic spires and Georgian cupolas.[138] Yale's Old Campus at dusk, April 2013 Notable nonresidential campus buildings[edit] Harkness Tower Notable nonresidential campus buildings and landmarks include Battell Chapel, Beinecke Rare Book Library, Harkness Tower, Ingalls Rink, Kline Biology Tower, Osborne Memorial Laboratories, Payne Whitney Gymnasium, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Sterling Hall of Medicine, Sterling Law Buildings, Sterling Memorial Library, Woolsey Hall, Yale Center for British Art, Yale University Art Gallery, Yale Art & Architecture Building, and the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art in London. Yale's secret society buildings (some of which are called ""tombs"") were built both to be private yet unmistakable. A diversity of architectural styles is represented: Berzelius, Donn Barber in an austere cube with classical detailing (erected in 1908 or 1910); Book and Snake, Louis R. Metcalfe in a Greek Ionic style (erected in 1901); Elihu, architect unknown but built in a Colonial style (constructed on an early 17th-century foundation although the building is from the 18th century); Mace and Chain, in a late colonial, early Victorian style (built in 1823). (Interior moulding is said to have belonged to Benedict Arnold);Manuscript Society, King Lui-Wu with Dan Kniley responsible for landscaping and Josef Albers for the brickwork intaglio mural. Building constructed in a mid-century modern style; Scroll and Key, Richard Morris Hunt in a Moorish- or Islamic-inspired Beaux-Arts style (erected 1869–70); Skull and Bones, possibly Alexander Jackson Davis or Henry Austin in an Egypto-Doric style utilizing Brownstone (in 1856 the first wing was completed, in 1903 the second wing, 1911 the Neo-Gothic towers in rear garden were completed); St. Elmo, (former tomb) Kenneth M. Murchison, 1912, designs inspired by Elizabethan manor. Current location, brick colonial; and Wolf's Head, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, erected 1923–1924, Collegiate Gothic. Sustainability[edit] Yale's Office of Sustainability develops and implements sustainability practices at Yale.[139] Yale is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10% below 1990 levels by the year 2020. As part of this commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by residential colleges.[140] Eleven campus buildings are candidates for LEED design and certification.[141] Yale Sustainable Food Project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all residential college dining halls.[142] Yale was listed as a Campus Sustainability Leader on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2008, and received a ""B+"" grade overall.[143] Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven Marsh Botanical Garden Yale Sustainable Food Program Farm Relationship with New Haven[edit] Yale is the largest taxpayer and employer in the City of New Haven,[144] and has often buoyed the city's economy and communities. Yale, however has consistently opposed paying a tax on its academic property.[145] Yale's Art Galleries, along with many other university resources, are free and openly accessible. Yale also funds the New Haven Promise program, paying full tuition for eligible students from New Haven public schools.[146] Town–gown relations[edit] Yale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.[147] Campus safety[edit] Several campus safety strategies have been pioneered at Yale. The first campus police force was founded at Yale in 1894, when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus.[148][149] Later hired by the university, the officers were originally brought in to quell unrest between students and city residents and curb destructive student behavior.[150][151] In addition to the Yale Police Department, a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a safety escort, and 24-hour shuttle service. In the 1970s and 1980s, poverty and violent crime rose in New Haven, dampening Yale's student and faculty recruiting efforts.[152] Between 1990 and 2006, New Haven's crime rate fell by half, helped by a community policing strategy by the New Haven Police and Yale's campus became the safest among the Ivy League and other peer schools.[153] In 2004, the national non-profit watchdog group Security on Campus filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, accusing Yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults.[154][155] In April 2021, Yale announced that it will require students to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of being on campus during the fall 2021 term.[156] Academics[edit] Admissions[edit] Admissions statistics2020 enteringclass[157]Change vs.2015[158]Admit rate6.5% ( −0.2)Yield rate54.9% ( −12)Test scores middle 50%SAT EBRW720–780SAT Math740–800ACT Composite33–35High school GPATop 10%†94% ( −3)†Among students whose school ranked Undergraduate admission to Yale College is considered ""most selective"" by U.S. News.[159][160] In 2017, Yale accepted 2,285 students to the Class of 2021 out of 32,914 applicants, for an acceptance rate of 6.9%.[161] 98% of students graduate within six years.[162] Through its program of need-based financial aid, Yale commits to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants. Most financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not need to be paid back to the university, and the average need-based aid grant for the Class of 2017 was $46,395.[163] 15% of Yale College students are expected to have no parental contribution, and about 50% receive some form of financial aid.[162][164][165] About 16% of the Class of 2013 had some form of student loan debt at graduation, with an average debt of $13,000 among borrowers.[162] Half of all Yale undergraduates are women, more than 39% are ethnic minority U.S. citizens (19% are underrepresented minorities), and 10.5% are international students.[163] 55% attended public schools and 45% attended private, religious, or international schools, and 97% of students were in the top 10% of their high school class.[162] Every year, Yale College also admits a small group of non-traditional students through the Eli Whitney Students Program. Collections[edit] Yale University's Sterling Memorial Library, as seen from Maya Lin's sculpture, Women's Table. The sculpture records the number of women enrolled at Yale over its history; female undergraduates were not admitted until 1969. Yale University Library, which holds over 15 million volumes, is the third-largest university collection in the United States.[13][166] The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject libraries. Rare books are found in several Yale collections. The Beinecke Rare Book Library has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The Lewis Walpole Library contains the largest collection of 18th‑century British literary works. The Elizabethan Club, technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale. The Night Café, Vincent van Gogh, 1888, Yale Art Gallery Yale's museum collections are also of international stature. The Yale University Art Gallery, the country's first university-affiliated art museum, contains more than 200,000 works, including Old Masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartwout and Kahn buildings. The latter, Louis Kahn's first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The Yale Center for British Art, the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of Paul Mellon and is housed in another Kahn-designed building. The Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments, affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of Yale's collections because its hours of opening are restricted. The museums once housed the artifacts brought to the United States from Peru by Yale history professor Hiram Bingham in his Yale-financed expedition to Machu Picchu in 1912 – when the removal of such artifacts was legal. The artifacts were restored to Peru in 2012.[167] Academic rankings National ARWU[168] 9 Forbes[169] 3 THE/WSJ[170] 3 U.S. News & World Report[171] 4 Washington Monthly[172] 4 Global ARWU[173] 11 QS[174] 14 THE[175] 8 U.S. News & World Report[176] 11 USNWR graduate school rankings[177] Business 9 Engineering 39 Law 1 Medicine: Primary Care 49 Medicine: Research 15 Nursing: Doctorate 17 Nursing: Master's 14 Rankings[edit] USNWR departmental rankings[177] Biological Sciences 6 Chemistry 9 Clinical Psychology 18 Computer Science 20 Earth Sciences 13 Economics 1 English 8 Fine Arts 2 History 1 Mathematics 9 Nursing–Midwifery 2 Physician Assistant 26 Physics 12 Political Science 4 Psychology 3 Public Health 15 Sociology 22 Statistics 31 The U.S. News & World Report ranked Yale 3rd among U.S. national universities for 2016,[159] as it had for each of the previous sixteen years.

(March 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Yale is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) and is classified among ""R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity"".[184] According to the National Science Foundation, Yale spent $990 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 15th in the nation.[185] Yale's faculty include 61 members of the National Academy of Sciences,[186] 7 members of the National Academy of Engineering[187] and 49 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The college is, after normalization for institution size, the tenth-largest baccalaureate source of doctoral degree recipients in the United States, and the largest such source within the Ivy League.[188] Yale's English and Comparative Literature departments were part of the New Criticism movement. Of the New Critics, Robert Penn Warren, W.K. Wimsatt, and Cleanth Brooks were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American deconstruction. Jacques Derrida, the father of deconstruction, taught at the Department of Comparative Literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called ""Yale School"". These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C. Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, David Montgomery, a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th century. The Journal of Music Theory was founded there in 1957; Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and scholars. In addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 Postdocs from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the Yale Postdoctoral Association. Campus life[edit] Yale is a research university, with the majority of its students in the graduate and professional schools. Undergraduates, or Yale College students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010–2011 freshman class, 10% are non‑U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.[189] The median family income of Yale students is $192,600, with 57% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 16% from the bottom 60%.[190] Residential colleges[edit] Main article: Residential colleges of Yale University Yale's residential college system was established in 1933 by Edward S. Harkness, who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as ""Master's Teas,"" but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college. All undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.[191] While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the Old Campus, the university's oldest precinct. While Harkness' original colleges were Georgian Revival or Collegiate Gothic in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history. In 2017, the university opened two new colleges near Science Hill.[192] Jonathan Edwards College courtyard Branford College courtyard Saybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard Hopper College courtyard Berkeley College buildings Trumbull College courtyard Davenport College courtyard Pierson College courtyard Silliman College courtyard Timothy Dwight College courtyard Morse College courtyard Ezra Stiles College courtyard Benjamin Franklin College courtyard Pauli Murray College courtyard Calhoun College[edit] Since the 1960s, John C. Calhoun's white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership[193][194][195][196] had prompted calls to rename the college or remove its tributes to Calhoun. The racially motivated church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, led to renewed calls in the summer of 2015 for Calhoun College, one of 12 residential colleges, to be renamed. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change.[194] They argued in the petition that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an ""extraordinary American statesman""—he was ""one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy"" in the history of the United States.[194][195] In August 2015 Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed.[196] He described Calhoun as ""a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina"".[196] He acknowledged that Calhoun also ""believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude. Not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests.""[193] Student activism about this issue increased in the fall of 2015, and included further protests sparked by controversy surrounding an administrator's comments on the potential positive and negative implications of students who wear Halloween costumes that are culturally sensitive.[197] Campus-wide discussions expanded to include critical discussion of the experiences of women of color on campus, and the realities of racism in undergraduate life.[198] The protests were sensationalized by the media and led to the labelling of some students as being members of Generation Snowflake.[199] In April 2016 Salovey announced that ""despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests,"" Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college[200] explaining that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun's ""shadow"" so they will be ""better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future"". He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would ""obscure"" his ""legacy of slavery rather than addressing it"".[200] ""Yale is part of that history"" and ""We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it."" One change that will be issued is the title of ""master"" for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to ""head of college"" due to its connotation of slavery.[201] Despite this apparently conclusive reasoning, Salovey announced that Calhoun College would be renamed for groundbreaking computer scientist Grace Murray Hopper in February 2017.[202] This renaming decision received a range of responses from Yale students and alumni.[203][204][205] Student organizations[edit] In 2014, Yale had 385 registered student organizations, plus an additional one hundred groups in the process of registration.[206] The university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. Established in 1872, The Yale Record is the world's oldest humor magazine. Newspapers include the Yale Daily News, which was first published in 1878, and the weekly Yale Herald, which was first published in 1986. The Yale Journal of Medicine & Law is a biannual magazine that explores the intersection of law and medicine. Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in New Haven. The Yale College Council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. The Yale Dramatic Association and Bulldog Productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. In addition, the Yale Drama Coalition[207] serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio[208] is the campus's radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM and FM frequencies, they now have an Internet-only stream. The Yale College Council (YCC) serves as the campus's undergraduate student government. All registered student organizations are regulated and funded by a subsidiary organization of the YCC, known as the Undergraduate Organizations Funding Committee (UOFC).[209] The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) serves as Yale's graduate and professional student government. The Yale Political Union is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry and George Pataki. The Yale International Relations Association (YIRA) functions as the umbrella organization for the top-ranked Model UN team. YIRA also has a Europe-based offshoot, Yale Model Government Europe, other Model UN conferences such as YMUN Korea or YMUN Taiwan, and educational programs such as the Yale Review of International Relations (YRIS), YMUN Institute, or Hemispheres. The campus includes several fraternities and sororities. The campus features at least 18 a cappella groups, the most famous of which is The Whiffenpoofs, which from its founding in 1909 until 2018 was made up solely of senior men. Yale's secret societies include Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, Wolf's Head, Book and Snake, Elihu, Berzelius, St. Elmo, Manuscript, Shabtai, Myth and Sword, Mace and Chain and Sage and Chalice. The two oldest existing honor societies are the Aurelian (1910) and the Torch Honor Society (1916).[210] The Elizabethan Club, a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. Membership is by invitation. Members and their guests may enter the ""Lizzie's"" premises for conversation and tea. The club owns first editions of a Shakespeare Folio, several Shakespeare Quartos, and a first edition of Milton's Paradise Lost, among other important literary texts. Traditions[edit] See also: Bladderball Yale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their ""bright college years,"" though in recent history the pipes have been replaced with ""bubble pipes"".[211][212] (""Bright College Years,"" the university's alma mater, was penned in 1881 by Henry Durand, Class of 1881, to the tune of Die Wacht am Rhein.) Yale's student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus; however, actual students rarely do so.[213] In the second half of the 20th century Bladderball, a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009, 2011, and 2014.[214][215][216] Athletic[edit] Main article: Yale Bulldogs The Yale Bowl, the college football stadium located near Yale University Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference, the Eastern College Athletic Conference, the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association. Yale athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the NCAA Division I level. Like other members of the Ivy League, Yale does not offer athletic scholarships. Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Yale Bowl (the nation's first natural ""bowl"" stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl), located at The Walter Camp Field athletic complex, and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world.[217] In May 2018, the men's lacrosse team defeated the Duke Blue Devils to claim their first ever NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship,[218] and are the first Ivy League school to win the title since the Princeton Tigers in 2001.[219] In 2016, the men's basketball team won the Ivy League Championship title for the first time in 54 years, earning a spot in the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In the first round of the tournament, the Bulldogs beat the Baylor Bears 79–75 in the school's first-ever tournament win.[220] The Walter Camp Gate at the Yale Athletic Complex October 21, 2000, marked the dedication of Yale's fourth new boathouse in 157 years of collegiate rowing. The Gilder Boathouse is named to honor former Olympic rower Virginia Gilder '79 and her father Richard Gilder '54, who gave $4 million towards the $7.5 million project. Yale also maintains the Gales Ferry site where the heavyweight men's team trains for the Yale-Harvard Boat Race. Yale crew is the oldest collegiate athletic team in America, and won Olympic Games Gold Medal for men's eights in 1924 and 1956. The Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate sailing club in the world. In 1896, Yale and Johns Hopkins played the first known ice hockey game in the United States. Since 2006, the school's ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game.[221] Yale students claim to have invented Frisbee, by tossing empty Frisbie Pie Company tins.[222][223] Yale athletics are supported by the Yale Precision Marching Band. ""Precision"" is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching.[224] The band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter. Yale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about ten different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup. Song[edit] Notable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement, convocation, alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, ""Bright College Years"". Despite its popularity, ""Boola Boola"" is not the official fight song, albeit being the origin of the university's unofficial motto. The official Yale fight song, ""Bulldog"" was written by Cole Porter during his undergraduate days and is sung after touchdowns during a football game.[225] Additionally, two other songs, ""Down the Field"" by C.W. O'Conner, and ""Bingo Eli Yale"", also by Cole Porter, are still sung at football games. According to College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology published in 1998, ""Down the Field"" ranks as the fourth-greatest fight song of all time.[226] Mascot[edit] The school mascot is ""Handsome Dan,"" the Yale bulldog, and the Yale fight song contains the refrain, ""Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow"". The school color, since 1894, is Yale Blue.[227] Yale's Handsome Dan is believed to be the first college mascot in America, having been established in 1889.[228] Notable people[edit] Benefactors[edit] Yale has had many financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. Among those who have made large donations commemorated at the university are: Elihu Yale; Jeremiah Dummer; the Harkness family (Edward, Anna, and William); the Beinecke family (Edwin, Frederick, and Walter); John William Sterling; Payne Whitney; Joseph Earl Sheffield, Paul Mellon, Charles B. G. Murphy, Joseph Tsai, and William K. Lanman. The Yale Class of 1954, led by Richard Gilder, donated $70 million in commemoration of their 50th reunion.[229] Charles B. Johnson, a 1954 graduate of Yale College, pledged a $250 million gift in 2013 to support the construction of two new residential colleges.[230] The colleges have been named respectively in honor of Pauli Murray and Benjamin Franklin. A $100 million contribution[231] by Stephen Adams enabled the Yale School of Music to become tuition-free and the Adams Center for Musical Arts to be built.

So-called “public Ivies” such as University of Michigan and Berkeley were not considered elite or even prestigious in the minds of evaluators (in contrast, these “state schools” were frequently described pejoratively as “safety schools” that were “just okay”). Even Ivy League designation was insufficient for inclusion in the super-elite. For undergraduate institutions, “top-tier” typically included only Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Stanford, and potentially Wharton (University of Pennsylvania’s Business School). By contrast, Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth, and University of Pennsylvania (general studies) were frequently described as “second tier” schools that were filled primarily with candidates who “didn’t get in” to a super-elite school. Definitions of “top-tier” were even narrower for professional schools, primarily referring to Yale, Harvard, Stanford, and to a lesser extent Columbia law schools... line feed character in |quote= at position 747 (help) ^ ""Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education College Rankings 2021"".

100,"Urban area - Wikipedia Urban area From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment ""Built up area"" redirects here. For the Highway Code, see Built-up area (Highway Code). ""Urban agglomeration"" redirects here. For city clusters, see Megalopolis. Greater Tokyo Area, Japan, the world's most populated urban area, with about 38 million inhabitants Greater Melbourne at night, seen from the International Space Station An urban area, or built-up area, is a human settlement with a high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets; in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources led to a human impact on the environment. ""Agglomeration effects"" are in the list of the main consequences of increased rates of firm creation since. This is due to conditions created by a greater level of industrial activity in a given region. However, a favorable environment for human capital development would also be generated simultaneously.[1] The world's urban population in 1950 of just 746 million has increased to 3.9 billion in the decades since.[2] In 2009, the number of people living in urban areas (3.42 billion) surpassed the number living in rural areas (3.41 billion), and since then the world has become more urban than rural.[3] This was the first time that the majority of the world's population lived in a city.[4] In 2014 there were 7.2 billion people living on the planet,[5] of which the global urban population comprised 3.9 billion. The Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs at that time predicted the urban population would grow to 6.4 billion by 2050, with 37% of that growth to come from three countries: China, India and Nigeria.[2] The UN publishes data on cities,urban areas and rural areas, but relies almost entirely on national definitions of these areas. The UN principles and recommendations state that due to different characteristics of urban and rural areas across the globe, a global definition is not possible.[6] Urban areas are created and further developed by the process of urbanization. Urban areas are measured for various purposes, including analyzing population density and urban sprawl. Unlike an urban area, a metropolitan area includes not only the urban area, but also satellite cities plus intervening rural land that is socio-economically connected to the urban core city, typically by employment ties through commuting, with the urban core city being the primary labor market. The concept of an ""urban area"" as used in economic statistics should not be confused with the concept of the ""urban area"" used in road safety statistics. The last concept is also known as ""built-up area in road safety"". According to the definition by the Office for National Statistics, ""Built-up areas are defined as land which is 'irreversibly urban in character', meaning that they are characteristic of a town or city. They include areas of built-up land with a minimum of 20 hectares (200,000 m2; 49 acres). Any areas [separated by] less than 200 metres [of non-urban space] are linked to become a single built-up area.[7] Urban land area (km2), 2010[8] Urban areas with at least one million inhabitants in 2006 Contents 1 Definitions 1.1 East Asia 1.1.1 China 1.1.2 Japan 1.2 South Asia 1.2.1 India 1.2.2 Pakistan 1.2.3 Bangladesh 1.3 Southeast Asia 1.3.1 Philippines 1.3.2 Vietnam 1.4 Europe 1.4.1 Finland 1.4.2 France 1.4.3 Germany 1.4.4 Netherlands 1.4.5 Sweden 1.4.6 United Kingdom 1.4.7 Norway 1.4.8 Poland 1.4.9 Russia 1.5 Oceania 1.5.1 Australia 1.5.2 New Zealand 1.6 North America 1.6.1 Canada 1.6.2 United States 1.7 South America 1.7.1 Argentina 1.7.2 Brazil 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Definitions[edit] European countries[which?] define urbanized areas on the basis of urban-type land use, not allowing any gaps of typically more than 200 metres (220 yd), and use satellite imagery instead of census blocks to determine the boundaries of the urban area. In less-developed countries[which?], in addition to land use and density requirements, a requirement that a large majority of the population, typically 75%, is not engaged in agriculture and/or fishing is sometimes used.[citation needed] East Asia[edit] China[edit] Main article: List of cities in China by population and built-up area Since 2000, China's cities have expanded at an average rate of 10% annually. It is estimated that China's urban population will increase by 292 million people by 2050,[2] when its cities will house a combined population of over one billion.[9] The country's urbanization rate increased from 17.4% to 46.6% between 1978 and 2009.[10] Between 150 and 200 million migrant workers work part-time in the major cities, returning home to the countryside periodically with their earnings.[11][12] Today, China has more cities with one million or more long-term residents than any other country, including the three global cities of Beijing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai; by 2025, the country will be home to 221 cities with over a million inhabitants.[9] The figures in the table below are from the 2008 census, and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations (which includes suburban and rural populations). The large ""floating populations"" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult;[13] the figures below include only long-term residents. Panoramic view of Pudong's Skyline from the Bund in Shanghai. Japan[edit] In Japan urbanized areas are defined as contiguous areas of densely inhabited districts (DIDs) using census enumeration districts as units with a density requirement of 4,000 inhabitants per square kilometre (10,000/sq mi). South Asia[edit] India[edit] Main articles: Urbanisation in India and List of cities in India by population For the Census of India 2011, the definition of urban area is a place having a minimum population of 5,000 of density 400 persons per square kilometre (1,000/sq mi) or higher, and 75% plus of the male working population employed in non-agricultural activities. Places administered by a municipal corporation, cantonment board or notified town area committee are automatically considered urban areas.[14] The Census of India 2011 also defined the term ""urban agglomeration"" as an integrated urban area consisting of a core town together with its ""outgrowths"" (contiguous suburbs).[15] India gate panorama. vteLargest urban agglomerations in India by population(2011 census)[16][17] MumbaiDelhiKolkataChennaiBangaloreHyderabad Rank City Name State/Territory Population Rank City Name State/Territory Population AhmedabadPuneSuratJaipurKanpurLucknow 1 Mumbai Maharashtra 18,394,912 28 Ludhiana Punjab 1,618,879 2 Delhi Delhi 16,349,831 29 Nashik Maharashtra 1,562,769 3 Kolkata West Bengal 14,112,536 30 Vijayawada Andhra Pradesh 1,491,202 4 Chennai Tamil Nadu 8,696,010 31 Madurai Tamil Nadu 1,465,625 5 Bengaluru Karnataka 8,520,435 32 Varanasi Uttar Pradesh 1,435,113 6 Hyderabad Telangana 7,749,334 33 Meerut Uttar Pradesh 1,424,908 7 Ahmedabad Gujarat 6,361,084 34 Faridabad Haryana 1,414,050 8 Pune Maharashtra 5,057,709 35 Rajkot Gujarat 1,390,933 9 Surat Gujarat 4,591,246 36 Jamshedpur Jharkhand 1,339,438 10 Jaipur Rajasthan 3,073,350 37 Srinagar Jammu and Kashmir 1,273,312 11 Kanpur Uttar Pradesh 2,920,496 38 Jabalpur Madhya Pradesh 1,268,848 12 Lucknow Uttar Pradesh 2,902,920 39 Asansol West Bengal 1,243,414 13 Nagpur Maharashtra 2,497,870 40 Vasai-Virar Maharashtra 1,222,390 14 Ghaziabad Uttar Pradesh 2,375,820 41 Allahabad Uttar Pradesh 1,216,719 15 Indore Madhya Pradesh 2,170,295 42 Dhanbad Jharkhand 1,196,214 16 Coimbatore Tamil Nadu 2,151,466 43 Aurangabad Maharashtra 1,193,167 17 Kochi Kerala 2,119,724 44 Amritsar Punjab 1,183,705 18 Patna Bihar 2,049,156 45 Jodhpur Rajasthan 1,138,300 19 Kozhikode Kerala 2,030,519 46 Ranchi Jharkhand 1,126,741 20 Bhopal Madhya Pradesh 1,886,100 47 Raipur Chhattisgarh 1,123,558 21 Thrissur Kerala 1,861,269 48 Kollam Kerala 1,110,668 22 Vadodara Gujarat 1,822,221 49 Gwalior Madhya Pradesh 1,102,884 23 Agra Uttar Pradesh 1,760,285 50 Bhilai Chhattisgarh 1,064,222 24 Vishakhapatnam Andhra Pradesh 1,730,320 51 Chandigarh Chandigarh 1,026,459 25 Malappuram Kerala 1,699,060 52 Tiruchirappalli Tamil Nadu 1,022,518 26 Thiruvananthapuram Kerala 1,687,406 53 Kota Rajasthan 1,001,694 27 Kannur Kerala 1,642,892 54 Mysore Karnataka 990,900 Pakistan[edit] Main articles: Urbanisation in Pakistan and List of most populous cities in Pakistan In Pakistan, an area is a major city and municipality if it has more than 100,000 inhabitants according to census results. Cities include adjacent cantonments. Urbanisation in Pakistan has increased since the time of independence and has several different causes. The majority of southern Pakistan's population lives along the Indus River. Karachi is its most populous city.[18] In the northern half of the country, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Gujrat, Jhelum, Sargodha, Sheikhupura, Nowshera, Mardan and Peshawar. During 1990–2008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.[19] Karachi is the most populated city in Pakistan closely followed by Lahore according to the 2017 Census. Bangladesh[edit] In Bangladesh, there are total 532 urban areas, which are divided into three categories. Those are City Corporation, Municipal Corporation (Pourasova) and Upazila town. Among those urban areas, Dhaka is the largest city by population and area, with a population of 19.10 million.[20] In Bangladesh, there are total 11 City Corporations and 329 Municipal Corporations and 203 Small towns, which serves as the center for Upazilas. According to 2011 population census, Bangladesh has an urban population of 28%, with a growth rate of 2.8%.[21] At this growth rate, it is estimated that the urban population of Bangladesh will reach 79 million or 42% of total population by 2035.

Europe[edit] Finland[edit] Main articles: Urban areas in Finland and List of urban areas in Finland by population A street sign indicating the beginning of an urban area in Finland. The picture was taken in Vimpeli. As in other Nordic countries, an urban area (taajama in Finnish) in Finland must have a building at least every 200 m (660 ft) and at least 200 people. To be considered a town or a city (kaupunki) for statistical purposes, an urban area must have at least 15,000 people. This is not to be confused with the city / town designation used by municipalities.[23][24] France[edit] Main article: Urban area (France) In France, an urban area (Fr: aire urbaine) is a zone encompassing an area of built-up growth (called an ""urban unit"" (unité urbaine)[25] – close in definition to the North American urban area) and its commuter belt (couronne). Americans would find the INSEE definition of the urban area[26] to be similar to their metropolitan area, and the INSEE sometimes uses the term aire métropolitaine[27] to refer to the country's largest aires urbaines. The largest cities in France, in terms of urban area population (2017), are Paris (12,628,266), Lyon (2,323,221), Marseille (1,760,653), Toulouse (1,360,829), Bordeaux (1,247,977), Lille (1,191,117), Nice (1,006,201), Nantes (972,828), Strasbourg (790,087) and Rennes (733,320).[28] Panorama of Paris as seen from the Eiffel Tower as full 360-degree view (river flowing from north-east to south-west, right to left) Germany[edit] Germany has a number of large cities. The largest conurbation is the Rhine-Ruhr region (11 million in 2008[update]), including Düsseldorf (the capital of North Rhine-Westphalia), Cologne, Bonn, Dortmund, Essen, Duisburg, and Bochum.[29] vte Largest urban agglomerations in GermanyFederal Statistical Office of Germany (31 December 2017) Rank Name State Pop.

The Randstad is the country's largest conurbation located in the west of the country and contains the four largest cities: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht. The Randstad has a population of 7 million inhabitants and is the 6th largest metropolitan area in Europe. Sweden[edit] Main article: List of urban areas in Sweden by population Urban areas in Sweden (tätorter) are statistically defined localities, totally independent of the administrative subdivision of the country. There are 1,956 such localities in Sweden, with a population ranging from 200 to 1,372,000 inhabitants.[30] United Kingdom[edit] Main article: List of urban areas in the United Kingdom In 2013 the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics (ONS) published 2011 Built-up Areas - Methodology and Guidance which sets out its definition of a built-up area as an area of built-up land of at least 20 hectares (0.077 sq mi), separated from other settlements by at least 200 metres (660 ft). For 2011 census data there are 5,493 built-up areas, of which 501 are divided into sub-divisions for which data is also available. Each built-up area is named algorithmically, using Ordnance Survey place-name data.[31] The ONS has produced census results from urban areas since 1951, since 1981 based upon the extent of irreversible urban development indicated on Ordnance Survey maps. The definition is an extent of at least 20 ha and at least 1,500 census residents. Separate areas are linked if less than 200 m (220 yd) apart.

Unlike in Denmark and Sweden, the distance between each building has to be of less than 50 m, although exceptions are made due to parks, industrial areas, rivers, and similar. Groups of houses less than 400 m from the main body of an urban area are included in the urban area.[36] Poland[edit] In Poland, official ""urban"" population figures simply refer to those localities which have the status of towns (miasta). The ""rural"" population is that of all areas outside the boundaries of these towns. This distinction may give a misleading impression in some cases, since some localities with only village status may have acquired larger and denser populations than many many smaller towns.[37] On the other hand, the Upper Silesian Industrial Region covers 3,200 km and has approximately 3 million people. Russia[edit] Moscow, the capital and largest city of Russia, has a population estimated at 12.4 million residents within the city limits,[38] while over 17 million residents in the urban area,[39] and over 20 million residents in the Moscow Metropolitan Area.[40] It is among the world's largest cities, being the most populous city entirely within Europe, the most populous urban area in Europe,[39] the most populous metropolitan area in Europe,[40] and also the largest city by land area on the European continent.[41] Saint Petersburg, the cultural capital, is the second-largest city, with a population of roughly 5.4 million inhabitants.[42] Other major urban areas are Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, and Chelyabinsk. Moscow, the capital and largest city of Russia Saint Petersburg, the cultural capital and the second-largest city Yekaterinburg, the fourth-largest city in the country. Oceania[edit] Australia[edit] In Australia, urban areas are referred to as ""urban centres"" and are defined as population clusters of 1,000 or more people, with a density of at least 200/km2 (518/sq mi)[43] Australia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world, with more than 50% of the population residing in Australia's three biggest urban centres. Sydney is Australia's largest city, home to 5.3 million inhabitants.[44] New Zealand[edit] Main article: Urban areas of New Zealand Statistics New Zealand defines urban areas in New Zealand, which are independent of any administrative subdivisions and have no legal basis.[45] There are three classes of urban area: main urban areas are the 17 urban areas which have a population of 30,000 or more; secondary urban areas are the 14 urban areas which have a population of 10,000 or more but less than 30,000, and minor urban areas are the 103 urban areas which have a population of 1,000 or more but less than 10,000. Urban areas are reclassified after each New Zealand census, so population changes between censuses does not change an urban area's classification. North America[edit] Canada[edit] Main article: List of the 100 largest population centres in Canada According to Statistics Canada, an urban area in Canada is an area with a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per square kilometre (1,000/sq mi).[46] If two or more urban areas are within 2 km (1.2 mi) of each other by road, they are merged into a single urban area, provided they do not cross census metropolitan area or census agglomeration boundaries.[47] In the Canada 2011 Census, Statistics Canada redesignated urban areas with the new term ""population centre"";[48] the new term was chosen in order to better reflect the fact that urban vs. rural is not a strict division, but rather a continuum within which several distinct settlement patterns may exist. For example, a community may fit a strictly statistical definition of an urban area, but may not be commonly thought of as ""urban"" because it has a smaller population, or functions socially and economically as a suburb of another urban area rather than as a self-contained urban entity, or is geographically remote from other urban communities. Accordingly, the new definition set out three distinct types of population centres: small (population 1,000 to 29,999), medium (population 30,000 to 99,999) and large (population 100,000 or greater).[48] Despite the change in terminology, however, the demographic definition of a population centre remains unchanged from that of an urban area: a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per km2. United States[edit] Main article: List of United States urban areas In the United States, there are two categories of urban area. The term urbanized area denotes an urban area of 50,000 or more people. Urban areas under 50,000 people are called urban clusters. Urbanized areas were first delineated in the United States in the 1950 census, while urban clusters were added in the 2000 census. There are 1,371 urban areas and urban clusters with more than 10,000 people. The U.S. Census Bureau defines an urban area as ""core census block groups or blocks that have a population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile (386 per square kilometer) and surrounding census blocks that have an overall density of at least 500 people per square mile (193 per square kilometer)"".[49] The largest urban area in the United States is the New York metropolitan area. The population of New York City, the core of the metropolitan area, exceeds 8.5 million people, its metropolitan statistical area has a population that is over 20 million, and its combined statistical area population is over 23 million. The next seven largest urban areas in the U.S. are Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Houston, and Atlanta.[50] About 82 percent of the population of the United States lives within the boundaries of an urbanized area as of December, 2010.[51] Combined, these areas occupy about 2 percent of the land area of the United States. Many Americans live in agglomerations of cities, suburbs, and towns that are adjacent to a metropolitan area's largest city.[citation needed] The skyscrapers of New York City, the most populous city in the United States and the most populous U.S. metropolitan area, are almost all situated in Manhattan, the world's largest central business district, seen here in this panorama in February 2018, as viewed from Weehawken, New Jersey.

For example, the city of Greenville, South Carolina has a city population just over 68,000 and an urbanized area population of around 400,000, while Greensboro, North Carolina has a city population just over 285,000 and an urbanized area population of around 300,000 — meaning that Greenville is actually ""larger"" for some intents and purposes, but not for others, such as taxation, local elections, etc. In the U.S. Department of Agriculture's natural resources inventory, urban areas are officially known as developed areas or urban and built-up areas. Such areas include cities, ethnic villages, other built-up areas of more than 10 ac (4 ha), industrial sites, railroad yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, shooting ranges, institutional and public administration sites, and similar areas. The 1997 national resources inventory placed over 98,000,000 ac (40,000,000 ha) in this category, an increase of 25,000,000 ac (10,000,000 ha) since 1982.[52] South America[edit] Argentina[edit] Argentina is highly urbanized.[53] The ten largest metropolitan areas account for half of the population, and fewer than one in ten live in rural areas. About 3 million people live in Buenos Aires City and the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area totals around 15 million, making it one of the largest urban areas in the world, with a population of 18 million all up.[54] Córdoba has around 1.5 million people living in the urban area, while Rosario, Mendoza and Tucumán have around 1.2 million inhabitants each[54] and La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe[54][55] have at least 500,000 people each. Brazil[edit] Main article: List of largest cities in Brazil According to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) urban areas already concentrate 84.35% of the population, while the Southeast region remains the most populated one, with over 80 million inhabitants.[56] The largest metropolitan areas in Brazil are São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte — all in the Southeastern Region — with 21, 12, and 5 million inhabitants respectively.[57] In general, state capitals are the largest cities in their states, except for Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, and Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina. There are also non-capital metropolitan areas in the states of São Paulo (Campinas, Santos and the Paraíba Valley), Minas Gerais (Steel Valley), Rio Grande do Sul (Sinos Valley) and Santa Catarina (Itajaí Valley).[58] São Paulo, the largest city in Brazil, the largest city proper in the Southern Hemisphere, in the Americas, and the world's ninth-largest urban area by population.[59] vte Largest urban agglomerations in Brazil2017 Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics estimates[60][61][62] Rank Name State Pop.

Yale University reinstitutes face covering policy NEW HAVEN, CT (WFSB) - Yale University has reinstituted their mask mandate. On Monday, Quinnipiac University said it too will require the community, regardless of vaccination status, to wear a face mask inside at all indoor campus spaces.“Following are the only times it is not needed to wear a face mask: When outdoors; when alone in a private office or a partitioned cubicle/workspace, or in your living space; When eating in dining halls (masks must be worn at all other times in dining halls),” a letter to students said.Also on Monday, the University of New Haven said based on the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control, the Dept. of Public Health, and due to the increases in COVID transmission rates, all individuals will be required to wear face coverings when inside any university building, regardless of vaccination status.UNH officials said they will reassess the need for indoor masks weekly, based on the latest federal and state guidance. ""We’re checking to see what’s the appropriate to take, and we’ll continue to have that conversation so that districts can have that information as soon as possible,"" Acting Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker of the Dept. of Education said. As college students prepare to return to campus, more institutions are bringing back a mask mandate, including the University of New Haven. Colleges and universities are not alone in bringing back mask mandates.

(December 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The High Street of Oxford, a prototypical example of a university town. There is no central campus, rather university buildings are scattered around the city between shops, for example those at centre right of the picture. A college town or university town is a community (often a separate town or city, but in some cases a town/city neighborhood or a district) that is dominated by its university population. The university may be large, or there may be several smaller institutions such as liberal arts colleges clustered, or the residential population may be small, but college towns in all cases are so dubbed because the presence of the educational institution(s) pervades economic and social life. Many local residents may be employed by the university—which may be the largest employer in the community—many businesses cater primarily to the university, and the student population may outnumber the local population. Contents 1 Description 2 Town–gown relations 3 Settlement in college towns 4 See also 5 Notes 6 References Description[edit] Kuopio, North Savonia, home to the Savonia University of Applied Sciences In Europe, a university town is generally characterised by having an ancient university. The economy of the city is closely related with the university activity and highly supported by the entire university structure, which may include university hospitals and clinics, printing houses, libraries, laboratories, business incubators, student rooms, dining halls, students' unions, student societies, and academic festivities. Moreover, the history of the city is often intertwined with that of the university. Many European university towns have not been merely important places of science and education, but also centres of political, cultural and social influence throughout the centuries.[1] As an example of this, Paris also illustrates the course of educational history with the Sorbonne and the Grande école.[2] Besides a highly educated and largely transient population, a stereotypical college town often has many people in non-traditional lifestyles and subcultures and with a high tolerance for unconventionality in general, and has a very active musical or cultural scene. The majority of the population is usually politically liberal.[citation needed] Many have become centres of technological research and innovative startups. Universities with start-up centers can be large cities like Munich, but also small cities like Trieste.[3] Although the concept of a university town has developed since the European Middle Ages, equivalents already existed in earlier times and in non-European cultures. For example, in later Classical times the city of Athens – no longer having any political or military power, but renowned as the greatest center of learning in the Roman Empire – had many of the characteristics of a university town, and is sometimes called such by modern scholars. Town–gown relations[edit] Main article: Town and gown Ann Arbor, Michigan, home to the University of Michigan As in the case of a company town, the large and transient university population may come into conflict with other townspeople. Students may come from outside the area, and perhaps subscribe to a different—sometimes radically different—culture.[citation needed] Most students are young people, whose living habits may be different from older people. Economically, the high spending power of the university and of its students in aggregate may inflate the cost of living above that of the region. It is common for university employees to commute from surrounding areas, finding the cost of living in town too expensive.[citation needed] Studentification, in which a growing student population move in large numbers to traditionally non-student neighborhoods, may be perceived as a form of invasion or gentrification. It may be due to university enrollment expanding beyond the capacity of on-campus housing, inadequate zoning enforcement, and/or student culture. Neighborhood associations may work to limit conversion of family homes to student rentals, while some local residents may oppose the construction of large on-campus dormitories or expansion of fraternity and sorority houses, forcing a growing enrollment to seek housing in town. Moreover, a single-family home can be converted into several smaller rental units, or shared by a number of students whose combined resources exceed those of a typical single-family rental—a strong incentive for absentee landlords to cater to students.[citation needed] In the US, educational institutions are often exempted from local taxes, so in the absence of a system for payments in lieu of taxes, the university population will disproportionately burden parts of the local public infrastructure, such as roads or law enforcement. Some analysts argue that students relieve the burden on other parts of the local public infrastructure, such as local primary and secondary schools, by far the most costly line item in most North American city and town budgets, by providing tax revenues through local sales tax and property tax paid by landlords. When a university expands its facilities, the potential loss of property tax revenue is thus a concern, in addition to local desire to preserve open space or historic neighborhoods. As a result, local people may resent the university and its students.[citation needed] The students, in turn, may criticize the local residents' taking jobs at the university provided by student tuition and fees, and accepting the tax revenues (e.g. local sales tax, property tax on rented properties) that students generate, but resenting students' lifestyles. Some students refer to other inhabitants as ""townies"", a term with somewhat derogatory connotations. This ""town and gown"" dichotomy notwithstanding, students and the outside community typically find a peaceful (even friendly) coexistence, with the town receiving significant economic and cultural benefits from the university, and the students often adapting to the culture of the town.[citation needed] Settlement in college towns[edit] Claremont, California, home to the Claremont Colleges While noise, traffic, and other quality of life issues have not been resolved, some advocates of New Urbanism have led the development of neighborhoods in college towns by specifically capitalizing on their proximity to university life. For instance, some universities have developed properties to allow faculty and staff members to walk to work, reducing demand for limited on-campus parking; Duke University's Trinity Heights development is a key example. In many cases, developers have built communities where access to the university (even if not directly adjacent) is promoted as an advantage. Student housing is also an important component of college towns. In the United States most state universities have 50 percent or more of their enrolled students living off-campus. This trend, which began in the 1960s, originally meant the conversion of near campus single-family homes to student housing, creating ""student ghettos."" Cambridge, home to the University of Cambridge Colleges and other developers began building purpose-built off-campus student housing areas in the 1970s in more college towns. Beginning around 2000 in the United States, nationwide real estate investment trusts (REIT) and publicly traded corporations began developing student housing complexes. Another notable development since the 1990s is the surge in popularity of retirees relocating to college towns. Retirees are attracted to these locations because of cultural and educational opportunities, college athletic events, good medical facilities (often at teaching hospitals affiliated with medical schools), a low cost of living, and often a pedestrian- or public transit-friendly development pattern. Several development companies now specialize in constructing retirement communities in college towns. In some cases the communities have developed formal relationships with the local institution. The demand for housing from students, faculty, staff, and retirees has kept college town home prices stable during the housing market downturn that began in 2005.[4] See also[edit] List of college towns Student quarter Town and gown Company town Notes[edit] ^ Christian Cwik, Michael Zeuske ""Rettet die Unis und die Unistädte"", In: science-ORF 14 June 2020. ^ Pierre Bourdieu, Monique de Saint Martin, ""La Noblesse d’État.

106,"Dance prof’s documentary wins at Cannes Indies Cinema Awards – YFile Home Top Stories Current News Research Bookshelf COVID-19 More about YFile Dance prof's documentary wins at Cannes Indies Cinema Awards July 28, 2021 A film by York University Associate Professor Patrick Alcedo earned the Best Short Documentary award at the Cannes Indies Cinema Awards on July 10. The film, titled They Call Me Dax, tells the story of 15-year-old Dorothy Echipare who struggles to survive as a high-school student and ballet dancer while living alone in a poor urban district in Quezon City, Philippines. “I was elated and surprised when I learned that my new short docu won, as it was an international online competition,” said Alcedo. Chair of the Department of Dance in York’s School of the Arts, Media, Performance & Design (AMPD), Alcedo has directed, written and produced three documentary films in the past year. Two of his other documentary films – A Will To Dream and Am I Being Selfish? – also won, respectively, Best Dance Feature Documentary and Best Inspirational Short Documentary at the Silk Road Film Awards Cannes in May. This same competition singled out They Call Me Dax as Best Dance Short Documentary. The three films put a spotlight on issues of teenage pregnancy, illegal drugs, precarity of labour and inconsistent governmental support in poverty alleviation in the Philippines. They illustrate how dance, when partnered with grit and altruistic teaching, has the potential to navigate and even overcome these social, economic and political issues. Patrick Alcedo “As a dance ethnographer, I am passionate about putting an emphasis on dance’s ability to empower the marginalized. I want to illustrate that dance, as lived in the lives of its practitioners, is an incredible embodied form in understanding the complexities of race, class, ethnicity, gender, religious practices and diasporic/transnational identities,” said Alcedo. “As a Philippine studies scholar and a Filipino, I devote my energies and resources to fleshing out who Filipinos are, whether in the Philippines or in transnational elsewhere – from the point of view of dance, from their own dancing and choreographed bodies.” Along the same vein of marginality as Dorothy’s story, Am I Being Selfish? focuses on the life of her fellow dancer, Jon-Jon Bides. Despite the resulting financial hardship, Jon-Jon insists on supporting his wife and two young sons by teaching ballet to poor children and at-risk youth, like Dorothy. The feature-length documentary, A Will To Dream, anchors its narrative in the life of Luther Perez, a former ballet star in the Philippines and Dorothy and Jon-Jon’s mentor and adoptive father. To give underprivileged children and youth from squatters’ areas in Quezon City and Manila a shot in life, he surrendered his U.S. green card – and with it the promise of a better life abroad – to teach them dance. To date, these films have garnered six official selections from film festivals and award-giving bodies such as the New York Independent Cinema Awards, International Shorts, Lift-Off Online Sessions and the Chicago Indie Film Awards. Alcedo’s latest win at the Cannes Indies has caught the attention of three television stations – DZRH News of the Manila Broadcasting Corporation, Net25 and Omni Filipino News – that together have thus far garnered more than 28,000 views. The three films build on Alcedo’s 20-minute documentary Dancing Manilenyos, which was an official selection at the 2019 Diversity in Cannes Short Film Showcase and received an Award of Merit from the 2019 Global Shorts Competition and an Award of Recognition from the 2018 Hollywood International Independent Documentary Awards. These three recent films would not have been possible if not for the team that Alcedo has put together. Behind these works are cinematographer Alex Felipe, editor and colourist Alec Bell, and transcriber Paulo Alcedo – all York University alumni. Additional cinematography is from John Marie Soberano and archival footage is from both Mark Gary and Denisa Reyes. Peter Alcedo Jr. did the musical scoring. The pre-production, production and post-production of Alcedo’s films have received support from AMPD, the York Centre for Asian Research, the government of Ontario’s Early Researcher Awards program, the Canada Council for the Arts, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council's Research-Creation Grant.

108,"Urban area - Wikipedia Urban area From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment ""Built up area"" redirects here. For the Highway Code, see Built-up area (Highway Code). ""Urban agglomeration"" redirects here. For city clusters, see Megalopolis. Greater Tokyo Area, Japan, the world's most populated urban area, with about 38 million inhabitants Greater Melbourne at night, seen from the International Space Station An urban area, or built-up area, is a human settlement with a high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets; in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources led to a human impact on the environment. ""Agglomeration effects"" are in the list of the main consequences of increased rates of firm creation since. This is due to conditions created by a greater level of industrial activity in a given region. However, a favorable environment for human capital development would also be generated simultaneously.[1] The world's urban population in 1950 of just 746 million has increased to 3.9 billion in the decades since.[2] In 2009, the number of people living in urban areas (3.42 billion) surpassed the number living in rural areas (3.41 billion), and since then the world has become more urban than rural.[3] This was the first time that the majority of the world's population lived in a city.[4] In 2014 there were 7.2 billion people living on the planet,[5] of which the global urban population comprised 3.9 billion. The Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs at that time predicted the urban population would grow to 6.4 billion by 2050, with 37% of that growth to come from three countries: China, India and Nigeria.[2] The UN publishes data on cities,urban areas and rural areas, but relies almost entirely on national definitions of these areas. The UN principles and recommendations state that due to different characteristics of urban and rural areas across the globe, a global definition is not possible.[6] Urban areas are created and further developed by the process of urbanization. Urban areas are measured for various purposes, including analyzing population density and urban sprawl. Unlike an urban area, a metropolitan area includes not only the urban area, but also satellite cities plus intervening rural land that is socio-economically connected to the urban core city, typically by employment ties through commuting, with the urban core city being the primary labor market. The concept of an ""urban area"" as used in economic statistics should not be confused with the concept of the ""urban area"" used in road safety statistics. The last concept is also known as ""built-up area in road safety"". According to the definition by the Office for National Statistics, ""Built-up areas are defined as land which is 'irreversibly urban in character', meaning that they are characteristic of a town or city. They include areas of built-up land with a minimum of 20 hectares (200,000 m2; 49 acres). Any areas [separated by] less than 200 metres [of non-urban space] are linked to become a single built-up area.[7] Urban land area (km2), 2010[8] Urban areas with at least one million inhabitants in 2006 Contents 1 Definitions 1.1 East Asia 1.1.1 China 1.1.2 Japan 1.2 South Asia 1.2.1 India 1.2.2 Pakistan 1.2.3 Bangladesh 1.3 Southeast Asia 1.3.1 Philippines 1.3.2 Vietnam 1.4 Europe 1.4.1 Finland 1.4.2 France 1.4.3 Germany 1.4.4 Netherlands 1.4.5 Sweden 1.4.6 United Kingdom 1.4.7 Norway 1.4.8 Poland 1.4.9 Russia 1.5 Oceania 1.5.1 Australia 1.5.2 New Zealand 1.6 North America 1.6.1 Canada 1.6.2 United States 1.7 South America 1.7.1 Argentina 1.7.2 Brazil 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Definitions[edit] European countries[which?] define urbanized areas on the basis of urban-type land use, not allowing any gaps of typically more than 200 metres (220 yd), and use satellite imagery instead of census blocks to determine the boundaries of the urban area. In less-developed countries[which?], in addition to land use and density requirements, a requirement that a large majority of the population, typically 75%, is not engaged in agriculture and/or fishing is sometimes used.[citation needed] East Asia[edit] China[edit] Main article: List of cities in China by population and built-up area Since 2000, China's cities have expanded at an average rate of 10% annually. It is estimated that China's urban population will increase by 292 million people by 2050,[2] when its cities will house a combined population of over one billion.[9] The country's urbanization rate increased from 17.4% to 46.6% between 1978 and 2009.[10] Between 150 and 200 million migrant workers work part-time in the major cities, returning home to the countryside periodically with their earnings.[11][12] Today, China has more cities with one million or more long-term residents than any other country, including the three global cities of Beijing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai; by 2025, the country will be home to 221 cities with over a million inhabitants.[9] The figures in the table below are from the 2008 census, and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations (which includes suburban and rural populations). The large ""floating populations"" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult;[13] the figures below include only long-term residents. Panoramic view of Pudong's Skyline from the Bund in Shanghai. Japan[edit] In Japan urbanized areas are defined as contiguous areas of densely inhabited districts (DIDs) using census enumeration districts as units with a density requirement of 4,000 inhabitants per square kilometre (10,000/sq mi). South Asia[edit] India[edit] Main articles: Urbanisation in India and List of cities in India by population For the Census of India 2011, the definition of urban area is a place having a minimum population of 5,000 of density 400 persons per square kilometre (1,000/sq mi) or higher, and 75% plus of the male working population employed in non-agricultural activities. Places administered by a municipal corporation, cantonment board or notified town area committee are automatically considered urban areas.[14] The Census of India 2011 also defined the term ""urban agglomeration"" as an integrated urban area consisting of a core town together with its ""outgrowths"" (contiguous suburbs).[15] India gate panorama. vteLargest urban agglomerations in India by population(2011 census)[16][17] MumbaiDelhiKolkataChennaiBangaloreHyderabad Rank City Name State/Territory Population Rank City Name State/Territory Population AhmedabadPuneSuratJaipurKanpurLucknow 1 Mumbai Maharashtra 18,394,912 28 Ludhiana Punjab 1,618,879 2 Delhi Delhi 16,349,831 29 Nashik Maharashtra 1,562,769 3 Kolkata West Bengal 14,112,536 30 Vijayawada Andhra Pradesh 1,491,202 4 Chennai Tamil Nadu 8,696,010 31 Madurai Tamil Nadu 1,465,625 5 Bengaluru Karnataka 8,520,435 32 Varanasi Uttar Pradesh 1,435,113 6 Hyderabad Telangana 7,749,334 33 Meerut Uttar Pradesh 1,424,908 7 Ahmedabad Gujarat 6,361,084 34 Faridabad Haryana 1,414,050 8 Pune Maharashtra 5,057,709 35 Rajkot Gujarat 1,390,933 9 Surat Gujarat 4,591,246 36 Jamshedpur Jharkhand 1,339,438 10 Jaipur Rajasthan 3,073,350 37 Srinagar Jammu and Kashmir 1,273,312 11 Kanpur Uttar Pradesh 2,920,496 38 Jabalpur Madhya Pradesh 1,268,848 12 Lucknow Uttar Pradesh 2,902,920 39 Asansol West Bengal 1,243,414 13 Nagpur Maharashtra 2,497,870 40 Vasai-Virar Maharashtra 1,222,390 14 Ghaziabad Uttar Pradesh 2,375,820 41 Allahabad Uttar Pradesh 1,216,719 15 Indore Madhya Pradesh 2,170,295 42 Dhanbad Jharkhand 1,196,214 16 Coimbatore Tamil Nadu 2,151,466 43 Aurangabad Maharashtra 1,193,167 17 Kochi Kerala 2,119,724 44 Amritsar Punjab 1,183,705 18 Patna Bihar 2,049,156 45 Jodhpur Rajasthan 1,138,300 19 Kozhikode Kerala 2,030,519 46 Ranchi Jharkhand 1,126,741 20 Bhopal Madhya Pradesh 1,886,100 47 Raipur Chhattisgarh 1,123,558 21 Thrissur Kerala 1,861,269 48 Kollam Kerala 1,110,668 22 Vadodara Gujarat 1,822,221 49 Gwalior Madhya Pradesh 1,102,884 23 Agra Uttar Pradesh 1,760,285 50 Bhilai Chhattisgarh 1,064,222 24 Vishakhapatnam Andhra Pradesh 1,730,320 51 Chandigarh Chandigarh 1,026,459 25 Malappuram Kerala 1,699,060 52 Tiruchirappalli Tamil Nadu 1,022,518 26 Thiruvananthapuram Kerala 1,687,406 53 Kota Rajasthan 1,001,694 27 Kannur Kerala 1,642,892 54 Mysore Karnataka 990,900 Pakistan[edit] Main articles: Urbanisation in Pakistan and List of most populous cities in Pakistan In Pakistan, an area is a major city and municipality if it has more than 100,000 inhabitants according to census results. Cities include adjacent cantonments. Urbanisation in Pakistan has increased since the time of independence and has several different causes. The majority of southern Pakistan's population lives along the Indus River. Karachi is its most populous city.[18] In the northern half of the country, most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Gujrat, Jhelum, Sargodha, Sheikhupura, Nowshera, Mardan and Peshawar. During 1990–2008, city dwellers made up 36% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia. Furthermore, 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.[19] Karachi is the most populated city in Pakistan closely followed by Lahore according to the 2017 Census. Bangladesh[edit] In Bangladesh, there are total 532 urban areas, which are divided into three categories. Those are City Corporation, Municipal Corporation (Pourasova) and Upazila town. Among those urban areas, Dhaka is the largest city by population and area, with a population of 19.10 million.[20] In Bangladesh, there are total 11 City Corporations and 329 Municipal Corporations and 203 Small towns, which serves as the center for Upazilas. According to 2011 population census, Bangladesh has an urban population of 28%, with a growth rate of 2.8%.[21] At this growth rate, it is estimated that the urban population of Bangladesh will reach 79 million or 42% of total population by 2035.

Europe[edit] Finland[edit] Main articles: Urban areas in Finland and List of urban areas in Finland by population A street sign indicating the beginning of an urban area in Finland. The picture was taken in Vimpeli. As in other Nordic countries, an urban area (taajama in Finnish) in Finland must have a building at least every 200 m (660 ft) and at least 200 people. To be considered a town or a city (kaupunki) for statistical purposes, an urban area must have at least 15,000 people. This is not to be confused with the city / town designation used by municipalities.[23][24] France[edit] Main article: Urban area (France) In France, an urban area (Fr: aire urbaine) is a zone encompassing an area of built-up growth (called an ""urban unit"" (unité urbaine)[25] – close in definition to the North American urban area) and its commuter belt (couronne). Americans would find the INSEE definition of the urban area[26] to be similar to their metropolitan area, and the INSEE sometimes uses the term aire métropolitaine[27] to refer to the country's largest aires urbaines. The largest cities in France, in terms of urban area population (2017), are Paris (12,628,266), Lyon (2,323,221), Marseille (1,760,653), Toulouse (1,360,829), Bordeaux (1,247,977), Lille (1,191,117), Nice (1,006,201), Nantes (972,828), Strasbourg (790,087) and Rennes (733,320).[28] Panorama of Paris as seen from the Eiffel Tower as full 360-degree view (river flowing from north-east to south-west, right to left) Germany[edit] Germany has a number of large cities. The largest conurbation is the Rhine-Ruhr region (11 million in 2008[update]), including Düsseldorf (the capital of North Rhine-Westphalia), Cologne, Bonn, Dortmund, Essen, Duisburg, and Bochum.[29] vte Largest urban agglomerations in GermanyFederal Statistical Office of Germany (31 December 2017) Rank Name State Pop.

The Randstad is the country's largest conurbation located in the west of the country and contains the four largest cities: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht. The Randstad has a population of 7 million inhabitants and is the 6th largest metropolitan area in Europe. Sweden[edit] Main article: List of urban areas in Sweden by population Urban areas in Sweden (tätorter) are statistically defined localities, totally independent of the administrative subdivision of the country. There are 1,956 such localities in Sweden, with a population ranging from 200 to 1,372,000 inhabitants.[30] United Kingdom[edit] Main article: List of urban areas in the United Kingdom In 2013 the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics (ONS) published 2011 Built-up Areas - Methodology and Guidance which sets out its definition of a built-up area as an area of built-up land of at least 20 hectares (0.077 sq mi), separated from other settlements by at least 200 metres (660 ft). For 2011 census data there are 5,493 built-up areas, of which 501 are divided into sub-divisions for which data is also available. Each built-up area is named algorithmically, using Ordnance Survey place-name data.[31] The ONS has produced census results from urban areas since 1951, since 1981 based upon the extent of irreversible urban development indicated on Ordnance Survey maps. The definition is an extent of at least 20 ha and at least 1,500 census residents. Separate areas are linked if less than 200 m (220 yd) apart. Included are transportation features.[32] The UK has five Urban Areas with a population over a million and a further sixty nine with a population over one hundred thousand. vte Largest urban areas of the United Kingdom(England and Wales: 2011 census built-up area;[33] Scotland: 2016 estimates settlement;[34] Northern Ireland: 2001 census urban area)[35] Rank Urban area Pop.

Unlike in Denmark and Sweden, the distance between each building has to be of less than 50 m, although exceptions are made due to parks, industrial areas, rivers, and similar. Groups of houses less than 400 m from the main body of an urban area are included in the urban area.[36] Poland[edit] In Poland, official ""urban"" population figures simply refer to those localities which have the status of towns (miasta). The ""rural"" population is that of all areas outside the boundaries of these towns. This distinction may give a misleading impression in some cases, since some localities with only village status may have acquired larger and denser populations than many many smaller towns.[37] On the other hand, the Upper Silesian Industrial Region covers 3,200 km and has approximately 3 million people. Russia[edit] Moscow, the capital and largest city of Russia, has a population estimated at 12.4 million residents within the city limits,[38] while over 17 million residents in the urban area,[39] and over 20 million residents in the Moscow Metropolitan Area.[40] It is among the world's largest cities, being the most populous city entirely within Europe, the most populous urban area in Europe,[39] the most populous metropolitan area in Europe,[40] and also the largest city by land area on the European continent.[41] Saint Petersburg, the cultural capital, is the second-largest city, with a population of roughly 5.4 million inhabitants.[42] Other major urban areas are Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, and Chelyabinsk. Moscow, the capital and largest city of Russia Saint Petersburg, the cultural capital and the second-largest city Yekaterinburg, the fourth-largest city in the country. Oceania[edit] Australia[edit] In Australia, urban areas are referred to as ""urban centres"" and are defined as population clusters of 1,000 or more people, with a density of at least 200/km2 (518/sq mi)[43] Australia is one of the most urbanised countries in the world, with more than 50% of the population residing in Australia's three biggest urban centres. Sydney is Australia's largest city, home to 5.3 million inhabitants.[44] New Zealand[edit] Main article: Urban areas of New Zealand Statistics New Zealand defines urban areas in New Zealand, which are independent of any administrative subdivisions and have no legal basis.[45] There are three classes of urban area: main urban areas are the 17 urban areas which have a population of 30,000 or more; secondary urban areas are the 14 urban areas which have a population of 10,000 or more but less than 30,000, and minor urban areas are the 103 urban areas which have a population of 1,000 or more but less than 10,000. Urban areas are reclassified after each New Zealand census, so population changes between censuses does not change an urban area's classification. North America[edit] Canada[edit] Main article: List of the 100 largest population centres in Canada According to Statistics Canada, an urban area in Canada is an area with a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per square kilometre (1,000/sq mi).[46] If two or more urban areas are within 2 km (1.2 mi) of each other by road, they are merged into a single urban area, provided they do not cross census metropolitan area or census agglomeration boundaries.[47] In the Canada 2011 Census, Statistics Canada redesignated urban areas with the new term ""population centre"";[48] the new term was chosen in order to better reflect the fact that urban vs. rural is not a strict division, but rather a continuum within which several distinct settlement patterns may exist. For example, a community may fit a strictly statistical definition of an urban area, but may not be commonly thought of as ""urban"" because it has a smaller population, or functions socially and economically as a suburb of another urban area rather than as a self-contained urban entity, or is geographically remote from other urban communities. Accordingly, the new definition set out three distinct types of population centres: small (population 1,000 to 29,999), medium (population 30,000 to 99,999) and large (population 100,000 or greater).[48] Despite the change in terminology, however, the demographic definition of a population centre remains unchanged from that of an urban area: a population of at least 1,000 people where the density is no fewer than 400 persons per km2. United States[edit] Main article: List of United States urban areas In the United States, there are two categories of urban area. The term urbanized area denotes an urban area of 50,000 or more people. Urban areas under 50,000 people are called urban clusters. Urbanized areas were first delineated in the United States in the 1950 census, while urban clusters were added in the 2000 census. There are 1,371 urban areas and urban clusters with more than 10,000 people. The U.S. Census Bureau defines an urban area as ""core census block groups or blocks that have a population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile (386 per square kilometer) and surrounding census blocks that have an overall density of at least 500 people per square mile (193 per square kilometer)"".[49] The largest urban area in the United States is the New York metropolitan area. The population of New York City, the core of the metropolitan area, exceeds 8.5 million people, its metropolitan statistical area has a population that is over 20 million, and its combined statistical area population is over 23 million. The next seven largest urban areas in the U.S. are Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Houston, and Atlanta.[50] About 82 percent of the population of the United States lives within the boundaries of an urbanized area as of December, 2010.[51] Combined, these areas occupy about 2 percent of the land area of the United States. Many Americans live in agglomerations of cities, suburbs, and towns that are adjacent to a metropolitan area's largest city.[citation needed] The skyscrapers of New York City, the most populous city in the United States and the most populous U.S. metropolitan area, are almost all situated in Manhattan, the world's largest central business district, seen here in this panorama in February 2018, as viewed from Weehawken, New Jersey.

For example, the city of Greenville, South Carolina has a city population just over 68,000 and an urbanized area population of around 400,000, while Greensboro, North Carolina has a city population just over 285,000 and an urbanized area population of around 300,000 — meaning that Greenville is actually ""larger"" for some intents and purposes, but not for others, such as taxation, local elections, etc. In the U.S. Department of Agriculture's natural resources inventory, urban areas are officially known as developed areas or urban and built-up areas. Such areas include cities, ethnic villages, other built-up areas of more than 10 ac (4 ha), industrial sites, railroad yards, cemeteries, airports, golf courses, shooting ranges, institutional and public administration sites, and similar areas. The 1997 national resources inventory placed over 98,000,000 ac (40,000,000 ha) in this category, an increase of 25,000,000 ac (10,000,000 ha) since 1982.[52] South America[edit] Argentina[edit] Argentina is highly urbanized.[53] The ten largest metropolitan areas account for half of the population, and fewer than one in ten live in rural areas. About 3 million people live in Buenos Aires City and the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area totals around 15 million, making it one of the largest urban areas in the world, with a population of 18 million all up.[54] Córdoba has around 1.5 million people living in the urban area, while Rosario, Mendoza and Tucumán have around 1.2 million inhabitants each[54] and La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe[54][55] have at least 500,000 people each. Brazil[edit] Main article: List of largest cities in Brazil According to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) urban areas already concentrate 84.35% of the population, while the Southeast region remains the most populated one, with over 80 million inhabitants.[56] The largest metropolitan areas in Brazil are São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte — all in the Southeastern Region — with 21, 12, and 5 million inhabitants respectively.[57] In general, state capitals are the largest cities in their states, except for Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, and Florianópolis, the capital of Santa Catarina. There are also non-capital metropolitan areas in the states of São Paulo (Campinas, Santos and the Paraíba Valley), Minas Gerais (Steel Valley), Rio Grande do Sul (Sinos Valley) and Santa Catarina (Itajaí Valley).[58] São Paulo, the largest city in Brazil, the largest city proper in the Southern Hemisphere, in the Americas, and the world's ninth-largest urban area by population.[59] vte Largest urban agglomerations in Brazil2017 Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics estimates[60][61][62] Rank Name State Pop.

111,"Khamica Bingham, Alumni | People of YU × Global Search search box search button Skip to main content Skip to local navigation Popular Links Programs of Study eClass Email Faculty & Staff Financial Services Libraries Directory Search People of YU Submit a feature Apply Contact Khamica Bingham, Alumni Posted on 3 August 2021 Khamica Bingham, Alumni Posted on 3 August 2021 York: What is a defining moment in your life that has shaped your path?Khamica: A defining moment that has really shaped my path was four months ago, when my mom passed away. She was just the person that really helped to inspire, impact my journey on and off the track. I will remember her words forever. She really helped me to refine my purpose, and in times when I felt like giving up, in times when I was dealing with a lot of injuries, and times when I doubted myself. My mom was the one that was able to pick me up, and just remind me that she believed in me. Losing her was hard, but it has given me a different type of motivation and drive to live on her legacy. York: What made you fall in love with the sport of track? Khamica: I fell in love with the sport of track because it was something that just came so naturally to me. Running was just something that I knew that I was good at, it was instinctive. And I just love that when I run and I’m trying to push my body beyond its limits to go faster and faster, it's like a break from reality. I just love the intenseness of it. I love the competitiveness of it. I love having the ability to travel and represent my country. I love that I can push my body to its limits, and just keep raising the bar and challenging myself to see how much faster, how much better can I get. York: Is there anything you've learned from sport that you apply to other parts of your life? Khamica: I’ve learned a lot about self-identity. And I think that really applies to life because while you're chasing a dream, you're chasing a goal. And while you're on that journey, you're going to fail many times. With the myths of failing and injuries and setbacks and obstacles, even with this sport, it has taught me that yes, I can fail, but it doesn't mean that Khamica the person is a failure. Khamica Bingham. Source York University Athletics York: How has York shaped your path from both an athletic and academic sense? Khamica: York grew on me. I didn't expect to have the type of experience that I did, especially being a part of a varsity track team. I didn't expect that I would really enjoy the years that I got to run for York. Track and Field is such an individual sport. I run 100 meters, so it's just me on the line most of the time. But to be at the CIS, which I think is called USport now, and the OUA championships, and to be along the side of the team and cheering for everybody, it felt bigger than just yourself. You were so happy to see other people accomplishing their goals, and improving their performances. So it was just really nice to be a part of that team. Academically, I didn't have the same type of experience as many other students, because I was traveling so much, but during my last few years at York, my teachers were so accommodating. They allowed me to do distance learning, which meant I could pursue sport 100% and be traveling and as busy as I was, and they still do well academically. York: Is there a memory from your time at York that stands out? Khamica: In 2014, it was my first year with the Varsity Lions team. And a really impactful moment for me was watching the men's track and field team win their title. Being part of that team, and witnessing all the athletes that worked so hard, the coaching staff, I was so happy for them. Another personal memory for me was when I got to speak on behalf of former York President Mamdouh Shoukri at his farewell event. He did a lot in terms of his involvement with sports, and he was so involved and active in the athletic department and in our lives. I was honoured to be chosen person to speak on behalf of the President. York: You are passionate about social justice and activism. Can you talk about why that's important to you and the ways you’re creating positive change? Khamica: Last summer I co-founded Meet My Melanin because we wanted to create a safe space and a platform where people can feel seen, heard, and known in all spaces. I’ve personally experienced racism within my sport. I’ve just had so many experiences that I felt like with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, this was the time where the world was paying attention. I realized that I have a voice, and experience, and I want to be able to share that, so that the younger generation can be impacted completely different and so that they don't have to go through these same obstacles. We go into local schools and speak to students and teachers to improve that environment so that students feel included and understand diversity. As they transition into university or the workforce, they feel seen and understood. It’s been an amazing journey. I just love that we can educate, inspire and impact.

Ranging from established engineers, consultants, and academics to young professionals and university students. Through LinkedIn, you can contact fellow YES-DC members directly by becoming a member of the LinkedIn group. Some of our alumni are also still within this group so there is also a direct connection with middle management and seniors within the energy field. As well, many of our former members are employed abroad and bring valuable insight, knowledge and connections about the industry in their representative countries. Follow on LinkedIn YES-DC aims to also add value to its foreign members through the local dutch community, the monthly newsletter or by sharing vacancies beyond and within the Dutch borders. Although foreign members are seldom present during activities, we keep the connection active through LinkedIn and our members’ database connections. Do you have a vacancy to share? Contact Us YESDC PARTNERS NJRYES-DC is a member of the Nederlandse Jeugd Raad (NJR) (in English: Dutch National Youth Council).

In 2015, this conference (COP21) resulted in the historical Paris Agreement. The implementation of the Paris Agreement is the primary concern of the UNFCCC and the Conferences to follow in the future.YES-DC is an official Observer at the UNFCCC Conferences, and has had this status since the year 2000. This Observer role gives an organisation the responsibility to observe the negotiations, and to secure that the interests of the group they represent are taken into consideration. YES-DC has a status as Youth organisation, which implies securing the interests of youth in the climate negotiations.Each year, YES-DC sends a delegation of members to COP. Activities from the delegation include attending negotiation meetings, sharing experiences with youth organisations from other countries, and providing workshops on topics that are familiar with YES-DC.

115,"About Us NW Skip to content Home Events Network News About us Become a Member Menu Home Events Network News About us Become a Member About Us ABOUT YES-DC Young Energy Specialists and Development Co-operation (YES-DC) is an association of students and young professionals interested and/or working in the field of energy and development co-operation. YES-DC was found in October 1994, as a means to create a network and to facilitate the exchange of information and experiences. Since March 1996, YES-DC has officially been established as an association. YES-DC HISTORY On 15th October 1994, over twenty-five enthusiastic young professionals came together to discuss the future of energy. In the 1990’s, before the internet and social media, the need arose for a discussion platform to share knowledge and ideas. On 28th January 28 1995, a second meeting was organised, and Young Energy Specialists and Development Co-operation (YES-DC) was officially founded. Since the beginning, the focus has been on both the Dutch energy system, and energy systems in developing countries. In the mid 2000’s, as the general thought was that the Dutch energy system was ‘finished’, the focus was increasingly laid on how we could help developing countries in their future energy needs.However, as the impact of climate change was becoming more visible, the focus shifted back towards the Dutch energy system. How can we work towards a sustainable energy system, running on renewable energy sources? Many, many aspects of this complex issue have been discussed over the last years.Throughout its history, YES-DC has been organising sessions to deepen our understanding of the challenges we face, and the solutions that are out there. The focus has mostly been a technical one, although also more ‘soft aspects’ around implementation have been discussed over the last years. YES-DC still organises several sessions every year. YES-DC MISSION ENGAGING YOUNG PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY, AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH KNOWLEDGE SHARING, NETWORKING AND COMMUNITY BUILDING. YES-DC MEMBERS The members of YES-DC are young professionals and students in the field of energy and/or sustainability. They work within local and international companies, government bodies, universities, research institutions, and NGOs. The board of YES-DC are honorary members, which besides their professional occupations takes care of the organisational and financial framework, and organises these knowledge-sharing and networking opportunities, considering the valuable input from its members along the way. The YES-DC Alumni are former board members, which gather once a year and are still part of the organization’s community. YES-DC Board Ligin Thomas President/Chairman “You think energy is a secondary problem. But think about it: almost all of today’s most basic problems like hunger and poverty are tied to energy. So you solve the problem of energy; you solve half of the world’s problems.”This particular quote from my professor Dr P.V Bhale during my bachelors was the spark to my desire to become energy professional. I have been acquainted with the complexity of solving the energy problem ever since I started my career in the oil and gas industry, several projects on offshore wind turbines and my latest work going on in the hydrogen transport infrastructure.My goal as a chairman/president of YES-DC is to work along with the board of 2021-2022 to strengthen our network, expand its reach and enable our members to reach their full potential in contributing to the energy transition. Linkedin Mrinal Abhinav Treasurer I believe that energy is the key contribution to financial development and there is a nearby connection between the accessibility of energy and the development of a country. YES-DC is the perfect platform to bridge that gap and share knowledge from different people on exciting topics. It would be a great opportunity for me to understand the prospect of the energy industry better and gain a well-rounded insight by networking with people. Linkedin Rene van der Velden Secretary To effectively and fairly shape the energy transition, young energy professionals need to keep learning from each other by sharing experiences and perspectives. I’m happy to be actively involved in stimulating the dialogue between the professionals currently tackling this challenge. With a background in international development, I see the differences and similarities of the energy transition in the global south and north. At YES-DC, I hope to link up these different perspectives so they will benefit from each other. I’m excited to organise effective events where people meet, grow their network, and learn.​ Linkedin Jier Nzuanzu Content Manager With the experience of studying and creating algorithms, I think I can do more than do my everyday job. Therefore, I choose to act actively, hoping that others in my field realise that we can do more. I am grateful to be a new board member, and I hope to learn and broaden my perspective about sustainability.In my term, I will focus my attention on the internal relations and the digital presence of YES-DC. With my help, I hope, together with the rest of the board, to create meaningful connections and engaging events.​ Linkedin Iva Tsvetkova Community Manager Being an active member in a few energy-related networks made me join YES-DC as a board member this year. After receiving so much in the form of valuable knowledge, connections and experience – it was my turn to give back to our community now. That’s why my focus is on growing and sustaining a diverse and collaborative community of energy professionals and students who aspire to follow their steps. Through my educational background, I gained knowledge on the energy transition from a business perspective. More particularly, on energy innovations and strategic solutions. I am looking forward to making our lectures/events known and accessible for a larger audience while cultivating the existing network in the upcoming year. These new uncertain times are calling for a change in how we do things and connect, so let’s build the platform’s future together! Linkedin Jose Carrasco Montejano External Relations While the technical knowledge required to face the climate crisis is readily available, we-as humanity- are failing to take bold actions to tackle the main challenge of our time. A shared problem requires shared efforts and a wide understanding of the problem we are facing. As the person within YES DC in charge of the relationship with external organizations, I will enable our members to access all the knowledge and networking options provided by our partner organizations on a global scale. ​ Linkedin Jan Jouke Melchers Events Manager Being a YES-DC member already brought me a lot of great contacts and insights into what the global energy transition is about. With joining the board I hope that the community can inspire even more young specialists to connect and seek the interfaces where each of our individual contributions to the energy puzzle overlap. I am convinced that the energy puzzle is only solved when we explore on an individual level but cooperate on a societal level. With the diversity of YES-DC and its related network/partners we have a major role in this and I am proud to be part of the team that can set the path forward for the upcoming year.​ Linkedin Young Energy Specialists and Development Co-operation (YES-DC) is an association of students and young professionals interested and/or working in the field of energy and international co-operation.

Epub 2011 Aug 6. Authors K Grigorakis 1 , G Rigos Affiliation 1 Laboratory of Fish Nutrition and Pathology, Institute of Aquaculture, Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR), Aghios Kosmas 16777, Athens, Greece. PMID: 21821276 DOI: 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.07.015 Abstract Aquatic farming has been considered, during the last decades, as the fastest growing food production industry powered by governmental and technological impulsion. Compensation for fisheries decline, creation of new jobs and source of financial windfall are the most important benefits. However, similar to most of the human food-production activities, aquaculture raised several issues related to the environmental welfare and consumer safety. An effort to record the aquaculture-environment and -human safety interactions with regard to the Mediterranean mariculture, is attempted herein. We focused on this geographical area due to its individualities in both the hydrological and physicochemical characteristics and the forms of aquaculture activities. The cage farming of euryhaline marine fish species and more recently of bluefin tuna and mollusk farming are the dominating aquaculture activities. The impacts of these activities to the environment, through wastes offloads, introduction of alien species, genetic interactions, disease transfer, release of chemicals, use of wild recourses, alterations of coastal habitats and disturbance of wildlife, are analytically considered. Also the consumer safety issues related to the farming are assessed, including generation of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, contaminants transferred to humans though food chain and other hazards from consumption of aquacultured items. Within these, the major literature findings are critically examined and suggestions for scientific areas that need further development are made. The major tasks for future aquaculture development in this region are: (i) to ensure sustainability and (ii) to balance the risks to public or environmental health with the substantial economical benefits. In regard with monitoring, tools must be created or adapted to predict the environmental costs and estimate consumer impact. At a canonistic and legal basis, the establishment of appropriate legal guidelines and common policies from all countries involved should be mandatory. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
