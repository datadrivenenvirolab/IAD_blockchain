The focus is on maintaining the tenuous harmony between the 5 ja’s that bind the planet — jan (people), jal (water) jameen (land), jungle (forests) and janwar (fauna). With projects in districts of Uttaranchal and Madhya Pradesh, the Academy consists of professionals who have come together from diverse fields. Some are geologists and geophysicists. Others are vernacular architects, water managers, explorers, trek escorts, camp organisers. Yet others are botanists, species enumerators and even young farmers who seek to put their experience to good use. The Academy has chosen to carry out a major part of its work in the mountains since these remain the only repositories of culture and biodiversity that have not yet been ravaged by development. The main thrust of the Academy’s work is in three broad regions. In Garhwal where we are involved in: \\x95 Building quake-proof homes with local traditions and skills. \\x95 Spring water bottling in the higher reaches of the Himalayas with least environment impact.. \\x95 Dissemination of information on and the promotion of growth of medicinal plants and herbs. \\x95 Mushroom farming with women cooperatives. In Coorg where we have undertaken: \\x95 The afforestation of the Kopatti Valley. \\x95 The creation of a Red List Park. \\x95 The setting up of a Rice farm to showcase various biodiverse species of rice. \\x95 Farm Awareness Programmes.
