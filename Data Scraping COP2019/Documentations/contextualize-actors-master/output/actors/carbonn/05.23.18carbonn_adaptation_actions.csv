About 85% of the territory of the water recharge area of the water supply sub-basins is covered by highlands and native forest, ecosystems of high ecological importance for the regulation of water flows, acts like a sponge that releases it slowly to the throughout the year.
Highlands have little resilience and low capacity of adaptation in front of the negative anthropic impacts that affect them, for this reason they are considered like ecosystems highly vulnerable.
The objective of the IWMPWP is to protect water sources for human consumption for Cuenca city, we will get this with an integrative and sustainable negotiation process with the watershed actors.
The IWMPWP works in the supply areas that supply the water systems that EPAPE EP manages directly and in those that are administered by local organizations. The former correspond to the contribution areas for the city of Cuenca and the latter to the rural sector, in a Management and Co-management process, respectively.
In the water supply areas for the city of Cuenca the IWMPWP executes a management process by which it leads the formulation and implementation of actions tending to guarantee the vital liquid. In the areas of contribution to the rural sector, a co-management process is carried out, which attempts to link the parish GADs and organizations that administer water systems to the process of protecting their water sources.
- Mutual agreements for water - MAW: These are voluntary agreements with landowners in the areas of water recharge in order to conserve the native forest and highlands, to recover the riparian vegetation (biological filters), to implement environmentally friendly agricultural practices; in return, ETAPA EP supports with incentives for good production and livestock practices in sites with aptitude.
In order to guarantee the environmental services of highlands and native forest and to safeguard its long-term conservation status, the following strategies are implemented:
a) Purchase of properties with high water yield, located in headwaters of watersheds with an investment amount of USD $ 1,337,400.00 and a total of 14,879 hectares for conservation.
b) Support for joining the Socio Bosque program, in coordination with the Ministry of the Environment of Ecuador

This multidimensional project works as a local economic development, social cohesion and urban resilience strategy that integrates agriculture, livestock production, solidarity harvest exchange, food processing, surplus marketing and local environmental management, contributing to food security and sovereignty, urban agro-ecology and nutrition. The project has technified its intervention through productive infrastructure, as low-cost micro-greenhouses, water harvesting and drip irrigation specially designed for small production units. 
AGRUPAR seeks to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable population of the District, working with women (85,71% of participants) and female headed households, the elderly, children and youth, people with special needs or disabilities, refugees, migrants, unemployed people, shelters, health centers, schools, associations, addiction and social rehabilitation centers, and anyone who wants to be part of this innovative approach to food self-sufficiency. 
The project seeks to strengthen the technical capacities of urban and peri-urban farmers and the formation of human capital, along with increasing sustainable and safe agricultural production and agribusiness, focusing on microenterprise management with access to different markets. AGRUPAR improves participants’ earnings by generating jobs, as well as helping them to save money by consuming their own production. The program has being a ""seedbed"" of agricultural micro-business of all kinds, such as production of organic vegetables, fruits, crops, medicinal and ornamental plants, animal husbandry, beekeeping and food processing (flour, bread, preserved or dehydrated food, snacks, dairy products and meats)
Urban agriculture is practiced in public and private vacant land, gardens, balconies, terraces, pots or containers, using recycled materials such as plastic bottles and tubes, tires, pallets and glass. There are 352,600 beneficiaries of the program (56,000 urban farmers with their families and 170,000 responsible consumers). AGRUPAR has trained 16,700 participants, opened 2,500 urban gardens and promoted 110 urban agriculture startups with 105 different food products; investing US$ per year.
Moreover, since 2006 the program has lauched 14 bio markets called ""bioferias"", special spaces located at strategic locations of the District for the weekly sale of products by urban farmers who are part of AGRUPAR. The bioferias have become an educational space of permanent offering of healthy, safe and qualified food (fresh surplus from garden production), fostering a direct relationship between producers and consumers, within a framework of fair price and weight and a welcoming atmosphere, providing a solidarity economy.
The organic food supply of urban agriculture increases Quito’s self-sufficiency rate, reducing carbon emissions. Its practice is an adaptation response to climate change and a way to build a more resilient District, by increasing biodiversity, recovering degraded ecosystems, promoting rational use of resources, water efficiency and revaluation of urban land for food production, as well as generating citizen participation and solidarity within local economic development.

It will allow the energy transition and new modes of consumption to be heralded in.
The SO Grid project will allow for real time control of electrical consumption by the consumer and boost quality of services. This represents a first stage in anticipation and accompaniment of new ways of using electricity, especially with the arrival of decentralised renewable energies, and anticipating peaks in consumption due to the use of electric vehicles.
In terms of the quality of service provided, this major improvement will allow for real time control and the possibility of acting remotely and more rapidly in the event of a failure and ensure at all times the match between production and consumption, especially when the latter peaks.
A smart neighbourhood is a modern neighbourhood, with easier living, greater co-operation and less expense. The city wagers on the highest performance technologies and large scale open data to make citizens' lives easier and make public intervention more effective.
This project includes a strong territorial dimension, the “SO” of “SO Grid” clearly denoting the South West (Sud-Ouest) of France. 
Toulouse is a land of innovations (with a large number of researchers and students and three competitiveness clusters) right at the heart of the first French region in research and development expenditure. 
The SO Grid project came in response to the call for expression of interest launched by ADEME (the French Agency for the Environment and Energy Management) on intelligent electrical networks. 
The development of smart grids, which is in the test phase in the Empalot neighbourhood, has also been necessitated by the arrival of decentralised renewable energy sources over the network (wind power, photovoltaic, positive energy buildings, etc.) and new needs with 2 million electric vehicles by 2020. 
This experience fits in with a global approach aiming to develop smart grids, and especially a complete communication chain over all the electricity distribution networks based on PLC (Power Line Communication).
The SOGRID project involves building the global communication chain that will enable all items of equipment placed on the low and medium voltage networks to communicate directly via the electrical network. In concrete terms, the consortium bringing together ten partners around ERDF (the French electricity grid) and STMicroelectronics will develop a new generation electronic chip, equipment that will take that chip on board and the software to run the show.

516,Biodiversity – Grand Parc Garonne - Toulouse Metropolis,"Toulouse Metropolis, France",France,"In Toulouse, the banks of the Garonne shelter an area of natural habitat right in the middle of the city that the Grand Parc Garonne project seeks to promote. Having noted that the Garonne and its banks, cornerstones to the local natural heritage, constitute a powerful lever to improve the quality of life and renew human contact with nature, Toulouse Métropole has devised a programme to make the most of this great asset aiming to create a Grand Parc Garonne to give a breath of fresh air to the entire Toulouse Metropolis.
The Grand Parc Garonne constitutes one of the major spaces for CO2 capture for the agglomeration and marks a moment of reconnection between the inhabitants and nature.
The Grand Parc will re-invest the banks of the Garonne and by 2020 it will connect up the whole 25 mile length stretching from the north to the south of the Metropolis. The Grand Parc concerns seven Toulouse Métropole towns over 3,000 hectares, thus giving the metropolis its “green lung”. This project seeks to develop soft modes of transport thanks to pedestrian and cycle paths and promote the natural heritage, fostering use of the waters, boating and nautical sports while also developing new spaces for cultural activities and conviviality.
To do this, itineraries, between 1 ½ and 6 miles long, allow hikers, cyclists and persons with reduced mobility, to discover the flora, the aquatic fauna, the Garonne area and the violet thanks to the many information boards at key points on the route. They also afford an opportunity to discover the neighbourhood, its history, its natural heritage and agriculture. Picnic areas and benches lie alongside the path so people can take a rest and make the most of the landscape, the fauna and the flora. 
Five other routes for pedestrians and cyclists will be created by 2017 on the Quinze Sols market gardening area.
100 years after the creation of the “Parc Toulousain”, the île du Ramier is again to become a place of greenery open to all, a huge area for relaxation and leisure activities, with games equipment, new sports activities, walks and educational gardens.

The Garonne drains a watershed covering about 10,000 km² which has the notable feature of being a steeply sloped corolla shaped basin. It thus tends to cause the concentration of already substantial flows of water coming from the direct or indirect tributaries of the Garonne, which takes its source in the Pyrenees.
The speeds at which the waters rise in the event of episodes of major flooding are of around 20 to 50 cm per hour. The time slot for prediction is short. 
The Garonne's history has been well chronicled so we can trace back to the biggest floods and better understand its behaviour.
The Garonne flood zone represents 15% of Toulouse's territory.
As it flows through the Metropolis, the river banks show many works conducted over the centuries. Quaysides and dykes now border the river.
In the present day, the dykes are real urban protection works against flooding, sized for the highest waters known, with this being a regular feature about every ten years. Other works like the channelling and deepening of the flood stage of the Garonne downstream of Bazacle, urbanisation and embankments in the flood plain and recalibration and control over the meanders on the contained River Hers and its tributaries.
The Toulouse agglomeration is identified as an area with high risk of flooding (Territoire à Risque Important d'Inondation or TRI). The aim of the flood prevention plan and the safeguard plan is to foresee and reduce negative consequences for human health, the environment, the natural heritage and economic activity associated with flooding in the Community.
In the event of a major natural or technological disaster, the population is warned by a siren as well as information provided by the municipal police. In order to ensure the dissemination of information and instructions in the event of an alert, agreements have been signed with various radio and TV media. In addition, the Metropolis has got equipped with a mass auto dialler to send out telephone messages, SMS, faxes and e-mails intended to inform citizens as quickly as possible of a major event to come or in process and the instructions to follow to stay safe. Inhabitants registered in the telephone directory are automatically brought into this provision.
An intervention plan has also been set up at the administrative level to ensure the creation of a team to protect people and property.
According to the levels of alert, this will generate the closure of watertight gates and installation of barriers, close sluice gates on the storm water drains and start up pumps. Closing off storm water allows the Garonne to be prevented from overflowing.",,Completed,Policy/Strategies/Action Plans

To attain this objective, Terr’eau ciel arranges spaces for landscaping and offers events, conferences and training for all sections of the public targeting those who wish to get started or develop their knowledge of cultivation in an urban environment.
By re-investing urban spaces to develop vegetable garden landscaping, there is a real opportunity to renew the link between people and our common mother Earth.
The association was identified by the MACIF Foundation during the ""Talents Midi-Pyrénées"" competition for its initiatives in favour of good food and health.
It acts to reduce the costs of maintaining green areas and reducing waste via the creation of composting points, conducts training and opens the way to green professional skills. Beside the beauty of the garden replacing previously unoccupied space, the inhabitants can also make savings on their food bills and also cut out travel to the local supermarket. This initiative brings inhabitants together within a virtuous synergy of good practices both for eating habits and respect for the environment and education. 
The goal with these gardens is to use gardening themes to give a clearer idea of how the plant world works and raise awareness as to issues around biodiversity, responsible food, valorisation of the circular economy and short supply circuits, water and waste management.
Good waste management also means council taxes can be reduced.
The structure creates the urban food landscape then accompanies the inhabitants over the 2 years the project lasts.
Terr'eau ciel works in collaboration with social insertion structures specialised in biodiversity refuges, the recuperation and re-use of building materials and the promotion of re-used timber or wood. 
In 2015, the association benefited from support from the MACIF Foundation and the Fondation de France.
Perspectives for 2016 include the management and animation of green productive areas on developed pilot sites, the creation of a cooperative, first assessment of the incredible edibles and the actions pursued.

Rajkot lies within the watershed expansion of Aji river basin and it is a network of 19 natural drainage courses, locally known as vokdas. Unfortunately, these vokdas are being used for sewage and solid waste disposal which has led to environmental degradation of the same. Water supply depends in the first months after the monsoon to a certain degree on local water supply sources. 90% of total water supply of city is depending on Narmada water, which is sourced from 700 km away from the city and consumes huge electricity. Soil stratum in Rajkot region consists of hard rock. Moreover, the confined aquifer layer is thin. Hence, the availability of ground water for potable use in Rajkot is limited. Catchment area management and measures for aquifer recharge are potential solutions to this problem. The study thus seeks to identify the potential for augmenting the availability of local water resources.  Based on the allowable water abstraction, the city’s reliance on Narmada water may also reduce. Local aquifer recharge and an improvement in the ground water situation are desired outcomes.

EPCert not just only stimulating green development in Melaka, but also promoting green economy to achieve the Green City Action Plan (GCAP) target. This initiative scheme was conducted through identifying the buildings energy performance and additionally will propose a rating and labelling individual buildings. Plus, the evaluation process will also include the users’ satisfaction level and their building’s functionality.
Established in October 2016, the EPCert scheme targets on non-residential buildings and will be inflate to residential buildings in future. The pilot scheme operated on a voluntary basis and will be widely used by the local government buildings in Melaka. This scheme evaluates three basic principles such as Building Energy Index (BEI), building’s characteristics and organisation’s commitments. This will rates building energy efficiency by practising grades from seven flowers icon to one flowers icon that also known as 7-Flowers rated (‘seven flowers icon’ is the most efficient grade). In present, the certification validity period is only valid for three years and will be required to disclose during the buying or the rental process to give information (building energy performance data) to the prospective buyers or tenants.
Viewing the fact that lots of building users were not consuming energy efficiently, EPCert has planned to make sure that they will review their energy consumption and offering the top managements or building owners in every organization on the monitoring process regarding buildings energy performance. It also offers a mechanism towards prospective buyers and tenants by comparing the energy efficiency of different buildings or the energy rating across a range of similar buildings. To date, there are nine major government buildings in Melaka that had joined this programme; (i) Seri Negeri, (ii) Graha Makmur, (iii) Wisma Negeri, (iv) Putra Specialist Hospital, (v) Graha Maju, (vi) Melaka International Trade Centre (MITC), (vii) Majlis Perbandaran Alor Gajah, (viii) Melaka Sentral and (ix) Wisma Air. They had been audited from November 2016 until May 2017. Auditing process was conducted by EPCert Secretariat Member by obeying the EPCert Manual (non-residential buildings) 2016.
EPCert emphasized that building’s energy performance is not only relied on the energy efficient appliances or technology in building, but it must have a profound commitment from the building owners and users by practising the energy saving behaviour and environmental awareness.

To resolve these issues, Kuala Lumpur City Hall (KLCH) has plans to initiate programmes with relevant agencies such as the Land Transport Authority (SPAD) that would improve the public transportation system and increase the transportation sustainability of Klang Valley. The Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2020, in particular, intends to respond to the unprecedented growth and changes of Kuala Lumpur’s urban transportation landscape.Recent efforts on urban 
transportation design addresses both the functional and aesthetic aspects of the city’s built environment. 
The Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2020 particularly cites good transportation linkage as an essential factor to the 
success of the city, noting that public transportation would enable greater flexibility and movement. For the 
residents of Kuala Lumpur, it is important to provide transportation structure that allows members of the 
community equal accessibility. The KLCH recognizes low modal split of the transportation sector 
as the key problem to high demands on road infrastructure and traffic congestion. Thereby, based on the Land Transport 
Authority's Masterplan, the public transport modal share needs to be increased to 40%.",,Planning phase,Action plan

Mistra Urban Futures (MUF) is an international centre supporting sustainable urban futures by driving the co-production of knowledge. Recognising that local expertise is required to address city level challenges, the centre operates in four cities in the world including Gothenburg, Cape Town, Kisumu, and Manchester. The MUF-KTP is Cape Town’s flagship project within the Mistra Urban Futures programme. 
As part of the MUF-KTP, four academic researchers working on policy areas that complement MUF’s focus areas, are embedded in the City of Cape Town, in relevant departments, working towards these urban sustainability objectives. The policy areas that the researchers are working on include: Green Economy; Climate Change; Space Economy; and Energy Governance. The researchers are simultaneously supporting policy development by contributing context relevant knowledge, developing strategic partnerships with stakeholders both within and outside local government, and documenting the process of policy development, making urban development policy and decision making processes more legible. The research being conducted at the City is central to PhDs being conducted by each of the researchers.
The second major component of the Knowledge Transfer Project is the City Officials exchange programme. This component provides the opportunity for high performing City staff to be provided with structured academic engagement to build their capacity, engage with international peers and profile the City’s work in internationally recognized journals.

The coastline, however, also represents a source of risk to the City where dynamic coastal processes interact with social constructs such as property and infrastructure. Coastal risk within Cape Town is being compounded by the fact that many departments and tiers of government-each with their own roles and responsibilities-interact within the coastal environment. Decisions pertaining to coastal management have generally been reactive and ad-hoc, without consideration of future climate change risks such as sea-level rise or increased storm surge events. The delineation and implementation of a coastal setback line by the City represents a proactive and risk-averse approach to coastal decision making. This spatial planning mechanism is unique to Cape Town, where the legacy of Apartheid-era spatial planning remains prevalent. As such, the City has recognised the need for a setback line that incorporates both biophysical and, perhaps most importantly, socio-economic dimensions within its design. It is important to note that coastal setback lines are not effective as a tool to manage risk retrospectively, but rather they should be used to manage and prevent inappropriate development in the coastal zone into the future.",2009,Completed,Policy/Strategies/Action Plans

1114,Climate Change Adaptation Plan for the City - City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality,"City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, South Africa",South Africa,"""The third step was to assess potential adaptation mechanisms that could be implemented to reduce the impacts. The idea was to develop a comprehensive Climate Change Adaption Plan which explored indicators on how climate change may affect sustainable development within the City.The Adaptation Plan builds upon a completed risk & vulnerability assessment and provides an understanding of challenges and opportunities facing sectors in increasing adaptive capacity.It Identified priorities for medium and long-term research within and across sectors within the provincial economy.Climatic model projections were done for CoJ and indicate that the local climate is likely to become both significantly hotter and more humid in future.The models indicate significant increases in temperatures over the next four to five decades, with this trend continuing into the subsequent century. The warming trend will have a significant impact on average seasonal temperatures. The average of the seven climate model projections indicates an annualised temperature increase in the order of 2.4°C by the “near future” and 4.5°C further into the future.  Largest increases are expected to occur in spring: an increase of 5°C and 5.2°C in average maximum day-time minimum night-time temperatures respectively by 2081-2100.There is also a substantial risk that the CoJ will experience an increase in annual rainfall which is characterised by a higher frequency of storm events and a longer rainy season. This would potentially be accompanied by a lengthening of the rainy season, particularly into early autumn and potentially starting earlier in spring as well, and an increase in both the frequency and intensity of rainfall. The averaged precipitation projections for the seven climate models shows an 18% increase in annual rainfall by mid-century, with a slightly larger increase of 27% projected for the period 2081-2100. These percentages are not intended to be presented as firm predictions of future rainfall.",2008,,Policy/Strategies/Action Plans
1115,Climate change Risk & Vulnerability Assessment for the City of Johannesburg - City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality,"City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, South Africa",South Africa,"The City of Johannesburg has conducted a Climate Change Risk & Vulnerability Assessment in 2008 as a first step of identifying key vulnerable sectors and determining how significant the impacts of climate change will be on sector specific vulnerabilities in order to properly plan for adaptation. The analysis included, with respect to each planning area, an evaluation of the adaptive capacity, the ability to accommodate changes in climate with minimum disruption or minimum additional cost. This step concluded with an assessment of vulnerability, which combines the sensitivity and adaptability findings. Areas that are sensitive to climate change but less able to adapt were considered vulnerable.The purpose of commissioning of an assessment of Johannesburg’s vulnerability to climate change was to understand the current knowledge of global climate change, and localise this understanding; To assess the key vulnerable areas within the city, how they will be affected, and how the projected impacts can be mitigated; To Provide options for future opportunities to improve the perceptions around climate change and 
explore future avenues of chage.The scaled down rainfall and temperature extremes for Johannesburg was used to understand the current climate and thus the change that is likely to take place in the next 40 to 60 years’ time, and longer. Due to the uncertainties associated with modelling climate, a number of models were used to 
obtain a range of results. No one model is deemed more correct than the other as they are merely representations of the natural environment. A storyline of “business as usual” was adapted in order to obtain scenarios of future population growth, emissions and economy growth. The models differ with respect to the magnitude of change, however, there is a general consensus amongst them that Johannesburg will experience increase in minimum and maximum temperatures throughout the year. In addition, rainfall will also increase. What is not known of the increase in rainfall is whether it will be as a result of an increase in intense short duration rain (leading to 
dangerous situations such as flash floods) or an increase in the number of rainfall events. The models are also unable at present to project any extreme weather occurrences such as droughts or floods. Nevertheless, significant action can be implemented on the basis of the current results in key sectors.",2008,Completed,Assessment/Research
1116,Enhancement of Early Warning Systems - City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality,"City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, South Africa",South Africa,"A key issue highlighted in this study is that much of the CoJ’s climate change-related vulnerability stems from the fact that several of the systems considered most likely to be impacted upon by climate change are already severely stressed under existing climatic conditions. This is particularly true for the CoJ’s stormwater infrastructure – of the ten Action Level A rated risks; four are related directly to the threat of an increase in urban flooding. It is the existing strain on the stormwater infrastructure that potentially gives rise to the greatest cause for concern. A wide range of adaptations have been developed for each of the Action Level A-rated risks and with consideration to the specific needs, constraints and requirements of the CoJ. Of critical importance in the short-term is the development of an Early-Warning System that will be used to prevent loss of life and property during extreme flooding events. Whereas there is no empirical evidence to determine a direct relationship between heat waves and loss of life in the COJ, this area however is of critical importance given the projected increase in maximum temperatures. It is important for the COJ to develop a heat wave response plan. In addition to these risk specific adaptations, a number of strategic-level adaptations have also been identified which have the potential to address a broad number of risks across multiple sectors.",2000,In operation,Technical/Infrastructure investment

change, cost of energy, customers moving off the grid etc. In some more detail:
• Renewable Energy, Energy efficiency, Demand side management and storage technologies (decreasing
traditional kWh sales from utility)
• Customers are getting smarter (behind the meter initiatives) such as smart mini-grids, storage and
embedded generation enabling disconnection from the grid
• Financial changes such as reduced technology costs and reduced financing costs (more affluent customers
can choose alternatives due to financial considerations eg rooftop solar PV)
• Enabling policy such as Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency policies and subsidies (external influences
impacting on kWh business of municipality)
• Tax incentives such as the Section 12B, K and L for efficiencies and renewables
• Many of these are currently not yet reducing the required network capacity
• This has and will result in many non-utility players entering the market creating new competition and a risk of
stranded assets for utilities
• The distributed generation and renewable energy will introduce variability into the network where a safe, reliable
and clean supply of electricity is a key pre-condition for sustainability and economic prosperity
Some of the challenges with municipalities becoming generators include:
• The definition of an IPP in the new NGR and MSA effectively means that local government cannot hold a
direct or indirect controlling interest in an IPP
• In addition currently municipalities do not have the ‘competency’ as a generator of electricity
• The reduction in energy tariff and the need to assess tariff structures based on leased lines and networks
• Safety concerns from embedded generation
• Current poorly formulated policy to deal with embedded generation
• All, if not most of these items need to be addressed in order for municipality’s to embrace opportunities and
minimise potential threats posed

If planning and investment is done appropriately, KwaDukuza could ultimately attain a city environment that is highly competitive, functional and liveable, which in turn will attract key skills to the region. 
In attracting more capital, in all its facets such as people and business to the region, the city would be able to enhance its revenue base to deliver better services to its citizens on a continuing basis. If its growth and development is left unchecked, however, it could become unsustainable for the region.
The KwaDukuza Municipality City Development Strategy process will serve to identify the key opportunities and challenges that underpin KwaDukuza’s performance, and develop key strategies up to the 2030 horizon to enhance and mitigate these findings and ultimately promote positive, transformational change. It should be acknowledged that the KwaDukuza Municipality City Development Strategy will align to the “INTEGRATING CLIMATE CHANGE INTO CITY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES (CDS) - CLIMATE CHANGE AND STRATEGIC PLANNING” as published by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) - HS Number: HS/075/15E",,In operation,Policy/Strategies/Action Plans
1134,Estuary Management Plan - KwaDukuza Local Municipality,"KwaDukuza Local Municipality, South Africa",South Africa,"The eight estuaries which fall within the Kwadukuza Municipality boundaries are categorised as intermittently open estuaries with the exception of the uMvoti estuary which is classified as a river mouth (Table 4.1).  Only one estuary with the municipality (uThongathi estuary) has had its present ecological status and preliminary ecological reserve determined formally using the methods described by the National Water Act of 1998.  This is unfortunate as this process would clarify a great deal about the water quantity and quality issues facing these systems as well as provide a sound basis for the Estuarine Management Plans which are required as part of the new Integrated Coastal Management Act.  Both would contribute towards the better management of impacting activities which are influencing the status of these systems thereby assisting in the restoration and proactive protection of these important ecosystem units. Fortunately a number of the estuaries have been sampled during recent times by MER and this was used recently, together with other recent information to conduct a desktop assessment as part of the National Biodiversity Assessment conducted by SANBI.  
It is extremely important to take into account the regional significance of these eight estuaries.  Although only eight of a total of eighty estuaries these systems are eight out of a total of only nineteen estuaries north of Durban.  In addition, they are immediately adjacent to the estuaries of the eThekwini Municipality which have been recently assessed and found to be in an extremely poor state with only two of sixteen systems in a good condition and the remainder considered to be in poor to degraded condition.  This makes these estuaries even more significant in the role they play on the KZN coast and particularly their role in terms of nursery function for important marine species which utilise these habitats to complete their life cycles.
The desktop assessment provides an indication of Present Ecological Status (PES) and a regional overview of the estuarine area of the municipality as well as the condition of the estuarine resource (Table 5.1).  It can be quickly and clearly seen from this and Figure 5.1 that the estuarine assets of the Kwadukuza Municipality which total 924 ha (a reduced total) are on a negative trajectory.  This is in evidence with only one relatively small estuary (3 ha) being considered to currently exist in a B category (largely natural with few modifications) or Good condition.  This only comprises 0.4% of the estuarine habitat within the municipal area.  No estuaries could be rated in an A category or Excellent condition and no estuaries have any formal protection.  Four of the systems are currently sitting in a category C or Fair condition which contributes 31% of the total estuarine and a total area of 288 ha.  The remaining three are considered to be in poor to highly degraded condition.  One of these, namely the uMvoti estuary, is the only estuary categorised within this stretch of coastline as a river mouth and it is 
considered to be in a category D or Poor condition.  This means that for this estuarine category 100% of the estuarine area is in Poor condition.
The conditions which exist in these systems are a result of poor management of anthropogenic impacting activities and are in many cases considered completely reversible.  This would require proactive interventions and collaboration between various levels of government, NGO’s, landowners and stakeholders.",,In operation,Policy/Strategies/Action Plans

1204,Creating an area of highly complex ecosystems and mature forests in the Añarbe reserve - Municipality of Errenteria,"Municipality of Errenteria, Spain",Spain,"The Añarbe public woodland (1,672 ha) is under pressure from different spheres and the vast majority of the
forestry land-use involves quick growing conifers and deciduous exotic species.  73% of the 
surface area of the municipal district occupied by exotic forestry plantations is the property of Errenteria Local Council itself.
However, in recent years, the local council has embarked on an intense campaign to conserve the biodiversity, recover the 
native species, progressively eliminate the commercial plantations, combat invasive species and undertake 
restoration projects.
In order to improve the ecological functionality of Añarbe, the local council will review and modify the zoning of the  
Aiako Harria Natural Park, pursuant to the Park's PORN (Natural Resources Pan), and will create a Reserve Zone in 910 ha of woodland and restoration 
zones to protect the oak and beech groves. The outcome will thus be that the forested area will consist of  
mature and not fragmented woodland. This will improve the ecological connectivity and the conservation status of the 
natural habits, with the advantage of restoring the ecological functionality of the River Oiartzun. It will also work on an agreement with
Donostia-San Sebastián City Council so that the active conservation zones of the Oberan-Errekabeltz forests are included in the new
reserve zone created.
This measure is expected to notably improve the biological values, along with the capacity to provide environmental  
services for those ecosystems, such as retention of soils, sediments and organic matter from the supply basin of the 
 Añarbe reservoir and, particularly, those that imply the absorption of atmospheric CO2 and social and economic benefits.
Improving the management in this area could make it easier to be include in some conservation funding system, such as 
payments for environmental services or mechanisms to avoid deforestation,  such as the programme on  
Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD), and the possibility of using it on a local scale will be studied.",,In operation,Policy/Strategies/Action Plans
1205,Restoring forestry plantations for protective purposes - Municipality of Errenteria,"Municipality of Errenteria, Spain",Spain,"Forestry is a very widespread activity in the Basque Country. The landscape impact is important, as
generally the plantations consists of exotic species with little ecological value. The impact also includes the matarrasa or clear cuts technique, 
using heavy machinery both for felling and removing the timber, as the main exploitation method. Creating
 tracks for the machinery causes soil erosion, compacting  and loss of organic matter.
In Errenteria, there are tree plantations with exotic trees, such as the Monterrey pine, in public woodland. 
Therefore, the Local Council will embark on a Restoration Plan that enables the replacement of degraded forests and exotic species  
plantations, which contribute fewer ecosystemic services, by leafy native species of the Atlantic forest. 
This action seeks to recover the integrity of the degraded ecosystems and achieve better ecological functionality in the 
area where the intervention takes place. This process will help to mitigate climate change and improve the landscape around Errenteria.
In order to implement this action, Errenteria Local Council will identify the restoration and conservation priorities of the plantation 
zones, establishing a management plan for the current plantations and preventing the extraction of timber once the 
forestry land-use has finished.
On the other hand, a Restoration Plan will be set up which will enable the structural complexity of the Atlantic forest to be addressed. Therefore,
the council will have the support of Gipuzkoa Provincial Council in the management of the restored area.
The species to be used will mainly be oak and beech, along with birch, ash or hawthorn, among others, which are native to the

In February 2002 Kristianstad came close to a catastrophe. A rapid snow melt in the province of Småland caused River Helge to rise rapidly. The old protective levee round Lake Hammarsjön threatened to collapse. On that occasion an emergency rescue operation to reinforce the levees with 50,000 tons of crushed rock saved the town of Kristianstad. It then became obvious that comprehensive measures were necessary in the long-term to protect important social functions and residential areas. Since 2008, Kristianstad east of the river is considerably better prepared to cope with extreme weather conditions. In total 4.5 km of new levees have been built, which can resist the highest possible water level. Effects of future climate change have been considered.

The podcast will have different themes to tell the citizens about the municipality´s work in general.
Another important way to communicate with our citizens is with public dialogues. For example, in May 2015 Sollentuna conducted a public dialogue to find out where Sollentuna's inhabitants think that it is possible to place high buildings and the services that should be in them. 979 houses were placed on a map in the municipality by the inhabitants. Public dialogue is a method of gathering knowledge and the proposals received are treated as a knowledge base for future projects. 
Pubic dialogue also played an important role role in the work with Sollentuna’s Traffic Strategy and Urban Green Structure Strategy in 2014. The municipality put up a web poll where anyone could go in and choose his or her favorite green space in the municipality. Also interviews were held individually and in groups, and expert assessments of the various green spaces. The study resulted in a so-called Sociotope map showing green areas' values from the user perspective and cultural ecosystem services.
Also, in the yearly survey from SCB (Statistics Sweden), Sollentuna added questions for 2014 about what the citizens think about the environment and what the municipality does.

In this situation business as usual is not an option. New approaches are needed creating a safe operating space within the environmental boundaries. BERAS develops and implements practical examples where innovation and entrepreneurship from a multi sectorial engagement flows into realistic fully integrated ecological alternatives for the whole food chain from farmer to consumer.
-BERAS - background and main concepts The BERAS concepts have been developed through two transnational projects part - financed by the European Union and Norway (the Baltic Sea Region Programme), BERAS (2003 – 2006) and BERAS Implementation (2010 – 2013). The concept of Ecological Recycling Agriculture (ERA) is based on many years of research and studies on how organic farms can be organized to be truly sustainable and environment - friendly and has demonstrated its potential related to reduction of nutrient leakage from the farm, soil carbon sequestration/climate effect, biodiversity and increased soil fertility. 
Diet for a Clean Baltic Supporting consumers in their choice of food, be it individual consumers or professional procurers and chefs at restaurants and school kitchens, is one way BERAS Implementation is working to promote ecological recycling agriculture and organic food in general. Our six criteria can guide you in making choices that take into account the wellbeing of the Baltic Sea, protects biodiversity, does not lead to cutting down of rainforest, has positive effects in soil sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere, and avoids unnecessary use of fossil fuels for production of fertilisers and long transports of produce.
The criteria are:
• Good, tasty and healthy food.
• Organic food, preferably from ecological recycling agriculture –for better nutritional value as well as for lesser impact on the environment.
• Local food – to minimize the transport of food.
• Food according to season – reduces costs and increases the variation in food served during the year. Living with seasons requires menus adapted to availability.
• Right balance of food – more vegetables, whole grain and less meat, chicken and pork (80% of vegetables and 20% meat).
• Reducing leftover food – actively minimizing the waste of energy through reductions of leftovers from households and school kitchens.
BERAS Implementation works with chefs from restaurant cuisines and school kitchens, nutrition experts, other food chain experts and food producers from the participating countries. Together with our partners we are compiling food recipes, menus and methods in order to create a delicious and healthy eating experience – and make a difference for a cleaner Baltic Sea.",,,Education/Awareness Raising

Framework for prioritizing efforts to protect

guidelines for restoring river banks and riparian
corridors. An urban tree canopy analysis is
provided (to support the concurrent work of the
City-appointed Urban Forest Committee) and
priorities for ordinance and policy re-evaluation
are suggested to help guide tree planting and
protection efforts. Greening focuses on improving the visual appeal of city streets and better managing stormwater on streets, in parks and on private development parcels. Green Grand Rapids identifies priorities
for greening the street network, illustrates
alternatives for adding permeable, landscaped
areas along street rights-of-way and suggests
other “green streets” strategies. The use of LID
strategies in all public and private development is also explored. A series of four park concept plans
illustrate a range of greening strategies from
native landscapes to underground stormwater
detention tanks that settle out pollutants before release to the storm sewer. Connections focuses on on-street pedestrian and
bicycle improvements, off-street trails and transit. Green Grand Rapids explores how alternatives to travel by car can be improved by adopting a “Complete Streets” approach that re-balances the
use of street rights-of-way to provide sidewalks, on-street bicycle facilities and expanded areas
for street trees and landscaping. Off-street trails, especially those along the Grand River (linking to the regional trail system), are also addressed. A special study provides preliminary engineering
recommendations and costs for the extension of
the existing riverwalk from Fulton Street to the
Wealthy Street Bridge.The Grand River focuses on riverfront mixed use and open space development, the expansion of river-related  recreation opportunities and improving the ecological health of the river

Assemblage Redevelopment Authority), which works to redevelop tax-delinquent and abandoned properties. Community
members, partnering with local non-profits, foundations or churches, will then work to transform these vacant lots into usable,
productive and attractive green spaces. Urban Grows is the first initiative launched as part of Mayor Parker’s new program,
Healthy Houston, which is designed to reduce obesity and increase healthy eating and exercise. Healthy Houston will promote
programs, policies and actions designed to reduce food deserts, promote the availability of locally-grown foods, encourage the

recreation: • Reduced doctor visits due to increased access to recreation opportunities; • Increase in use of alternative
transportation for commuting along the hike and bike trails; • Increase in property values along the corridor resulting in
increased revenue to the city; • Increased flood prevention due to the opportunity for wet-bottom detention areas in the newly
created green spaces; • Increased water quality due to the simple plantings located strategically along the bayous, the
