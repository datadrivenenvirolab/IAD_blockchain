- Planta de Clasificación y Recuperación de Residuos Reciclables:
Esta estructura permitirá mejorar la selección y clasificación de los residuos de la ciudad, recuperar y aprovechar los residuos secos reciclables separados en origen, y disminuir el impacto ambiental de los mismos. Además, facilitará la recepción de los materiales provenientes de la recolección del Programa Separe.
Tendrá capacidad para procesar unas 10 toneladas por hora, y contará con equipamiento y maquinarias para recepción y descarga de camiones de materiales reciclables. Se proyecta también que reciba el material que hoy es rechazado por la planta, pero que aún contiene materiales pasibles de recuperación para su reprocesamiento. Estas operaciones permitirán aumentar la eficiencia del tratamiento de la planta, logrando así una menor cantidad de rechazo enviado a disposición final.
Cabe señalar que esta iniciativa apunta a la inclusión laboral de recuperadores urbanos. Al respecto, para el funcionamiento de esta planta se estima la contratación de alrededor de 40 personas para su operación.
- Biodigestión Seca:
La planta de biodigestión seca permitirá procesar 250 toneladas diarias de residuos domiciliarios, es decir que la ciudad duplicará la capacidad actual de tratamiento y generará energía durante el proceso que podrá abastecer a unos 2.000 hogares. Asimismo, se incorporarán al menos 20 recolectores informales para realizar tareas de clasificación.
Para su implementación se prevé optimizar el proceso de la planta de clasificación y compostaje e incrementar la eficiencia de la operación. Luego, aprovechando la estructura propuesta, se integrarán a su vez nuevos sectores a la existente, lo cual será posible porque el proceso de biodigestión seca planteado se compondrá de tres fases: clasificación, digestión y compostaje, donde el momento inicial y final son similares a los ya realizados en la planta.
- Planta de Compostaje de Residuos Orgánicos Puros:
Para la fracción orgánica pura se necesitará un tratamiento diferenciado al residuo mezclado. Para tales fines se proyecta una nueva planta de compostaje con una capacidad de tratamiento de alrededor de 200 toneladas por día de residuos orgánicos.

There will also be adjustment of lanes, the renovation, enlargements and implementation of bus terminals, and traffic lights’ prioritization integrated with the Mobility Integrated System. It is previewed improvements in pavements and on-level crossings for terminals and stations accessibility and the implementation of integrated bike racks, as well as the removal of cyclists from collective transport sharing to the marginal lanes along the structural axis.
In spite of constant investments in Curitiba and its Metropolitan area’s public transport, the Integrated Transport Network has been facing challenges, mainly due to intense increase in private vehicles’ traffic. There are more than 1.300.000 registered vehicles, creating operational problems for the public transport and mobility in general. Congested traffic has generated increase in time travels and difficulty in maintaining the system’s frequency, discouraging the use of mass transport because of lack of regularity.
Policies towards mass transport prioritization has always kept Curitiba worried about seeking for viable solutions, linked with urban and metropolitan development of its mass transport.
In this perspective, where it has always sought to advance in the future, the current need for more advancements in solutions in the city’s transport system is vital. The consolidation of the Structural Axes and the integration with the Metropolitan area has made the seeking for new adequate technologies to mass transit demand necessary. In order to do so, the Municipality has developed several projects aiming the increase in the system’s capacity.

There are 24 buses carrying 68.000 passengers a day.

The intention is to encourage more and more sustainable mobility in the most varied types of trips in Fortaleza, which is on the right track and continues to advance with the goal of becoming the most cycling city in Brazil. Its objectives are to stimulate the use of bicycles in everyday life and not only as a leisure tool, to increase the extension and coverage of other areas not yet covered by cycle paths and cycling routes, to promote traffic education and pedestrian safety campaigns (BRT, Metrô and VLT) and exclusive bus lanes, implement the shared car system and use biofuels in the fleet of vehicles in the service of the municipality.",Plano de Ações Imediatas em Transito e Transporte de Fortaleza – PAITT   - Municipality of Fortaleza,,In operation,Action plan
360,"Municipality of Fortaleza, Brazil",Brazil,"In 2014, the Integrated Cycle Route Master Plan (PDCI) was launched. The same is a strategic plan that will provide the city with effective tools and infrastructure for the implementation of a cycle network, integrated with the public passenger transport system and urban equipment, and for encouraging the use of non-motorized means of transportation.
According to PDCI, the city has 74.7 km of cycle paths and 10.9 km of cycle tracks, totaling 85.6 km of cycling network. The total extension planned for the year 2030 will be 524.2 km, with 275.5km of cyclepaths; 122.3km of cycletracks; 122,1km of cyclorotes; And 4.4 km of shared sidewalk. The PDCI defines the strategies related to infrastructure and proposes the development of three lines of work:
• Structuring network: the development of a structuring network aims to contribute to cycling mobility on the scale of the city, providing greater comfort in long journeys (between neighborhoods). They are direct routes and without deviation and mainly bicycle lanes;
• Complementary network: it is the cycle network that structures the mobility in bicycle within the neighborhoods. It allows the internal displacements and the connections with the structuring network and the terminals of public transport. Mainly cyclepaths, cycleroutes and areas with traffic calming;
• Complementary infrastructure: the complementary infrastructure is mainly the implantation of the elements related to the parking (implementation of paracycles, bicycles racks) and improvement of bicycle intermodality - public transport.
Another action of the City Hall is the Leisure Cycle Course. The PAITT in partnership with AMC (Municipal Transit Authority), ETUFOR (Fortaleza Urban Transport Company) and Via Livre Consortium promote a route along the main avenues of the city on Sundays. It operates from 7:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and aims to encourage the population to exercise, have a free leisure option and promote the use of the bicycle as a means of transportation. The routes vary every Sunday and, along the same, there is medical and police support. The project was extended in the year of 2015. Two more routes were added and the timetable extended from 7am to 4pm. As benefits of this action, can be cited:
• Reduction of air and noise pollution;
• Improvement of the health of the population with the practice of physical exercise;
• Increased levels of security, as the population will enjoy more of the urban space. Consequently streets, parks and squares will be more inhabited;
• Division of road space in a more democratic and fair way;
• Free leisure space;

O importante é que uma maior fluidez no trânsito não significa uma maior velocidade. Pelo contrário. A velocidade média do trânsito será menor mas o motorista chegará mais rápido ao seu destino. Isso ocorre pois se o motorista insistir em se deslocar mais rápido do que o previsto, perderá a vantagem da cronometragem dos sinais e terá que parar mais a frente.
Ganhos também ambientais e de segurança

Blatchford Redevelopment: The purpose of this project is to transform 535 acres in the heart of Edmonton into one of the world’s largest sustainable communities. The neighbourhood will create an opportunity for 30,000 residents to live a unique and sustainable lifestyle.  Driven by City Council’s vision to create a community that significantly reduces its ecological footprint and empowers residents to pursue sustainable lifestyle choices, Blatchford is a leading-by-example opportunity to showcase Edmonton’s commitment to becoming an energy sustainable city. The community will incorporate best practices for sustainable urban design including increasing density; prioritizing design that promotes walking, cycling or transit; creating a mix of housing, retail, commercial and public spaces; and incorporating significant park and green spaces.  On December 8, 2016, City Council approved the community energy strategy, including the framework for a renewable energy utility that will further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enable the effective use of energy. The plan relies on the following three strategies: o Conservation: All buildings in Blatchford will incorporate green building features to reduce the amount of energy required. o Efficiency: An ambient district energy sharing system (DESS) will provide heating, cooling and domestic hot water for the buildings in Blatchford. It will be capable of sharing energy between buildings, neighbourhoods and seasons, significantly reducing overall energy demand.  o Renewables: The use of on-site renewable energy sources including geo-exchange, solar PV and sewer heat exchange. Next Steps: After years of necessary planning, design, engineering and site preparation work, construction for the first residential stage and a section of the central park starts in spring 2017.

637,"City of North Vancouver, Canada",Canada,"Currently, new buildings in North America are built to a fairly low energy efficiency standard in comparison to codes and standards in Europe.  Until recently, all construction in the City of North Vancouver was built to energy standards of the British Columbia building code.  Cities in in the Province of British Columbia (with the exception of Vancouver) lack the ability to require efficiency standards exceeding the B.C. code.  Given this barrier, the City is the first municipality in British Columbia to implement a strategic and proactive policy in which new zoning amendments will give new buildings a density bonus in return for energy efficient design.  These innovative zoning amendments do not increase the allowable density on a property, but will permit additional floor area over a base threshold of permitted density, up to the Official Community Plan maximum densities. In turn, developers must meet the 90.1 2007 energy performance standard set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) for industrial, commercial, institutional, and tall (over 5 storey) residential buildings. For residential buildings four storeys and under, developers are required to meet the federal EnerGuide 80 standard in order to earn their density bonuses.  The City’s novel approach of incentivizing higher energy performance has resulted almost all new buildings being built to or in many cases exceeding the higher energy standards.

For the study, natural gas and water consumption meters were installed.  A data logger was also installed to help identify potential operational improvements.  A 2-year monitoring and verification program was also included as part of the agreement with the system designer / installer.

The system is used to heat domestic hot water supplied to washroom sinks, reducing natural gas purchases.  The system components include 80 evacuated collector tubes in racks, two 880 litre solar storage tanks, a double wall heat-exchanger and a Resol differential temperature controller.  The tubes and racks cover a 20m2 area.

A unique drain-back design provides freeze- and overheating-protection for the system. When the temperature is too low or too high for the system to operate safely and effectively, the system simply shuts off and the heat transfer water inside gravity-drains to a tank, where it is re-circulated when normal operating temperatures are reached.  Other systems typically add a food-grade glycol to the heat transfer fluid for freeze protection, which causes a slight efficiency loss in the system and also adds a maintenance requirement and cost.  A cooling fan can be used to dissipate heat to protect against overheating.  However, the heat is lost.

This process follows high technical and environmental standards.
There is a street sweeping coverage of 760 km of road per day, 30 km of which are done through a mechanized process in 21 parochial urban centers. The per capita generation is of 0.524 kg. per inhabitant per day (year 2016), indicating an approximate total of 350 tons of solid waste per day.
Cantonal coverage: 98.6% (urban and rural area).
The sanitary landfill is one of the components of the ""Pichacay Human and Environmental Development Complex."" It is located in the parish of Santa Ana, 21km from the city of Cuenca.
Through the implementation of the project, the following environmental results are expected:
- The reduction of CO2 pollution resulting from 14 thousand vehicles circulating daily in Cuenca; equivalent to 75,000 metric tons of CO2. 
- Electricity will be available for 8,000 families.
The investment of the project is of 3,000,000 dollars, with EMAC EP being the primary contributor with 51% of the budget.
The construction of this project involves the drilling of 30 deep wells to extract the biogas and lead it to a system that removes its moisture. The latter then channels the product through a high-density polyethylene pipe, connected to two generators of 1MW power each.

It is in this context that the tramway is being implemented as a backbone of the integrated transport system of Cuenca. At completion, it will have a length of 21.4 km, transport 106,000 passengers per day, travel at an average speed of 22 km / h, and avoid the current emission of 11,000 ton / year of CO2. The total cost of the project is $232,000,000. Currently, the project is 80% complete.
Ongoing projects pertaining to mobility and services reflect a major step towards more sustainable transportation system, both in terms of the construction of the tramway and the integrated public transport system.
Municipal actions have been put in place that have lead to a progressive rationalization and restriction of the parking of private vehicles in public spaces: new infrastructure projects and the removal of parking spots on public streets. 
In short, the objective is to replace the mobility patterns linked to motorized private traffic by more sustainable alternatives such as a bicycle, walking, or public transport.
As a small city, distances to travel in Cuenca are relatively short and reasonable. Sectors of the city, primarily in the historical center, that experience the most traffic and congestion will be the most susceptible to change regarding road access to foot traffic. 
The Plan of Mobility and Public Space aims to: reduce the dependency on private vehicles, reduce the average length of travel (urban dispersion), reduce the number of motorized trips, and encourage alternative modes of transportation.
The main strategies of the project are: the generation of public policies to ""rationally"" order the transit; the reordering and reorganization of the public transport system and the development of campaigns to promote a change of behavior among citizens, the generation of citizen awareness, the prioritization of pedestrian movement in city planning, through “Integrated Transportation Systems”, an increase in the percentage of cycling, the implementation of an efficient and effective Transportation Model that facilitates the mobility of the population (vehicular and pedestrian) and the regulation and control of traffic, to provide the necessary technological platform for the integration of mobility services, recovery, regulation and maintenance of public space and encourage their use and enjoyment. 
The Mobility Plan involves in its construction all the actors of mobility that will allow the resulting model to parallel the characteristics of a compact and densified city. A city that will rescue public spaces for its citizens and look to include additional neighborhoods to its historical patrimony.

1352,"Municipality of Cuenca, Ecuador",Ecuador,"In Cuenca, there are approximately 550 artisan bricklayers who maintain traditional productive processes that are not energy efficient and generate significant environmental impacts.
Craft bricklayers mostly use fuels with high environmental impacts in low-energy furnaces. This process affects the air quality of nearby settlements and emits greenhouse gases that impact climate change and human health. The use of firewood, tires, and plastics among other fuels also contribute significantly to air pollution, deforestation, and water availability, all the while increasing the causes of climate change.
Per the information available in the emissions inventory of the Cuenca canton, the brick industry is the second generator of carbon monoxide (CO) after vehicular traffic with 2465 Ton / year. In addition, vehicular traffic is the main generator of particles (PM10). 
The Municipality of Cuenca, as responsible for the sustainable development of its jurisdiction and concerned about the need to implement energy efficiency mechanisms in the highly polluting production of artisanal bricks, has considered it a priority to develop actions and activities aimed at improving the living conditions of artisan brick producers and therefore significantly reduce the GHG emission. Through the Energy Efficiency Project in EELA Ladrilleras, it is part of the Regional Project that was developed for artisanal bricklayers in seven Latin American countries (Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil and Argentina) in order to mitigate climate change through the reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) and improve the quality of life of brick producers, the impact of public environmental policies related to bricklaying, and the technical support to implement adequate technologies aimed at improving the production process, the integral management, and the energy efficiency of the brick industry. The goal of this project is to reduce the pollution and the emission of GHG.
Through the implementation of technology and the construction of efficient furnaces, the Municipality of Cuenca has achieved a reduction of around 15,000 tons CO2 per year and witnessed an increase in the profits of the bricklayers.
At the same time, these results are to be expected: fuel saving, reduction of burning time, increase of production, products of better quality, the reduction of black smoke, and the improvement of the working conditions of the brick industry.",Energy Efficiency in Cuenca’s Artisanal Brick Industry - Municipality of Cuenca,2010,In operation,Technical / Infrastructural

5. Users of commercial vehicles and cargo 
6. Users of light vehicles with low occupancy 

Today, 56% of the city’s carbon footprint comes from the transport sector. The Municipality is working in several mobility actions that can potentially reduce 1,368,109 tCO2e over the next ten years: 
•         Public transport - Metropolitan Integrated Mass Transport System: Strengthening public transport is the main management proposal to improve sustainable mobility in the city (since there are nearly 4 million trips per day in Quito, of which 75% are by public transport). Besides saving energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, this initiative will reduce air pollution, improve road safety, reduce waiting and transport times, reduce maintenance costs of vehicles and therefore improve citizens’ quality of life. The specific actions are: 
  Quito’s Metro.- The first subway line is being constructed and it is expected to start operation by 2017, with an estimated of 450,000 passengers per day in the first year; with 22 km in length (19.3 km underground and 1.7 km in surface), 15 operative stations and 4 reserve stations (3 intermodal transfer stations), 8 trains with 6 wagons each (108 wagons in total), with an average speed of 37 km/h, transporting 1,500 people per train ride. 
  Metrobus-Q Subsystem.- Creation of new fast transport buses (BRT) and trolley bus corridors with exclusive lanes (electric and diesel articulated buses), and optimization of the existing ones, in consideration of the Metro system. 920,000 passengers are being transported with this mode.
  ""Quito Cables"".- The first of four lines of an innovative cable car system is being constructed, allowing people to transport by air from the outskirts to the main stations of the Metropolitan Integrated Mass Transport System.
  Fare integration of different public transport modes and adoption of technologies and information tools for users.
•         Traffic management: Implementation of actions to reduce the use of individual vehicles, like the “Pico y Placa” system (each day vehicles with certain plate digits can’t circulate), the ""Blue Zone"" rotary and tariffed parking system (max. 2 hour of street parking with a fare of US$ 0.40/h), and a new centralized and adaptive traffic light system.",Sustainable Mobility: Integrated Transport System - Municipality of the Metropolitan District of Quito,,In operation,Policy/Strategies/Action Plans
1355,"Municipality of the Metropolitan District of Quito, Ecuador",Ecuador,"Since 2002, the Municipality of the Metropolitan District of Quito has promoted the practice of urban agriculture within the city through the emblematic project “Participatory Urban Agriculture – AGRUPAR”. This multidimensional project works as a local economic development, social cohesion and urban resilience strategy that integrates agriculture, livestock production, solidarity harvest exchange, food processing, surplus marketing and local environmental management, contributing to food security and sovereignty, urban agro-ecology and nutrition. The project has technified its intervention through productive infrastructure, as low-cost micro-greenhouses, water harvesting and drip irrigation specially designed for small production units. 
AGRUPAR seeks to improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable population of the District, working with women (85,71% of participants) and female headed households, the elderly, children and youth, people with special needs or disabilities, refugees, migrants, unemployed people, shelters, health centers, schools, associations, addiction and social rehabilitation centers, and anyone who wants to be part of this innovative approach to food self-sufficiency. 
The project seeks to strengthen the technical capacities of urban and peri-urban farmers and the formation of human capital, along with increasing sustainable and safe agricultural production and agribusiness, focusing on microenterprise management with access to different markets. AGRUPAR improves participants’ earnings by generating jobs, as well as helping them to save money by consuming their own production. The program has being a ""seedbed"" of agricultural micro-business of all kinds, such as production of organic vegetables, fruits, crops, medicinal and ornamental plants, animal husbandry, beekeeping and food processing (flour, bread, preserved or dehydrated food, snacks, dairy products and meats)
Urban agriculture is practiced in public and private vacant land, gardens, balconies, terraces, pots or containers, using recycled materials such as plastic bottles and tubes, tires, pallets and glass. There are 352,600 beneficiaries of the program (56,000 urban farmers with their families and 170,000 responsible consumers). AGRUPAR has trained 16,700 participants, opened 2,500 urban gardens and promoted 110 urban agriculture startups with 105 different food products; investing US$ per year.
Moreover, since 2006 the program has lauched 14 bio markets called ""bioferias"", special spaces located at strategic locations of the District for the weekly sale of products by urban farmers who are part of AGRUPAR. The bioferias have become an educational space of permanent offering of healthy, safe and qualified food (fresh surplus from garden production), fostering a direct relationship between producers and consumers, within a framework of fair price and weight and a welcoming atmosphere, providing a solidarity economy.
The organic food supply of urban agriculture increases Quito’s self-sufficiency rate, reducing carbon emissions. Its practice is an adaptation response to climate change and a way to build a more resilient District, by increasing biodiversity, recovering degraded ecosystems, promoting rational use of resources, water efficiency and revaluation of urban land for food production, as well as generating citizen participation and solidarity within local economic development.

The public Metropolitan Company of Solid Waste Management (EMGIRS) is in charge of Quito’s sanitary landfill “El Inga”, located 40km northeast of the city with an area of 58ha, where collected domestic solid waste of the city and 33 rural parishes is deposited since 2003 (approximately 1,900 tons per day, of which 57% is organic waste, 24% is recyclable waste and 19% are rejections). Several infrastructural and extension adjustments are being developed in this sanitary landfill, based on its rate of current disposal and the volumetric compacted weight (0.89 t/m3), increasing its availability for five more years. 
There is a pipeline network to capture biogas within all the sanitary landfill “El Inga”, which leads to a fireplace where biogas is incinerated, performed at 4 hours per day.
With an investment of about US$ 7 million, at the end of 2015 there will be a biogas power plant assembled inside the “El Inga” sanitary landfill, beginning to generate 2MW/h, and expecting to generate 5MW/h for late 2016. The generation of electrical energy through Quito’s sanitary landfill biogas contributes to the national grid, as a source of non-conventional renewable energy, supporting the new national energy matrix, and mitigates environmental impact caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, in this case, methane.

1358,"Municipality of the Metropolitan District of Quito, Ecuador",Ecuador,"This project consists of the modernization, replacement and expansion of the public lighting system of the Metropolitan District of Quito (DMQ), replacing conventional luminaires (about 223.000) for efficient public lighting, promoting energy efficiency and citizen security, towards reducing the city’s carbon footprint and generating savings for citizens and the municipal government. A total replacement of conventional luminaires could mean lowering to half (0.5%) the contribution of public lighting to the carbon footprint of Quito, which is relevant in the framework of the city’s proposed reduction target of 5% compared to the tendency scenario, beginning in 2018. It is considered that almost all of the current lamps (metal halide, sodium vapor and mercury vapor) are susceptible to replacement for LED lamps. Taking a referential cost of US$ 700 per luminaire, the replacement investment would be about US$ 137 million over 5 years. Within 20 years, which is the lifetime of LED luminaires, the accumulated electricity consumption savings based on current electricity prices would be of US$ 137 million, and 10 million of accumulated savings in maintenance, giving a total savings of US$ 147 million.
The project promotes energy security, by reducing electricity consumption in public lighting (6% of total electricity consumption in the city; twice the regional average), and possible replication in other major cities, energy demand is reduced, increasing the margin between electricity supply and demand in the country. Also, installation of LED lamps, which have better efficiency rates (conversion of energy into luminous flux) than conventional lamps, improves lighting levels within public space and reduces visual pollution and light waste. Because of their physical strength and technology, LED lamps have a much higher life time (up to 40 times) than conventional incandescent lamps, and they can be recycled. Therefore its final disposal is less common, besides being less polluting, since they don’t contain mercury or sodium, which means lower extraction and environmental exposure of these minerals, as well as economic savings. The project improves electricity access, since saved energy can be distributed to users who do not currently have access to electricity services at homes, businesses and industries. Moreover, a suitable lightning design improves light levels, increasing security and the aesthetic appeal of the city for residents and visitors. 
In cooperation with the national government, the local electricity public company (Empresa Eléctrica de Quito - EEQ) and private stakeholders, in recent years the municipality has rehabilitated and optimized public lighting, focusing efforts in the historic center of Quito, where 2,940 conventional bulbs have been replaced with efficient lighting systems (LED), with an investment of US$ 3 million, implying reduction in consumption equivalent to US$ 128,000 per year, which represents the displacement of 715,000 tCO2e. 
The next step of the project is to replace ornamental street lighting in Quito, located in urban parks and green areas, meaning the replacement of 1,756 luminaries mostly concentrated in posts (77%), the ground (17%) and facades (6%), with a budget of approximately US$ 1 million.

According to the Vegetation and Land Cover map (2011) of the DMQ, the Natural Heritage covers an area of 256,407 ha, corresponding to 60.46% of the entire surface of the District; distributed in 17 vegetation ecosystems, 124,818 ha of rainforest (29.4%), 722 ha of dry forest (0.1%), 51,213 ha of wet shrubs (12.0%), 42,487 ha of dry shrubs (10%), 44,890 ha of wet grassland (10.6%) and 2,668 ha of dry grassland (0.6%). There are large areas of natural regeneration, subdivided into seven subclasses. Thus, the secondary Forest constitutes 3.66% of the DMQ, especially in the Northwest rainforest, marking the beginning of the Choco Bioregion.
Regarding the detected flora and fauna of the District, 21,490 plants have been recorded, of which 254 species are endemic; there are 111 mammal species registered (28.5% of the national total), including threatened species like the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), the endangered Ecuadorian capuchin (Cebus albifrons aequatorialis), the black howler monkey (Alouatta palliata) and the dwarf deer (Pudu mephistophiles); 540 bird species have been recorded (33.4% of the national total); and there are 139 herpetofauna species registered, 90 amphibians and 49 reptiles (33 Ecuadorian endemic species and  40 threatened species)..
This great biodiversity is part of the District’s Natural Heritage, which must be preserved as a hope of life for present and future generations. The strategic lines for its management are summarized as follows: 
•         Management based on the conservation state of natural areas;
•         Strengthening of management oriented to ensure natural ecosystem functionality; 
•         Categorization of sustainable rural land use; 
•         Integration of the Green Urban Network with the Metropolitan Protected Natural Areas Subsystem; and,
•         Strengthening the functionality of roads as public green space and alternative mobility.
This set of policies are generating initial indicators to reverse the rate of deforestation in the DMQ, allowing to quantify greenhouse gases emissions from the land use and land use change sectors. According to the carbon content indicators of the current National Forest Assessment, there are 118,000 hectares of different forest types in the DMQ, with a stock of 10.4 million tons of carbon.
The Secretariat of Environment of the DMQ works in a Carbon Footprint Compensation Mechanism (greenhouse gases emissions), which aims to implement actions of local sustainability with a potential reduction of the carbon footprint, to be financed with resources from territorial actors interested in offsetting their emissions that are no longer feasible to reduce, in the context of their sustainability policies. One of the compensation options is precisely to maintain and manage forest areas where avoided deforestation is guaranteed.","Forests, Compensation and Avoided Deforestation - Municipality of the Metropolitan District of Quito",,In operation,Public Participation/Stakeholder engagement

Infrastructure consists of building main sewage pipes and secondary marginal collectors, which convey wastewater to water recovery plants by a gravity system, saving electricity by avoiding the use of an electric pumping system. Interceptors will be installed, making bad odors disappear, improving the air quality and allowing peaceful citizen coexistence near the now polluted rivers. 
The project will also improve the population’s quality of life, promote peaceful coexistence and generate job opportunities, as it proposes to transform the rivers’ degraded influence zones into usable areas for irrigation and hydropower, as well as green areas for recreation and landscaping, potential ecological corridors for biodiversity protection. 
In addition, the project proposes renewable electricity generation by building three hydropower plants spread across waterfalls along the path of the main sewage pipe of 34 km long that runs through the city, generating an installed capacity of 40,3 MW/h of clean energy. Besides turning the project self-sustaining, the generated electricity will allow the sale of excess production (28 MW/h) to the electricity distribution system within the city or the country. This will avoid thermoelectric generation, leading to economic savings by avoiding the use of fossil fuels and at the same time reducing greenhouse gases emissions into the atmosphere.
Furthermore, the project proposes capacity building in communities through the implementation of an education program to carry best environmental practices such as the use of biodegradable detergents and an adequate use and disposal of fats and oils. A Plan of Industrial Pollution Control will also be implemented, which will allow monitoring and controlling emissions of the industries located in the area of influence, whose discharges should be free of toxic substances that could alter the processes of the water recovery plants.
It is a project of great importance with transboundary impacts of water sanitation and electricity generation, benefiting in 2040 about 4.7 million people living in three of Quito’s neighbor Cantons (Rumiñahui, Mejía and Pedro Moncayo), which will not only treat the wastewater of 99% of the region’s population, but will generate a potential reduction of 148,271.46 tCO2e per year and a 85% reduction of the water footprint of the city of Quito. The use of clean technology for domestic and industrial wastewater sanitation, through methane recovery processes and hydroelectric generation, will allow environmental and financial sustainability of the project.

The Solidarity Workshop aims to develop advice on energy matters for the inhabitants to counter energy precariousness in the area.
This particularly innovative project converges with the three pillars of sustainable development: reducing greenhouse gas emissions and protecting the environment, and social and economic development.
Unique in France, it sustains a social project that is financially autonomous and there for the duration around well-being at home, living better together and helping people really adopt eco-friendly practices. It was designed to be welcoming and attractive, this being essential for it to work in a “city policy” neighbourhood.
Right from the start, the Solidarity Workshop project wagered on co-construction bringing around Habitat Toulouse (the social landlord), EDF (electricity grid), CAF (family allowances), Toulouse Métropole and other participants like DIY chain store Leroy Merlin, neighbourhood associations, metropolitan Espace Info Énergie and the inhabitants.
The Compagnons Bâtisseurs association has been keeping the Solidarity Workshop going since the summer of 2015, through professional advice, teaching people and raising awareness about eco-friendly practices, training in DIY, swopping and lending equipment and access to materials at low cost.
The place is there to stay, being located right in the centre of the Empalot neighbourhood where it receives the inhabitants free of charge to address their concerns relating to housing conditions. This innovative initiative helps strengthen the social fabric in the neighbourhood, providing a friendly place for neighbours to meet up and contributes to a new impetus there based on collective workshops.
The Solidarity Workshop is developing awareness raising initiatives thanks to community events, training initiatives on renovation works, accompaniment at home of families and lending the tools needed for works. The workshop should allow people to get on with it, from raising awareness through to actually conducting works.
This programme derives from an agreement between EDF and Toulouse Métropole. It rounds off a series of provisions to mobilise the inhabitants around energy and water savings in their homes and includes the Families Positive Energy Challenge, the Bellefontaine show flat, regional events put on by Espace Info Energie, accompaniment of social landlords, etc. 
The project is constructed in a participative manner: the inhabitants are highly mobilised and involved in the initiative. The workshop’s dynamics are very much part of an “eco-citizen” mobilisation.

1501,"Toulouse Metropolis, France",France,"Toulouse’s objective is to reduce the annual electrical consumption of street lighting by 3 gigawatt hours by 2020.
A number of studies have been initiated across the Metropolis to protect biodiversity by attenuating nocturnal pollution and ensuring dark night extinctions.
Nowadays, public lighting is the object of everyone’s attention. Between making people feel safer, offering friendlier living areas and highlighting the historic heritage, public lighting represents in France 50% of the electricity budget of cities, towns and villages. In Toulouse, the City assigns 40% of its energy budget to this item, that is 4 million euros, representing a major issue. Today, faced with light pollution and the objective of reducing our energy consumption, Toulouse has opted for innovation.
A technology based on Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) that are more sober in energy consumption and with a longer lifetime than conventional elements is being adopted, accompanied by movement detection street lights. The tests conducted show that this technology can reduce energy consumption by 70% compared with a conventional lamp post. During off-peak hours, light pollution can be reduced.
Pedestrian and cycle paths will benefit from special attention, especially for the tracks that run along the Canal du Midi and that are in the dark at night. The goal is to favour the use of soft modes of transport, even at night, by improving the conditions for travel.
On the renewable energy side, the two municipally run hydroelectric power stations generate the equivalent of two thirds of the consumption of Toulouse’s street lighting. 
In addition, Toulouse Métropole has renegotiated its contracts with the energy suppliers by including a clause for the boosting of the share of renewable energies in the mix, thus allowing the energy bill to be reduced by 400,000 euros in two years.",Energy – Public lighting - Toulouse Metropolis,,In operation,Technical/Infrastructure investment
1502,"Toulouse Metropolis, France",France,"The SO Grid objective is to develop a communication network that is flexible and remote controlled right through to the customer’s meter, which will represent an unprecedented technological revolution. It will allow the energy transition and new modes of consumption to be heralded in.
The SO Grid project will allow for real time control of electrical consumption by the consumer and boost quality of services. This represents a first stage in anticipation and accompaniment of new ways of using electricity, especially with the arrival of decentralised renewable energies, and anticipating peaks in consumption due to the use of electric vehicles.
In terms of the quality of service provided, this major improvement will allow for real time control and the possibility of acting remotely and more rapidly in the event of a failure and ensure at all times the match between production and consumption, especially when the latter peaks.
A smart neighbourhood is a modern neighbourhood, with easier living, greater co-operation and less expense. The city wagers on the highest performance technologies and large scale open data to make citizens' lives easier and make public intervention more effective.
This project includes a strong territorial dimension, the “SO” of “SO Grid” clearly denoting the South West (Sud-Ouest) of France. 
Toulouse is a land of innovations (with a large number of researchers and students and three competitiveness clusters) right at the heart of the first French region in research and development expenditure. 
The SO Grid project came in response to the call for expression of interest launched by ADEME (the French Agency for the Environment and Energy Management) on intelligent electrical networks. 
The development of smart grids, which is in the test phase in the Empalot neighbourhood, has also been necessitated by the arrival of decentralised renewable energy sources over the network (wind power, photovoltaic, positive energy buildings, etc.) and new needs with 2 million electric vehicles by 2020. 
This experience fits in with a global approach aiming to develop smart grids, and especially a complete communication chain over all the electricity distribution networks based on PLC (Power Line Communication).
The SOGRID project involves building the global communication chain that will enable all items of equipment placed on the low and medium voltage networks to communicate directly via the electrical network. In concrete terms, the consortium bringing together ten partners around ERDF (the French electricity grid) and STMicroelectronics will develop a new generation electronic chip, equipment that will take that chip on board and the software to run the show. This global system will be developed according to the new PLC communication protocol where digital data can be transmitted over the electrical network.",Energy – The intelligent electrical network – So grid  - Toulouse Metropolis,,In operation,Technical/Infrastructure investment

Thanks to this plan, 7,700 tonnes of plastic have been avoided and 44,000 plastic bottles not consumed.
To reduce the impact of transports on Toulouse Metropole agents, the employees can use the city bikes, training sessions in eco-driving are run and Toulouse Metropole encourages car-sharing with provision of car parks for carpoolers and develops electric vehicle fleets.
Toulouse Métropole is developing a charter on eco-responsible events. Thus, festivity organisers in the agglomeration commit to reducing their environmental impact and cut down on waste, as for example with the use of consigned beakers and dishes.
The second approach concerns responsible purchasing policy. Half the greenhouse effect emissions in the region derive from economic activities. The quest for sobriety in our modes of production and consumption is essential to adapt to climate disruption and the increasing scarcity of resources. Thus, Toulouse Métropole has committed to a responsible purchasing policy with a low environmental impact and high value added for professional integration. Their accumulated budgets for the purchase of supplies, works and services come to 566 million euros a year. Toulouse Métropole's purchasing policy could be summarised by the slogan “Let's team up to buy better”. The local authority represents one of the first local clusters of purchasers in the region. Public ordering is an economic lever and also a lever for local jobs. A broad range of actions thus aims to help SMEs gain access to public contracts as with the simplification of applications.

For a number of years now, Toulouse Métropole has put an emphasis on soft mobility and more especially cycling. There is no better way to take advantage of the banks of the Garonne, wander round the city, go to work or take enjoy the many parks and gardens the metropolis offers than to cycle round.
By bike, you can get there faster than by car over some 400 bike paths, including 63 in peaceful areas (with a 19 mile stretch, a meet-up area and a pedestrian area) and 227 miles of green itineraries not to forget the 1,373 dedicated bike parking spots.
Two Smartphone applications and websites now make life easier for cyclists and encourage people to take to the bike. 
The first application, “Géovelo”, helps you easily and quickly work out your bike path. Géovelo calculates your trip and offers you an itinerary suited to your cycling habits and what you want, from the safest route to the quickest.
The second application, initiated by the Vélo Toulouse association won the Innovation prize in the “Talent of the bike 2013” competition. This mapping application for signposting serves as an interface with Toulouse Métropole allowing users to report problems encountered during their travels, take in photos and suggest solutions. Users' comments are validated by the association's moderator before being sent to Toulouse Métropole. To date, all remarks have received a response from the agglomeration followed by the necessary improvements.
To take advantage of this quality network, there is no need to buy a bike (especially with the storage problems that means for city-dwellers). Vélo Toulouse has made a whole network of bikes that are quick and easy to use available to the inhabitants pretty much everywhere around the city. Thus, for a modest sum of about 0.50 euros after the first free half hour you can borrow a bike and cycle where you want. In 2014, 4.3 million bike hires were recorded, proof of the project's success.

“The best waste is the waste you don't produce”
Prevention covers the quantitative aspect and the qualitative aspect (reducing the harmfulness of waste) around a number of emblematic actions:
* Implementatin of a biogas plant from sewage sludge in order to recover and develop the local gas and heat
* pursuing and developing fermentable waste by promoting composting at the foot of blocks of flats and subsidising the acquisition of individual composters. More than 1,000 composters are distributed each year over the urban district and more than 500 households take part in a composting operation either down at the bottom of the building or in public gardens. This means 1,700 tonnes of waste diverted or the equivalent of 40 kilos of kitchen waste per person a year avoided thanks to composting. The figures speak for themselves and make you want to just dig in!
* The “stop pub” campaign against advertising leaflets in the letterbox has avoided 824 tonnes of paper wasted;
* The development of used textile collection with 320 collection points has allowed 2,350 tonnes of textiles, linen and shoes to see a second life and help the long-term unemployed get back to work;
* Promoting recycling, re-use, and repair. Toulouse Métropole has created a “Ressourcerie” with the association Glanerie to encourage the recycling of waste based on rubbish dump collections. Thus, 30 reintegrated employees repair and bring up to date objects before selling them in the Ressourcerie store;
* Acting against food waste. The “Gourmet bag” operation (the French doggy bag) is being developed in Toulouse allowing restaurant goers to take away their unfinished meals. Toulouse Métropole is also setting up diagnostics on losses in canteens and devising actions to reduce and recycle waste food.  
* Raising awareness and mobilising economic players around the reduction in waste: action to raise the awareness of building industry professionals by creating an ecoconstruction centre. The objective is to create a showcase and technical platform for training in ecoconstruction. The issues are to reduce the carbon footprint of construction, make visible the emergence of innovative economic activities around ecomaterials and give a boost to the acquisition of skills in building construction related trades and professions. 
* The Metropolis relies on a team of 19 sorting ambassadors to ensure communication out in the field, meeting the inhabitants, explaining sorting instructions (16,000 people a year counselled), taking part in events organised by Toulouse Métropole as with Sustainable Development Week, soup kitchen discos, designing leaflets to raise awareness on food waste and intervening in classrooms to get the message across to children.

With new high quality and frequency Linéo bus routes, extension of the tramway linking the airport to a multimodal platform (all for the price of a metro ticket and valid over the entire network) and a project for new metro lines, the whole package is being extended. In 2014, the public transport network counted 174 million trips. The Metropolis wants now to make soft mode transport a boon for users.
The Metropolis supports the development of a carpooling platform, Coovia, over the agglomeration. This application offers direct links from the subscriber's position to their destination, combining public transport, the Vélib bike hire service and carpooling. The passenger benefits from timesaving and the driver receives remuneration for their carpooling. A win-win approach that has convinced 4,000 registered participants and 800 active carpoolers. To date, 1,200 trips are being made daily, representing time saving for the user, remuneration for the driver and a reduction in greenhouse effect gases and congestion for the Metropolis.
For users who have occasional needs for vehicles, the Metropolis has a carsharing network. Known as Citiz, the network makes 39 vehicles available at 22 stations. The icing on the cake is that the network now includes 4 electric vehicles and gradually the whole fleet will be replaced by this type of car. In 2014, 1,200 drivers were signed up for carsharing.
The future multimodal transport infrastructure will ensure continuity of transport between the Borderouge metro station and the town of Bruguières. This project, named BUN (for Boulevard Urbain Nord), fits into the urban development of the Metropolis undergoing major expansion. Thus, with a constant increase in the population and travelling and 15,000 new inhabitants every year, BUN represents a decisive potential for urbanisation and economic development for the North Toulouse area.
The objectives are to co-ordinate a city project, with landscaping and sustainable infrastructure via the development of a lane for the circulation of vehicles with 2 people in them over 8 miles, arranging for bus lanes offering a high level of service connecting the metro station through to the north of the Metropolis, and via pedestrian and cycle paths.
Finally, to limit short distance vehicle travel, the Metropolis is supporting walking buses offering safety vests for children and improving route signposting. This walking bus system for primary and nursery school children is being developed over the area. There are a number of objectives including reducing greenhouse effect gases and traffic congestion near schools and letting the children start the day by getting their legs working, all in a friendly atmosphere.","ACTION 14 – Soft mobility : cohesion and territorial dynamism thanks to multimodal infrastructures – extension of the metro and the tramway networks, cycle paths, shared bikes, carpooling and carsharing - Toulouse Metropolis",,In operation,Technical/Infrastructure investment
1509,"Toulouse Metropolis, France",France,"Energy expenditure comes on average to 1,117 euros a year per household in collective dwellings and 1,481 euros in individual homes. Housing is the main energy consumer in the region (28% of final consumption) and the second sector for greenhouse gas emissions (22%) after that of transport.
Heating of living quarters counts for almost 2/3 of final energy consumption and ¾ of emission of greenhouse effect gases in the “housing” sector.
Reducing energy consumption in housing and the fight against energy precariousness are major objectives of Toulouse Métropole’s Territorial Climate Energy Plan (PCET). 
These are pursued through an un ambitious programme for rehabilitation of the social and private housing stock set at 2,500 dwellings rehabilitated a year and accompaniment and training of the inhabitants on energy and water saving behaviour alongside assistance measures to finance energy renovation works. 
To mobilise and accompany the region’s inhabitants, creating the Espace Info Énergie or EIE (Energy Information Centre) constitutes an essential action. The EIE advises and is there to raise the awareness of private individuals free of charge on the simple steps to be adopted and works to have done to optimise their energy consumption. They receive the general public through centres across the entire region or give out information by telephone or by correspondence. In total almost 4,000 people are informed each year by the EIE, 60% of whom actually act on the matter.
The “CoachCopro” operation was set up and launched in 2015. This is an Internet platform to accompany energy renovation by joint owners.
This provision is completed by other actions like the Bellefontaine show flat, creation of the Empalot solidarity workshop, the Médiaterre programme, the Mieux vivre chez soi (Better Living at Home) scheme and the climate innovation and solidarity fund.
The Mieux vivre chez soi scheme is a mission of support for the vulnerable to provide help improving the habitat of elderly and/or disabled people. This system helps conduct improvement works specific to disabilities, but also works generally related to living conditions, as with improved insulation and heating systems.
The MédiaTerre programme seeks to make consumers more responsible in terms of their consumption patterns and their impact on the environment. Volunteers in civic service go out to meet tenants in social housing, often affected by energy precariousness, to raise awareness, disseminate good practices and change sustainably the daily gestures of these people in difficulty via personalised accompaniment. This project also helps initiate and boost greater social cohesion in the neighbourhoods, especially via neighbourhood events and awareness booths.

Having noted that the Garonne and its banks, cornerstones to the local natural heritage, constitute a powerful lever to improve the quality of life and renew human contact with nature, Toulouse Métropole has devised a programme to make the most of this great asset aiming to create a Grand Parc Garonne to give a breath of fresh air to the entire Toulouse Metropolis.
The Grand Parc Garonne constitutes one of the major spaces for CO2 capture for the agglomeration and marks a moment of reconnection between the inhabitants and nature.
The Grand Parc will re-invest the banks of the Garonne and by 2020 it will connect up the whole 25 mile length stretching from the north to the south of the Metropolis. The Grand Parc concerns seven Toulouse Métropole towns over 3,000 hectares, thus giving the metropolis its “green lung”. This project seeks to develop soft modes of transport thanks to pedestrian and cycle paths and promote the natural heritage, fostering use of the waters, boating and nautical sports while also developing new spaces for cultural activities and conviviality.
To do this, itineraries, between 1 ½ and 6 miles long, allow hikers, cyclists and persons with reduced mobility, to discover the flora, the aquatic fauna, the Garonne area and the violet thanks to the many information boards at key points on the route. They also afford an opportunity to discover the neighbourhood, its history, its natural heritage and agriculture. Picnic areas and benches lie alongside the path so people can take a rest and make the most of the landscape, the fauna and the flora. 
Five other routes for pedestrians and cyclists will be created by 2017 on the Quinze Sols market gardening area.
100 years after the creation of the “Parc Toulousain”, the île du Ramier is again to become a place of greenery open to all, a huge area for relaxation and leisure activities, with games equipment, new sports activities, walks and educational gardens.

The Garonne drains a watershed covering about 10,000 km² which has the notable feature of being a steeply sloped corolla shaped basin. It thus tends to cause the concentration of already substantial flows of water coming from the direct or indirect tributaries of the Garonne, which takes its source in the Pyrenees.
The speeds at which the waters rise in the event of episodes of major flooding are of around 20 to 50 cm per hour. The time slot for prediction is short. 
The Garonne's history has been well chronicled so we can trace back to the biggest floods and better understand its behaviour.
The Garonne flood zone represents 15% of Toulouse's territory.
As it flows through the Metropolis, the river banks show many works conducted over the centuries. Quaysides and dykes now border the river.
In the present day, the dykes are real urban protection works against flooding, sized for the highest waters known, with this being a regular feature about every ten years. Other works like the channelling and deepening of the flood stage of the Garonne downstream of Bazacle, urbanisation and embankments in the flood plain and recalibration and control over the meanders on the contained River Hers and its tributaries.
The Toulouse agglomeration is identified as an area with high risk of flooding (Territoire à Risque Important d'Inondation or TRI). The aim of the flood prevention plan and the safeguard plan is to foresee and reduce negative consequences for human health, the environment, the natural heritage and economic activity associated with flooding in the Community.
In the event of a major natural or technological disaster, the population is warned by a siren as well as information provided by the municipal police. In order to ensure the dissemination of information and instructions in the event of an alert, agreements have been signed with various radio and TV media. In addition, the Metropolis has got equipped with a mass auto dialler to send out telephone messages, SMS, faxes and e-mails intended to inform citizens as quickly as possible of a major event to come or in process and the instructions to follow to stay safe. Inhabitants registered in the telephone directory are automatically brought into this provision.
An intervention plan has also been set up at the administrative level to ensure the creation of a team to protect people and property.
According to the levels of alert, this will generate the closure of watertight gates and installation of barriers, close sluice gates on the storm water drains and start up pumps. Closing off storm water allows the Garonne to be prevented from overflowing.",ACTION 17 – Adaptation – Flood risk plan - Toulouse Metropolis,,Completed,Policy/Strategies/Action Plans

To attain this objective, Terr’eau ciel arranges spaces for landscaping and offers events, conferences and training for all sections of the public targeting those who wish to get started or develop their knowledge of cultivation in an urban environment.
By re-investing urban spaces to develop vegetable garden landscaping, there is a real opportunity to renew the link between people and our common mother Earth.
The association was identified by the MACIF Foundation during the ""Talents Midi-Pyrénées"" competition for its initiatives in favour of good food and health.
It acts to reduce the costs of maintaining green areas and reducing waste via the creation of composting points, conducts training and opens the way to green professional skills. Beside the beauty of the garden replacing previously unoccupied space, the inhabitants can also make savings on their food bills and also cut out travel to the local supermarket. This initiative brings inhabitants together within a virtuous synergy of good practices both for eating habits and respect for the environment and education. 
The goal with these gardens is to use gardening themes to give a clearer idea of how the plant world works and raise awareness as to issues around biodiversity, responsible food, valorisation of the circular economy and short supply circuits, water and waste management.
Good waste management also means council taxes can be reduced.
The structure creates the urban food landscape then accompanies the inhabitants over the 2 years the project lasts.

1513,"Toulouse Metropolis, France",France,"Each year, the Metropolis invests in the Sustainable Development Week around fifty events to raise awareness, explain, open out to and involve the inhabitants in possible alternatives. This also provides the inhabitants with an opportunity to discover the more unusual places in the Metropolis that relate to sustainable development. Thus, each year the visit to the storm water network, waste water treatment stations, incineration sites and cycling excursions meets with considerable success. Fun workshops, demonstrations of good practices and conferences are also on the programme. The festive and friendly side is ensured by artists committed to the fight against climate change and turns the event into a festival for the climate and energy drawing in inhabitants from multiple horizons. 
This year, the event was sponsored and concluded by a conference on the climate bringing together experts like Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the IPCC (expert on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Joël Collado, French weather forecaster and columnist with France Radio.

1514,"Toulouse Metropolis, France",France,"The Garonne-Ariège Regional Nature Reserve is situated to the south of Toulouse and is recognised as being of European interest, also being Natura 2000 certified. The area is made up of flood plains and wet zones and represents a major ecological interest. Its great plant and animal diversity make it an essential element in water resource management. 
The wet zone is an area of transition between land and water, being among the richest and most complex natural environments in the world. The constant shift between running and stagnant water adds onto this a further variable. The regional reserve brings together conditions for life favourable to a wealth of plant and animal life.
243 plant species have been listed. Among others there is the white willow, alder, ash, several species of oak, yellow flag, bladderwort (a carnivorous plant!), etc. 
As for the fauna, compiling an exhaustive inventory would be a difficult matter - some animals are very secretive, some nocturnal and others migratory. There are the common genet, kingfisher, dragonfly, water flea, little egret, Mediterranean tree frog, grey heron and many others. The common kestrel and the eagle owl are happy there with the protection afforded by the cliffs. The eagle owl is listed as a “rare species” in the Red Book of birds that are under threat and to be monitored in France.
The wetlands acts as buffer zones absorbing water during floods and giving it back during droughts, which has a positive effect in helping to manage the risks of flooding and helping to keep the river flowing over the summer months. They also play a role in supplying groundwater.
Wet zones also work as a filter thanks to the sediments and the vegetation that physically trap toxic elements. They are involved in chemical processes relating to the interaction between the water, plants and solar radiation that transform pollutant matter and offer improved water quality.
The tree-lined banks of the great river provide a welcome stopover for migratory birds like the heron purple heron, the night heron or the black kite. Emblematic migrating fish like the Atlantic salmon or the allis shad (near extinction early in the 1980s) are gradually coming back to the Garonne thanks to the programmes to restore migrating fish. Their presence is an indicator as to the good quality of the aquatic environment.
In addition, this river corridor, covering about 600 hectares, offers a nature park in the immediate vicinity of the metropolis that is perfect for environmental education. The plant and animal life it brings together affords much of interest for visitors to learn about on the region, that nevertheless also remains an area of active agricultural production. Through its complexity and wealth of resources, the area of confluence between the Garonne and the Ariège, between water and land, makes for a tremendous terrain for experimentation to work on environmental education and an ideal vehicle to raise awareness on themes like the quality of water, biodiversity and sustainable development.",Water / Biodiversity – Garonne-Ariège Regional Nature Reserve - Toulouse Metropolis,,Completed,Technical/Infrastructure investment

Toulouse is mobilised over its metropolitan region but also at COP21.
1- In Paris, Toulouse Métropole will be presenting a film on Toulouse's innovative climatic solutions.
2- Toulouse Métropole's commitment also entails 110,000 euros of subsidies granted to associations to develop and support local initiatives on education about the environment and sustainable development. Thus, food, water, reducing waste, biodiversity and promoting green professions are considered of primary importance in the agglomeration. All of this also means material support to the associations, as for example to the Alternatiba group. This group, born from a spontaneous initiative from citizens, managed to bring together over a week-end more than a hundred associations concerned by sustainable development and the environment. More than 35,000 people crowded in to discover local initiatives, participatory workshops, demonstrations and conferences to seek a response to climate change. Meals shared together, fun animations, shows, concerts and artistic processions have made this event a popular festival with benevolent support from Toulouse Métropole.
3- Toulouse hosts the French Meteorology Centre. The “climate train”, initiated in Toulouse, has enabled researchers appointed for the occasion of “Climate Messengers” to go out and meet the population, run conferences and debates, present the issues and answer questions from the public. Toulouse Métropole has actively contributed to the train coming through the city and organised the train's stopover day with an exhibition put on by the “Climate Plan” team and a “Climate” stand around themes relating to sustainable mobility. This event met with great success, attracting many visitors and those curious to know who thus had the opportunity to discover the exhibition “The climate changes! So what do we change?” The eco-driving event allowed passers-by to be made more aware of responsible driving. Finally, a mobile street show put on by the  “Clowns pour Rire” troupe challenged passers-by at the station with humour on the theme of global warming.
4- The encounter with private enterprises at “1,2,3 Climat” also provides an opportunity for the local authority to award the prize for the Agil'T provision rewarding businesses committed to promoting Corporate Social Responsibility. This provision, set up in collaboration with the Toulouse Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Haute-Garonne Chamber of Trades and Crafts, accompanies small and medium enterprises in organising, evaluating and promoting their CSR approach. 
5- The “Citizens' Forum for the Climate” will allow Toulouse inhabitants to express their views and present their initiatives, ideas and wishes this coming 20th of November.

1516,"Toulouse Metropolis, France",France,"Toulouse Métropole now has 2 out of the 19 French eco-neighbourhoods recognised in 2014, with Vidailhan and Andromède. Other eco-neighbourhoods are now being built as with the Cartoucherie right in the centre of Toulouse.
Andromède constitutes the first eco-neighbourhood introduced by Toulouse Métropole. It is situated over the towns of Blagnac and Beauzelle, at the heart of the Aéroconstellation structuring project. The neighbourhood was thought out in an innovative manner while also preserving the characteristics of the suburb and the garden city that are rooted in the landscape and the memory of the site.
The neighbourhood answers to the requirements adhered to by Toulouse Métropole in terms of social and intergenerational diversity. 4,000 housing units are now planned for over a surface area of 209 hectares. There will be a lycée, sports complex, crèche, leisure centre, home for young workers, gendarmerie and local traders so the inhabitants and employees on the site can get a first taste of life in a neighbourhood.
Quality of life is one of the objectives of the pilot project in the fields of water management, soft mode travel and ecoconstruction. Andromède really favours the natural spaces present over more than a third of its surface area. Five green spaces crossed though by a green belt already have 5,000 trees. Andromède can be reached by line 1 of the tramway linking to line A of the Toulouse metro. There are now almost 10 miles of cycle tracks available to residents. 
Balma Vidailhan:
Combining the urban and the human - that's the stated ambition of the Vidailhan eco-neighbourhood in Balma.
Located half way between the metro station and Balma town centre, the Vidailhan eco-neighbourhood creates a link between the future tertiary campus to the north, the residential quarters to the east and the commercial area. The fact that it is close to the Toulouse ring road, is provided with a cycle path and is also in easy distance of the metro and bus terminus makes the neighbourhood readily accessible. On completion, some 1,750 dwellings at affordable prices and 200,000 m2 of office space will make up this neighbourhood covering 106 hectares. 
Life takes on a village air over this urban area that combines extremely varied forms of habitat: duplexes with large patios on the roof, terraced houses with small gardens or more conventional blocks of flats. In the middle of the common gardens onto which these dwellings look out, the inhabitants will enjoy the calm and the originality of the site.
In 2011, the Vidailhan eco-neighbourhood received the “Quality of project for neighbourhood life” prize. What won the award were the anticipation of a neighbourhood life style based on diversity, social cohesion and eco-commitment, but also a project set-up and implementation based on participation, partnership and sustained political support. 
With 25% of social housing, a school, services and a heat plant unique to France using 80% renewable energy, combining wood burning, solar energy and gas, Vidailhan has all it takes to please.",ACTION 12 – Labelled eco-neighbourhoods - Toulouse Metropolis,,Completed,Technical/Infrastructure investment
1517,"Toulouse Metropolis, France",France,"Toulouse Métropole wishes to restore biodiversity over its region. To do so, there is a need to create in the urban environment a state of equilibrium, combining meadows and hedgerows to mark out the landscape with masses of greenery, combining trees, bushes and shrubs and reforestation.
The Toulouse Métropole area is endowed with many natural habitats and the presence of nature in the City itself as along the banks of the Garonne and other waterways, canals, the southern Toulouse hillsides, meadowland, green areas, parks and gardens. Aware of these advantages, the Metropolis has initiated actions and framework documents to help preserve that natural wealth. Indeed, the City of Toulouse was awarded the Silver Dragonfly distinction in 2011 at the French Biodiversity Capital competition, in the major cities category.
* Acquisition of knowledge: inventory of fauna and flora on 19 sites in 2014 and creation of a naturalists’ database shared by the main naturalist players in the region 
* A fauna and flora warning tool, connected up with the naturalists database, to warn the urban services as soon as a project is located in a sensitive area, with the aim of integrating biodiversity upstream 
* Consideration for biodiversity in city planning, in specific projects and within a general reference framework for sustainable development in process of finalisation. 
* Nature strand in the city in Toulouse Local City Planning
* Green and blue infrastructure appended to the Concerted Territorial Planning Scheme (SCOT)
* Adhesion to the Midi-Pyrénées Region Regional Biodiversity Observatory
* Drawing up of a strategy in favour of biodiversity over the area of the Metropolis with, in particular, a project on participatory sciences: Garden Butterfly Observatory, installation of bee hives and insect reserves in public space and a nature discovery park 
* Development of a community garden policy in the City of Toulouse 
* Consideration for biodiversity in framework documents for the Metropolis: Climate Energy Plan, statement of works for sustainable agriculture in the suburban area, statement of works for the landscape and the environment
* Acquisition of wet zones for them to be managed as conservation areas 
* Publication of a work on the wealth of fauna and flora in Toulouse
* “Differentiated” management involving analysing the functions of each site in order to adopt the practices adapted to users’ needs with the aim of reconciling human uses and respect for the environment. The issue is one of reconstituting functional ecosystems. The most striking example is with the installation of urban meadowland alongside roads, in the middle of parks or in green areas.
* Mindful consumption of natural resources, starting with water. In addition to avoiding untimely irrigation, this means limiting evaporation (night-time irrigation, mulching around trees, etc.) and favouring the plantation of rustic plants requiring little water. 
* Limiting the risk of pollution with the zero pesticide plan.",Biodiversity – Toulouse Métropole's commitments to foster biodiversity  - Toulouse Metropolis,,In operation,Policy/Strategies/Action Plans

1565,"Municipality of Villa Nueva, Guatemala",Guatemala,"Between 2012 and 2013, the Municipality of Villa Nueva collected about 36.7 million quetzales through the Municipal Public Lighting Rate. However, in the same period, had paid 39 million quetzales by the electricity consumption of the lamps of the park network service.
In addition to the 4 million quetzales of difference between the energy consumed and the rate collected, the commune also paid 3.5 million quetzales in maintenance services to the network, in addition to other administrative expenses related to the service.
Even after these expenses, where the service was subsidized by more than 7 million quetzales per year, the quality and service continuity of the existing 16,286 lamps was constantly interrupted due to the inefficiency of existing lighting technology, Traffic, poor quality of the electrical fluid and other factors that caused the network to maintain more than 20% of the lamps turned off.
This situation caused annoyance to the neighbors due to the increase of the violence, the difficulty to transit at night and the existence of an inefficient service regarding the payment of taxes and the expected service.
As a result, the urgent need to modernize the service network park with new lamps of highly efficient technology was determined. This meant an investment of more than 100 million quetzales which could not be assumed by the Municipality at that time.
Once the problems and the solution were identified, the different alternatives that within the legal framework of the country were analyzed and the capacities of the Municipality could be viable. After this analysis, it was determined that awarding the service was the most appropriate option to achieve, through a public-private partnership.
This concession would consist of granting a company the complete management of the service, with the premise that, in order to achieve efficiency and profitability, it should completely replace the range of lamps in the network with lamps with high energy efficiency, light and long quality useful life.
After a national and international tender competition, the service administration was granted a Guatemalan company with technology from Israel.
From then on and under defined quality of service standards, the company made the total change of the 16,286 mercury vapor lamps and gave high pressure by new LED lamps, both in the downtown of the same as in the suburbs and villages.
After the replacement of luminaires in 2016, the results of the project have been highly visible and can be summarized as follows: 1) Reduction of 70% of energy consumption in the lamps. 2) Reduction of the heat production in the devices. 3) Improvements in lighting levels of streets, parks and other public spaces. 4) Reduction of delinquency points and areas of traffic accidents. 5) Service with less than 1% of faults.

Rajkot lies within the watershed expansion of Aji river basin and it is a network of 19 natural drainage courses, locally known as vokdas. Unfortunately, these vokdas are being used for sewage and solid waste disposal which has led to environmental degradation of the same. Water supply depends in the first months after the monsoon to a certain degree on local water supply sources. 90% of total water supply of city is depending on Narmada water, which is sourced from 700 km away from the city and consumes huge electricity. Soil stratum in Rajkot region consists of hard rock. Moreover, the confined aquifer layer is thin. Hence, the availability of ground water for potable use in Rajkot is limited. Catchment area management and measures for aquifer recharge are potential solutions to this problem. The study thus seeks to identify the potential for augmenting the availability of local water resources.  Based on the allowable water abstraction, the city’s reliance on Narmada water may also reduce. Local aquifer recharge and an improvement in the ground water situation are desired outcomes.  Treatment of wastewater for reuse is also essential and will help to address water scarcity, particularly in the dry months and will also help to reduce the pressure on the declining ground water resource.

In addition, the Structural Plan provides for a substantial redevelopment of the existing building stock, also significantly improving its energy and environmental performance.
An additional support action will involve heating systems, which will be required to meet increased minimum standards, gradually achieving total energy efficiency for the sector by 2020.",zero volumes - Metropolitan City of Florence,2011,In operation,Regulatory
2084,"Metropolitan City of Florence, Italy",Italy,"To achieve the predefined objectives of the Plan, it is extremely critical, in practical terms, to be an active part of the Plan itself, to foster the active involvement of every level of local stakeholder and the population at large (an essential component for achieving reductions in CO2 emissions) and to stimulate research and raise the awareness of participating enterprises and other units in the territory so that they can cooperate harmoniously to achieve this fundamental goal for the city.
From the perspective of active implementation, which describes how the current administration adopts all of its Plans (beginning with the Structural Plan, which used the Town Meeting instrument to ensure maximum transparency and active citizen participation), the communication plan was created on the basis of two primary tools:
non-stop institutional communication: a dedicated space was opened on the public municipal network (located under Administration - Plans and projects) where all information and updates can be accessed at any time (the SEAP page) direct participation: via scheduled meetings aimed at specific actors and opened to the entire population.
The reduction of CO2 emissions needs to be a common, shared goal that extends across the entire territory and involves every sector - this is the assumption underlying the communications plan, which is pervaded by the notion that the process must take place before, during and after the SEAP itself is approved. 
Participation is an indispensable condition for the city's sustainable development, which means that sufficient communication of the SEAP objectives is as fundamental as the sharing of the city's future with other institutions, local actors and the citizens. The Administration, therefore, has opened a dialog with different subjects in the worlds of business, scientific research, labor unions, associations, representatives of production categories and the world of associationism more generally in order to cultivate these themes with a variety of different means and methods. 
The basic structure of communication and involvement, as a result, has been organized into three main phases:
pre: presentation of the draft Action Plan for Sustainable Energy and opening of a discussion designed to gather suggestions and proposals for initiating collaboration improving on operational aspects of existing collaborations 
post: presentation of the Sustainable Energy Action Plan, as approved by the City Executive and the City Council
on-going: periodical meetings for updates in correspondence with monitoring sessions 
Phase 1: presentation of the SEAP (Sustainable Energy Action Plan)
Phase 1 is the only part of the prepared plan that has been implemented so far.
In the interest of recruiting the largest number of interested subjects, public and sector-based meetings have been scheduled in correspondence with internationally-known and sector-based fairs that take place in the territory (Terrafutura, for instance).","communication plan ""100 squares"" - Metropolitan City of Florence",2008,In operation,Education/Awareness Raising

The public sector, despite accounting for a small percentage of the overall municipal energy balance, nonetheless has the duty of implementing all possible energy efficiency measures in order to reduce consumption and costs.
By implementing a series of integrated actions, the City will be able to achieve European-level best practices and act as a leading example for the city’s residents.
Specifically, measures for redeveloping schools, public offices, sports facilities and cultural buildings have been set out. These interventions will consist mainly of converting heating systems to natural gas and optimizing their efficiency in addition to the widespread use of renewable energy sources (solar thermal, photovoltaic, micro-wind), where urban planning restrictions allow.
Public Residential Construction, which has already embarked on a path of excellence with the building of innovative projects on a national scale, may provide substantial support for energy-saving policies, while at the same time improving the quality of service offered to users.
The health sector, which has a significant presence in the municipal area with several centres of medical excellence, is undergoing a period of structural modernization that has involved and will involve the aspect of energy production in all of its forms (cogeneration, solar thermal, photovoltaic, energy saving) by reducing energy requirements and increasing energy supply security. 
All of the lighting equipment managed by the Municipality (public street lighting, traffic lights, votive lamps) will also undergo significant modernization in order to help reduce municipal electricity consumption, while tree planting in the city streets will be used to limit temperature variations.
Even the most Florentine of features, the River Arno, an inescapable feature of the municipal landscape, will contribute to the Action Plan, thanks to 5 micro-hydro plants planned to be put in place at the existing dikes.
Pending being able to establish the possibility of applying energy accounting procedures to the efforts made by the local administration, in cooperation with neighboring municipalities, in the waste sector (which have not yet been included as they are of supra-municipal interest), the energy/environmental policy lines effectively concern all of the municipal administration’s activities, multiplying the results of the specific actions described, thanks to green public procurement, which institutionalizes attention to environmental externalities in procurement and purchasing procedures, which until now have been down to individual sensitivity.",public properties impact reduction - Metropolitan City of Florence,2005,In operation,Policy/Strategies/Action Plans
2086,"Metropolitan City of Florence, Italy",Italy,"The transport sector has the largest impact, with 0.88 Mt/year of CO2 emitted, 34.5% of the total. What is required is a substantial, integrated action which makes it possible – even in a difficult situation such as that of urban Florence, congested as it is by commuter and tourist flows – to achieve a significant reduction in the environmental impact of mobility in the context of the city.
In the light of the complexity of the sector and the major impact that transport has on both air quality and citizens’ quality of life, the plan envisages a well-defined series of actions that involve both the framework program and the creation of important infrastructure for the city.
On the basis of the policies and recommendations of the Structural Plan, priority interventions have been identified, such as access to zones of the city (e.g. pedestrianisation, limited traffic zones, eco-road pricing policies), the planning of parking areas and charging systems (Parking Plan with the creation of park-and-ride car parks) in addition to directly and indirectly promoting the technological modernization of vehicles in circulation.
Connected with this overall action is the creation of an ever wider network of cycle paths/lanes and the possibility of setting up a bike sharing service that can integrate with available public transport and that is aimed not only at residents but also the millions of tourists that visit the city every year.
A significant contribution to improving the availability of public transport is represented by the construction of tram lines (line 1, already completed, lines 2 and 3 and extensions) with the capacity of attracting substantial mobility flows bound for the city centre; this intervention requires several support measures, including creating park-and-ride car parks, optimizing the strategy of integrated transport, and improving information accessibility (Wi-Fi and Web 2.0 on board).
City traffic, which will be partly eased by the abovementioned actions, will be subject to traffic-flow-easing measures through the creation of a modern traffic management centre capable of providing real-time information regarding critical traffic situations and alternatives, linked to the existing information portal accessible to the public (the web-based TO-GO portal and updatable message panels).
Both the municipal vehicle fleet and public transport will undergo technological modernization and it will be possible to trial the use of electric vehicles for private mobility which, especially in certain central zones, will be able to help reduce the impact of emissions in terms of greenhouse gases (they will be powered by recharging stations supplying certified green energy) and the noise aspect.",comprehensive mobility - Metropolitan City of Florence,2004,In operation,Policy/Strategies/Action Plans

2254,"Hang Tuah Jaya Municipal Council, Malaysia",Malaysia,"Green Technology Application for the development of Low Carbon Cities (GTALCC) project is to support Malaysia’s aspiration of promoting low carbon development in the cities (hence low carbon cities), reduce carbon emissions in the city envelop and eventually contribute towards the national commitment as pledge by the Prime Minister during the COP15 where Malaysia is committed to reducing up to 40% of Green House Gasses (GHGs) in terms of emission intensity by GDP by the year 2020 (compared to 2005 levels) conditional upon financing and transfer of technology by the developed countries.  GTALCC aspires to achieve the following outcomes by the end of the 5-year project period:
Major cities implemented and adopted integrated low carbon urban development plans and /or programs;
Expedient appraisal, approval and implementation of strategic urban development plans/program and projects related to the wide spread development of low carbon cities;
Major cities are aware of, and are planning and implementing low carbon technology applications for integrated urban development;
Increased investment in low carbon technology applications in cities;
More low carbon urban infrastructure projects implemented in Malaysian cities;
The proposed project is in line with the GEF 5 Strategic Objective CCM 4 on the promotion of energy efficient low carbon transport and urban systems. It consists of interventions across cities in Malaysia to facilitate the implementation of low carbon initiatives and showcase a clear and integrated approach of successful low carbon city development.  In general, cities are a key contributor of GHG emissions with an estimated 70% of the world’s energy related emissions. In Malaysia, more than half of total emissions are related to urban spaces—specifically, electricity (up to 26% of the emissions), transportation (16%) and solid waste (12%). Recognizing that cities are natural partners to chart a low carbon growth path the Government of Malaysia has recently launched the Low Carbon Cities Framework and Assessment (LCCF). The objective is to achieve sustainable development, reduce carbon emissions of the cities and contribute towards the national commitment of reducing up to 40% of GHGs in terms of emission intensity by GDP by the year 2020 compared to 2005 levels.  Currently, several low carbon city initiatives which explicitly target low carbon development are at various stages of development at the national and subnational levels. However, the initiatives are developing in a rather fragmented manner without a common shared vision, integrated approach to low carbon development, agreed definitions or well accepted methodologies and standards.

EPCert not just only stimulating green development in Melaka, but also promoting green economy to achieve the Green City Action Plan (GCAP) target. This initiative scheme was conducted through identifying the buildings energy performance and additionally will propose a rating and labeling individual buildings. Plus, the evaluation process will also include the users’ satisfaction level and their building’s functionality.
Established in October 2016, the EPCert scheme targets on non-residential building and will be inflate to residential buildings in future. The pilot scheme operated on a voluntary basis and will be widely used by the local government buildings in Melaka. This scheme evaluates three basic principles such as Building Energy Index (BEI), building’s characteristics and organisation’s commitments. This will rates building energy efficiency by practicing grades from seven flowers icon to one flowers icon that also known as 7-Flowers rated (‘seven flowers icon’ is the most efficient grade). In present, the certification validity period is only valid for three years and will be required to disclose during the buying or the rental process to give information (building energy performance data) to the prospective buyers or tenants.
Viewing the fact that lots of building users were not consuming energy efficiently, EPCert has planned to make sure that they will review their energy consumption and offering the top managements or building owners in every organization on the monitoring process regarding buildings energy performance. It also offers a mechanism towards prospective buyers and tenants by comparing the energy efficiency of different buildings or the energy rating across a range of similar buildings. To date, there are nine major government buildings in Melaka that had joined this programme ; Melaka Historic City Council one of the building has been audited and certified in this program. They had been audited from November 2016 until May 2017.

This Waste Eco Park consists of a recycling centre where the people of Melaka can separate their waste accordingly. Besides that, this project is also using an advanced form of technology which is the Aerobic landfill technology. It allows the flow of air through the leachate collection pipes located at the bottom of the landfill , which helps to enlarge aerobic decomposition and invigorate the bacteria to accelerate the decomposition process. Through these combined set of measures, the water quality of leachate is expected to improve since the leachate concentrate is reduced thus inhibiting the production of harmful gases and stabilizing the landfill process. This project is designed for efficient solid waste management with a capacity to accommodate 1,200 tons per day. 
At the same time, it must be noted that Melaka is one of the 6 states in Malaysia which seeks to segregate waste at domestic level. Consequently, as a preparatory measure, all councils in Melaka have introduced the “2 + 1 Municipal Waste” collection system from the previous collection system of 3 times a week. It was first introduced by Solid Waste Corp in 2013 whereby organic and unrecyclable 
waste are collected twice a week. In the meantime, recyclable waste such as plastic, paper, etc will be collected once a week. 
Similarly, Melaka has also implemented No Plastic Day on Saturday since 1 Jan 2011. Among the objectives to promote the recycling mentality among Melaka residents whereby they remember to bring their own bag from home for grocery purchases.

• The use of electric buses is being made a reality within Petaling Jaya with the intention of  reducing the carbon footprint of the city.  As part of an agreement between Prasarana (Malaysian Public Bus Service provider) and MBPJ , the council has expanded its fleet of free public buses to include 1 electric bus equipped with wi-fi. 
• At the same time, MBPJ has bought 20 electric motorcycles for the use of its staff to provide community services to the residents of Petaling Jaya. 
• MBPJ had established various cycling paths and walkways for pedestrians to use. This is an extenstion of the eco-mobility concept highlighted in Petaling Jaya’s list of sustainable actions undertaken last year. All Free bus service stops are to be integrated within a 400 m radius of walking and cycling routes made safe for the public. Consequently, the bycycle paths are about 56 kilometres long and conjoined with bus shelters along Light Rail Transit stations, commuter stations and major destinations for public amenities. 
• Apart of the electric charging station at MBPJ reported in last year’s EHCC submission, MBPJ has also faciliated the setting up of electric charging facilities at Jaya One shopping complex, Nissan car showroom and the upcoming Pinacle office tower near Hotel Armada.  
• Based on trust, the council also provides annual property tax rebates to residents who claim that they are able to fullfill any one of 6 environmental qualification aspects including commuting via  public transport as part of their daily routine",Sustainable Transport Systems including Electric Vehicles  - Petaling Jaya City Council,,In operation,Policy/Strategies/Action Plans
2346,"Petaling Jaya City Council, Malaysia",Malaysia,"NEW developments, be it commercial or residential regardless of scale, type and geographical location must fulfil a list of green criteria set by the Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ) before the planning permission is given. All developments including semi-detached structures and bungalows will have to be fitted with a rainwater harvesting system and maintain a minimum of 10% total land area as green open space.
Meanwhile, new commercial and mixed commercial developments will have to fulfil five criteria: - 
• Installation a rainwater harvesting system
• green building index (GBI) compliance
• use of light emitting diode (LED) lamps
• eco-friendly development manual (Masma) specifications 
• landscape area of about 10% to 15% out of their total development area.
MBPJ is the only local authority to have actually made the installation of rainwater systems and LED lighting within building plans as mandatory rather than voluntary. Another key initiative of the council is the promotion of housing insulation together with the Malaysian Insulation Manufactuers Group (MIMG) . The intention is to promote insulation as energy efficient material to reduce infiltration of sunlight and atmospheric heat into Malaysian buildings. Subsequently, the building owner would enjoy lower energy consumption and energy costs. As part of a corporate social responsibility initiative, the MIMG group has offered to install these insulation materials in 4 houses for free to prove and demonstrate the reliability of the materials to Petaling Jaya residents. The pilot project is expected to commence in January 2016 with the assistance of the council within Kampung Kayu Ara village. 
Green Requirements 
• Rainwater Harvesting System 
• Applicants for new developments will be required to install a rainwater harvesting system according to guidelines set by the Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government Ministry. This comes under the ministry’s Guidelines for Installing A Rainwater Collection and Utilisation System. Developments include bungalows, semi-detached structures, apartments, condominiums, commercial units and even mixed development units. Between 2010 and 2011, MBPJ received 418 applicants, while there were 117 applications in 2012 and 93 as of September 2013. MBPJ is the only local authority to have actually made the installation of rainwater systems as mandatory rather than voluntary
• Green Building Index (GBI), an accreditation scheme in Malaysia
• New developments will have to adhere or meet the requirements of the green building standards. In other words, buildings have to meet the criteria on energy and water efficiency.This is to be reflected in the building plans submitted to the city council. For example, using materials such as LED lights, efficient energy usage through solar panelling or even sufficient windows where sunlight can come through. Applicants have to submit this together with the building plans and not after the final reports. Projects approved in accordance with the GBI were 61 for 2010 to 2011, 16 for 2012 and 13 between January and September 2013. This GBI requirement, however, is only required for bigger-scaled developments like commercial units or mixed developments. In addition, developers are also required to include a landscape area of about 10% to 15% in their projects. This space will have to be free from utilities and other structures and set aside for landscaping.

• Green Rebates
• Open to 100,000 households in the city, homeowners are urged to go green and stand a chance to get an assessment rebate of up to 100%. The value of the rebate will be determined by six criteria such as energy, water, transport, compost, biodiversity and other green initiatives they may have. For example, cultivate a garden in the house or participate in recycling activities. Owners of semi-D’s, terrace, bungalows, apartments, condominiums and flats are eligible.  Applicants will need to present their application form along with a copy of their latest assessment bill, electricity bill, water bill and myKad. Homeowners who have received the rebate will be required to reapply for the following year. They will also be required to take on more green initiatives. In 2011, only 50 applied, with 49 eligible to participate and 13 receiving a 100% rebate. Meanwhile in 2012, 83 applied, 65 were eligible and 15 received a 100% assessment rebate.

2347,"Petaling Jaya City Council, Malaysia",Malaysia,"Petaling Jaya has been identified as one of the key cities to be targeted under the GTALCC project and subsequent implementation of the Low Carbon City Framework. The Green Technology Application for the development of Low Carbon Cities (GTALCC) project is to support Malaysia’s aspiration of promoting low carbon development in the cities (hence low carbon cities), reduce carbon emissions in the city envelop and eventually contribute towards the national commitment as pledge by the Prime Minister during the COP15 where Malaysia is committed to reducing up to 40% of Green House Gasses (GHGs) in terms of emission intensity by GDP by the year 2020 (compared to 2005 levels) conditional upon financing and transfer of technology by the developed countries. 
GTALCC aspires to achieve the following outcomes by the end of the 5-year project period: 
• Major cities implemented and adopted integrated low carbon urban development plans and /or programs; 
• Expedient appraisal, approval and implementation of strategic urban development plans/program and projects related to the wide spread development of low carbon cities; 
• Major cities are aware of, and are planning and implementing low carbon technology applications for integrated urban development; 
• Increased investment in low carbon technology applications in cities; 
• More low carbon urban infrastructure projects implemented in Malaysian cities; 
The proposed project is in line with the GEF 5 Strategic Objective CCM 4 on the promotion of energy efficient low carbon transport and urban systems. It consists of interventions across cities in Malaysia to facilitate the implementation of low carbon initiatives and showcase a clear and integrated approach of successful low carbon city development. In general, cities are a key contributor of GHG emissions with an estimated 70% of the world’s energy related emissions. In Malaysia, more than half of total emissions are related to urban spaces—specifically, electricity (up to 26% of the emissions), transportation (16%) and solid waste (12%). 
Recognizing that cities are natural partners to chart a low carbon growth path the Government of Malaysia has launched the Low Carbon Cities Framework and Assessment (LCCF). The objective is to achieve sustainable development, reduce carbon emissions of the cities and contribute towards the national commitment of reducing up to 40% of GHGs in terms of emission intensity by GDP by the year 2020 compared to 2005 levels. 
Currently, several low carbon city initiatives which explicitly target low carbon development are at various stages of development at the national and subnational levels. However, the initiatives are developing in a rather fragmented manner without a common shared vision, integrated approach to low carbon development, agreed definitions or well accepted methodologies and standards. As such, a full scale project is proposed in the PIF, which focuses on the removal of barriers pertaining to policy and regulatory; financing issues; awareness, technical and institutional capacity through the three (3) components: -
• Component 1: Policy support for the promotion of integrated low carbon urban development
• Component 2: Awareness and institutional capacity development
• Component 3: Low carbon technology investments in cities",Petaling Jaya as Host City for UNDP GTALCC project.  - Petaling Jaya City Council,,In operation,Policy/Strategies/Action Plans

The new innovative approach by the council to turn biodegradable waste into cooking gas, gives hope that food waste may have a better future than rotting at landfills and producing harmful greenhouse gases.
Organics and other food scraps have long been just part of MBPJ’s trash pile but this pilot programme “Waste to Wealth”, in collaboration with CH Green Company, allows a smarter choice for organic waste disposal. By using the mobile anaerobic digester machine, there have been many benefits as it has helped to reduce the amount of trash going to landfills and also curbs transport costs.
Diesel costs and carbon emissions have also  been reduced thus mitigating the council’s expenditure costs. Lifespan of landfills may also be extended. Similarly, the generated compost may be also used as fertilizer material.

2350,"Petaling Jaya City Council, Malaysia",Malaysia,"With the recent formation of solid waste management department within Petaling Jaya city Council, the Council is embarking on an era of environmental good governance within its waste management and public cleanliness activities. Activities of good governance in this activity include: - 
a) Waste management sharing concept
Residents of high-rises in Petaling Jaya would no longer need to hire their own waste management contractors as the Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ) will be picking up the tab in 2015.  MBPJ would first calculate an estimated amount of waste produced per unit in a high-rise development and then multiply it with the number of units there to create a bench mark. If residents of the high-rise development were to produce less waste than expected, the money saved from reduced collection fees will be split evenly between MBPJ and the building's Joint Management Body (JMB). Subsequently, the fees will be borne by MBPJ if the amount collected is the same as the estimated amount, but cautioned that if the collected waste exceeded the estimated amount, the JMB will have to pay the extra charges. This would be a form of incentive for people to reduce, reuse, and recycle (3R) so they will not produce waste unnecessarily and excessively in parallel with the concept of polluters pay.
b) At the same time, Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ) implemented a new complaint management and solving programme to better manage and solve complaints from residents and council members. Under its Councillor Neighbourhood Ambassador (CNA) programme, MBPJ will initially select three zones with one MBPJ officer appointed to each zone to monitor and manage all the complaints within that zone. 
c) Implementation of guidelines being drawn up by MBPJ to regulate blossoming food truck business where the food truck owners do not dispose of their waste products efficiently. 
d) A new rubbish collection system initiated by the Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ) at Kampung Baru Seri Setia that began in November has proven successful and effective.  The council implemented a central deposit system where it identified and designated rubbish sites at intersections around the village to reduce unnecessary trips the trucks needed to make. Subsequently, the council would reduce mileage costs along with CO2 emissions. 
e) Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ) implemented a three-month pilot project called the Mobile Waste Transfer Station at Section 5, Petaling Jaya, to increase waste disposal effectiveness in the area. A 10 tonne capacity Roll-On and Roll-Off (RoRo) bin will be placed at Jalan 5/2 as the Council have already received permission of the residents and the site was chosen due to its strategic open space location to accommodate the accessibility of trucks. The bin will be placed from 8:30am until 4:30pm every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday weekly, to store garden and bulk waste collected throughout the neighbourhood of Section 5. The Council feel that this initiative is aimed at increasing productivity of rubbish collection service by reducing trips taken to the landfill, transportation cost and manpower needed
f) Elimination of problem of illegal banners by year-end in collaboration with waste disposal contractors in accordance with the City Beautification Committee of MBPJ
g) Establishing the online and real time communication platform at respective neighbourhood area with the participation of Council staff, residents’ representatives, council member, contractors and elected members of state legislative council.  The digital medium allows dissemination of information regarding work schedules of contractors, any emergency disruption on services rendered, complaints lodged by residents, announcement by the Council.  This method has managed to reduce the number of complaints and to shorten response time taken to rectify flaw in services.
h) Introducing concept of shared responsibility amongst the small traders at SS2, SS3 and Section 20 night market.  The market would be closed for a day if more than 30% of the total number of traders committed offences in relations to rubbish and cleanliness at public area.  This has improved the level of cleanliness at trading area tremendously because the traders started to keep an eye on the behavior of their fellow traders.        
i) A pilot project on waste separation involving 660 household has been started since end of September.  The project aims at encouraging recycling at source has resulted reduction on waste collected.  It is hope that lessons learned would help the Council to roll out the city-wide waste separation requirement by all households by end of November.

The City has been implementing energy efficiency retrofit programmes within municipal operations since 2009, covering traffic lights, street lights, buildings and wastewater treatment plant retrofits. Rooftop solar photovoltaic systems are also installed where possible. The programme includes energy management training for facilities staff, behaviour change programmes for building users and smart driver training for the City’s fleet drivers.   An extensive data management system has been developed which aligns location, metering and billing data from smart meters and administrative systems – the overall data feeds through to managers, and the specific data to staff on the ground to improve building management.  All of these activities fall under the Internal Resource Management Protocol which sets out a comprehensive plan for improved resource management across all departments.    Savings and progress are reported annually to the City’s Finance Department. 
All contracting is based on performance guaranteed tendering – this is an innovative approach developed by the City of Cape Town to fit with the requirements of the South African Municipal Finance Management Act and with the type of funding which can be accessed by municipalities  – this approach is  now being used by other municipalities in South Africa.  The programme is funded by national government grants and by the City’s budget.  Independent monitoring and evaluation is conducted on all projects.  
From 2009 to 2016 the programme saved over 102 000 MWh, which translates into savings of R 180 million ($ 12.6million) and 101 000 metric tonnes CO2e.
Some examples include:
• All traffic lights and more than 17% of street lights in Cape Town have been retrofitted with LEDs.
• 57% of the City’s buildings have been retrofitted, including 40 large administrative buildings. Energy efficiency improvements not only reduce costs, but also improve the quality of the working environment.
• Smart electricity meters have been installed which has greatly improved the City’s electricity use management.

The Kuyasa Project was a pilot project that involved the installation of solar water heaters, insulated ceilings and efficient lighting in 2300 households. It became Africa's first registered Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project and was awarded the Gold Standard. This project aimed to improve thermal efficiency of houses, decrease  emissions, and lower monthly fuel bills to create a better living environment, improve indoor air quality and therefore minimising health problems. It became Africa's first registered Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project and was awarded the Gold Standard. The project was also awarded joint third place in Point Carbon's Best CDM Project 2004 Competition at the Carbon Market Insights Conference in Amsterdam. It also received a Platinum Impumelelo Award in 2010. 
The aim of the Mamre Ceilings Pilot Project was to improve the thermal efficiency of houses, decreasing energy consumption and emissions, therefore lowering monthly electricity bills to create a better living environment and improving indoor air quality. The pilot project created local employment to people who learned new skills by assisting in the installation of ceilings in their homes. The Mamre Ceilings Project was driven by the City's Environmental Resource Management Department as part of the Danish Development Aid funded Urban Environmental Management Programme. 230 houses benefitted from this pilot project. The new ceilings helped residents cut down on heating and cooling costs and improved their quality of life. An insulated ceiling is the single most important energy related upgrade that  can improve  the quality of life of many people, reduce their energy costs and combat health problems caused by damp and mould as a result of poor insulation. The project is now complete and created jobs for 18 unemployed people. The project benefitted the vulnerable groups within the community such as the elderly, unemployed, chronically ill, disabled people with dependants, child-headed households and single parent households. The City is currently researching the impact of the ceilings retrofit project  in order to present a business case for ceilings retrofits in RDP (Reconstruction Development Programme) houses still lacking ceilings.

The baseline situation is that passengers would use conventional modes of transport including buses, minibus-taxis, cars, suburban train, motorcycles and Non-Motorized Transport thus causing baseline trip emissions in absence of the project. Project emissions are based on the actual fuel consumption of buses forming part of the project. Leakage emissions are caused by changes of congestion and speed resulting potentially in a rebound and a speed effect plus potential change of load factors of remaining buses and minibus-taxis in the city. Emission reductions are the result of reduced GHG (Greenhouse Gases) emissions per passenger trip comparing the baseline with the project situation.The BRT Rea Vaya is also earning voluntary carbon standard whilst reducing GHG emissions by improving the resource efficiency of transporting passengers.A crucial element of the Rea Vaya project is the reduction of Joburg’s public transport carbon footprint. The fleet for the first phase had Euro IV emission standards with particle filter while the second fleet meets Euro V standards. It is envisaged that the bus fleets for future phases will be powered by a combination of biogas and diesel.

• Renewable Energy, Energy efficiency, Demand side management and storage technologies (decreasing
traditional kWh sales from utility)
• Customers are getting smarter (behind the meter initiatives) such as smart mini-grids, storage and
embedded generation enabling disconnection from the grid
• Financial changes such as reduced technology costs and reduced financing costs (more affluent customers
can choose alternatives due to financial considerations eg rooftop solar PV)
• Enabling policy such as Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency policies and subsidies (external influences
impacting on kWh business of municipality)
• Tax incentives such as the Section 12B, K and L for efficiencies and renewables
• Many of these are currently not yet reducing the required network capacity
• This has and will result in many non-utility players entering the market creating new competition and a risk of
stranded assets for utilities
• The distributed generation and renewable energy will introduce variability into the network where a safe, reliable
and clean supply of electricity is a key pre-condition for sustainability and economic prosperity
Some of the challenges with municipalities becoming generators include:
• The definition of an IPP in the new NGR and MSA effectively means that local government cannot hold a
direct or indirect controlling interest in an IPP
• In addition currently municipalities do not have the ‘competency’ as a generator of electricity
• The reduction in energy tariff and the need to assess tariff structures based on leased lines and networks
• Safety concerns from embedded generation
• Current poorly formulated policy to deal with embedded generation
• All, if not most of these items need to be addressed in order for municipality’s to embrace opportunities and
minimise potential threats posed

producers (service sector), with an emphasis on encouraging separate collection, by means of customised collection  
arranged with those major waste generators.
The establishments may sign up to the new system on a voluntary basis, and will need to store the waste generated separately 
in containers or bags, in an allocated protected space within their business premises. Once the recipient is full and as required  
by the establishment, the latter will contact the management company for its on-demand collection.
The aim is thus to facilitate user-friendly separate collection for the major generators.  This is expected to lead to 
better use of the waste generated by those stakeholders: such as the food thrown away by restaurants, hotels, bars,
schools, markets, shops, public buildings, etc., along with the waste paper and cardboard, glass, light packaging and oil.

different landfills in Gipuzkoa: Beasain, Azpeitia and Zarautz. This reflects the problem regarding waste in the zone, which 
requires a change in management to bring the amount of waste generated down and increase the separate collection.

the waste measures being implemented in the municipalities of Gipuzkoa.
In this context, Renteria wishes to build on the efforts that other municipalities are making in this regard and it will therefore study  
the possible introduction of the fifth container. This deployment will be carried out progressively, in tandem with

In the beginning of the project a strategy was formulated to reduce energy use in municipally owned buildings and the city’s transports (se uploaded file). The targets and the strategy have been adopted by the City Council. The Environment Administration is responsible for the project together with two working groups (one for buildings and one for transport) consisting of representatives from the involved parties.
The national funding to municipalities for energy efficiency work ended in 2015, but the City of Gothenburg has chosen to continue to follow up the targets and keep the networks. Nowadays the follow-up also relates to the energy target in the Climate Programme (see other action), which means a 10 percent reduction in energy consumption by 2030 covering all energy use within the city limits. For municipal buildings the ambitions is higher, as shown in the Annex to the Climate Programme. For both commercial and residential properties owned by the city the target means an energy reduction of approximately 30 percent.
Targets in the Energy Efficiency Strategy:
• By 2014 energy use (kWh/square meter) in commercial and residential premises owned by the city will have been reduced by 7 % compared to 2009.
• By 2020 energy use (kWh/square meter) in commercial and residential premises owned by the city will have been reduced by 15 % compared to 2009.
• By 2014 the use of energy in the city’s own transports has been reduced by 3 % compared to 2009.
• By 2020 the use of energy in the city’s own transports has been reduced by 7 % compared to 2009.",Energy Effiency Strategy - City of Gothenburg,2010,Completed,Policy/Strategies/Action Plans

3885,"City of Gothenburg, Sweden",Sweden,"The current parking policy was approved in 2009. The parking policy aims to reduce commuting by car to and from Gothenburg, reduce the number of cars in street areas and encourage cycling and car sharing by prioritizing their parking needs. Positive effects expected are reduced car use, increased availability for commercial traffic and visitors, and a more attractive urban environment. Compared with previous parking policies, the current one is meant to be used as a tool for sustainable urban development.
The parking policy aims to retain the same number of car spaces for the city centre, whilst reducing space-demanding surface. This will create more space for public transport and cycling and allow squares, streets and quays to be converted into attractive thoroughfares and meeting places. The costs for street parking will increase, so that fewer will park in the streets and more in parking buildings. More parking places are also arranged close to bus stops and train stations in the suburban areas, to make it easier for car travelers to commute by public transport to the city centre.
As a complement to the policy parking provision is used in spatial planning. The effects differ by how you regulate parking for residents, visitors and workplaces. On the one hand parking provision aims to ensure that residents can have access to 24-hour spaces which eliminates the need to move the car and thus reduces unnecessary car use. On the other hand the number of parking spaces for residents is lower in areas with good public transport. The number of car parks at workplaces will be reduced substantially if they are easy to reach by public transport. 
The City Council has made an assignment that the current guidelines concerning parking space in new buildings should be updated to reflect the new Transport Strategy (see other action) in a better way. This is because a lower proportion of parking lots are needed in certain urban exploitation areas as a result of increased possibilities to travel by public transport and bike, and also as a measurement to reduce the demand of car travels in urban areas of Gothenburg.",Parking Policy for Gothenburg - City of Gothenburg,2009,Completed,Policy/Strategies/Action Plans

The objective with the energy renovation at Katjas Gata 119 was to reduce the energy use from 178 kWh/m² (Atemp) to approximately 60 kWh/m² and to give us knowledge about technical and economical problems and solutions and experiences from the tenants point of view. 
After the renovation the building energy consumption is between 50-60 kWh/m² (Atemp) which meets the objectives. The energy renovation resulted in better indoor climate compare to a normal renovation and the tenants are satisfied with their living. The project didn’t meet the city’s demand on return of investment. To get a cost-effective project the building must be in need of renovation and preferably create more lettable area while renovating.
With these conclusions the owner, Bostads AB Poseidon, developed the concept for the five remaining similar buildings. By adding two extra floors with 12 new apartments that split the joint costs of installations, the rebuilding the roof and ground etcetera, also the economical objective was reached.

• In 2050 Gothenburg has a sustainable and fair level of carbon dioxide emissions (one of the reported Commitments)
The objective is a long-term visionary target that is the foundation of the energy and climate related strategies and programs in Gothenburg. The climate objective for 2050 was approved by the city council in 2008. In absolute figures the goal is to reduce our consumption-based emissions per capita from 8 tons to 2 tons, following the IPCC recommendations.
The visionary objective has four intermediate objectives: 
1.	By 2020 the emissions of carbon dioxide from the non-ETS sector in Gothenburg have been reduced by at least 40 % compared to 1990 (one of the reported Commitments).
2.	By 2020 the use of energy in housing should have been reduced by at least 30 % and the use of electricity (excluding industries and transports) should decrease by at least 20 % compared to 1995.
3.	In 2035 the emissions of greenhouse gases from the geographical area of Gothenburg will not exceed 2 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per capita.
4.	By 2035 the consumption based emissions of greenhouse gases will not exceed 3.5 tons per capita in Gothenburg.

The transport sector has increased climate emissions for a long time. But there are examples which indicate that it is possible to break the trend – rail shuttles to and from the port is one such.
The Port of Gothenburg is investing heavily in increasing the proportion of goods carried by train. In 2000, a total of 22 percent of all containers were transported to and from the port by train. In 2013, the proportion was 48 percent. This positive development is due to a system of rail shuttles that the Port of Gothenburg has built up together with railway operators and others.
At present, there are some 25 daily rail shuttles between the Port of Gothenburg and towns and cities throughout Sweden and Norway. The development of the rail shuttles is a very focused initiative taken by the Port of Gothenburg and got underway properly in 2002.
The rail shuttles result in reduced environmental impact. Some 61,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide were saved during 2012 by moving the goods to and from the Port of Gothenburg by rail instead of by road.

The municipality measures the noise twice a year to follow up how well the asphalt is working. Measurements from summer 2015 showed very good results, the asphalt reduced noise by 10-12 dB, which is basically as good as when it was new. 
In addition, the speed has been reduced to 100 km/h. This lowers the noise by 1 dB, and reduces particle emissions.

The project was initiated in 2010, when Uppsala municipality invited local actors from both the public and private sector to sign a ""local Kyoto protocol"". In the first programme period (2010-2012) 17 organizations signed the protocol, in the second programme period (2012-2015) there were 29 participants, from a wide number of sectors. Today the protocol is an established and effective arena for climate action and cooperation in Uppsala, and the main area for developing ideas how to reach the city's long term energy and climate goals. Each member sets energy and climate goals (in sectors buildings, transports, production and other) to reach a common goal for the programme period. During the first period (2010-2012), the common goal was to decrease the members’ greenhouse gas emissions by 3.7 %. The outcome was a decrease of about 4 percent, while total turnover increased. During the subsequent programme period (2012-2015), the goal was  to reduce our collective emissions by about 4.5 %. The result was a decrease of fully 11 percent. For the third period, 2015-2018, the goal is to reduce emissions in total by 4,7 %, and in transport sector 8,8 %. The organization of the protocol consists of process management, coordination group, climate group (all members) and round table meetings (desicion making bodies). The practical work is concretized and realized in working groups, so called focus groups, out of the common themes of the period. Members and also non-members are welcome to participate in the focus groups. One of four themes for 2015-2018 is Transport, and there are two focus groups of the theme: Sustainable travel and Sustainable freight transport. Some examples of ongoing and completed projects formed in the groups are: - Investigation of travel habits/action for sustainable travel. - Bicycle-friendly workplace - diplomas. - ""Winter biking"" - encouraging commuting by bike all year around. - Preliminary study of coordinated goods transport in the city. - Regional seminar on fossil free heavy transport.

Instead of building permanent garages or car parks in or in connection to new buildings, according to the current parking standard, developers pay a fee to the municipality, who build common parking facilities, in which residents can rent parking lots. There are several postive outcomes: The developers can focus on the residential part of the development, not parking. The system is also more fair, since the cost for car parks doesn't affect all residents (as is common today), just the ones owning a car. The most important outcome is the possibility to plan residential areas with minimized car use. Common car parks managed by the municipality are also more flexible when mobility in the city changes, and doesn't ""freeze"" infrastructure around cars. One example of the method is the parking garage Dansmästaren, in development area Rosendal. The parking garage will contain regular car parks, charching stations for electrical vehicles, bike parking and car pool. This action does not contain an estimated reduction in green house gases.

5043,"City of Chicago, IL, United States",United States,"Chicago City Council approved an ordinance, introduced by Mayor Rahm Emanuel, that will require the city’s largest buildings to benchmark their energy use and authorize the City to disclose the energy efficiency for these buildings publicly. Under the new regulation, the approximately 3,500 commercial, residential, and municipal buildings over 50,000 square feet will be required to track and verify energy consumption using Portfolio Manager, a free web-based tool administered by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Covered buildings will report energy use data annually to the City through an automated process and be required to have their data verified by a licensed architect, engineer or other professional recognized by the City every three years. The City will publish an annual report on energy efficiency. The ordinance will also allow the City to publicly disclose individual building energy performance, starting in June 2015.
Benchmarking and disclosure will accelerate Chicago’s energy efficiency market. A recent study by the US Environmental Protection Agency cited average energy savings of 7% for buildings that used Portfolio Manager from 2008-2011. If the buildings covered by this ordinance make energy efficiency improvements that result in just 5% of energy savings, this will result in a $250 million

Through this plan, trails and bike lanes/routes are funded by private development as well as federal and local funds (current trails network would require an additional $39 million to complete 49 miles at $800,000/mile). The idea behind the alternative mode plan is to provide non-motorized transportation to city residents. A study done by the RTC estimated that less than 1 percent of annual transportation trips were made by bicycle. If applied to an average 20 mile round trip commute, the average cost savings would be $3.42/day per bicycle commute (gasoline estimated at $3.10/gal).

However, AVR actually decreased from 1.67 to 1.64 over three years. One of the factors influencing this decrease was the relocation of several large technology employers out of Santa Monica.
In 2015, the Transportation Demand Management Ordinance was expanded to capture businesses with 30 employees or more, which resulted in 166 additional employers now implementing trip reduction measures for 6,000 employees. The update also designated varying AVR targets of 2.2, 2.0, 1.75, and 1.60 based on proximity to transit,  such as the Expo Light Rail.

5377,"City of Santa Monica, CA, United States",United States,"Under the directive to achieve 100% water selfsufficiency from imported water, as well as meet State conservation targets, the City adopted its Sustainable Water Master Plan (SWMP), updated the Water Shortage Response Plan and added a Water Conservation Unit. 
An educational and marketing campaign was launched to encourage conservation. Residents and businesses were provided water-use consultations for indoor and outdoor solutions. The City also began to strictly enforce existing conservation ordinances and implemented water-use allowances, which provides a water budget to each customer. 
Through these efforts, Santa Monica achieved the State mandated 20% reduction in water use (compared to 2013). From 2012 to 2015, water consumption decreased by approximately 2.8 million gallons per day (MGD), or by more than 20 gallons of water per person per day, well exceeding the goals outlined in the 15x15 CAP. Accordingly, thanks to conservation, the City annually saved 8,140,320 kWh and 2401 MTCO2e embedded in water transport, treatment, and consumption. In coordination with the directive to reach water selfsufficiency, 13% of Santa Monica’s total used water shifted from imported to locally produced from 2013 to 2015.
Local groundwater remains the largest single source of water supply for the City. To further develop local sources of water this year, the City is currently in the process of piloting a new water treatment plant and designing a wastewater treatment plant, the latter of which would create additional non-potable supply from wastewater through the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Project (SWIP), which is largely funded by State grants. Producing water locally is less energy intensive than importing it from Northern California and the Colorado River. Thanks to the increase of more locally produced water, the City helps avoid 126 MTCO2e that would have otherwise been used on imported water.
To mitigate any increase in new water demand, the City has plans to implement a water neutrality program which will establish water budgets for new development. Exceeding that budget will require the developer to fund community water conservation projects to offset the additional water demand.","Reduce water demand by 200,000 gallons per day - City of Santa Monica, CA",,In operation,Policy/Strategies/Action Plans

Approximately 2% of all vehicles registered in Santa Monica are electric or hybrid.

The 15x15 CAP called for a network of 200 public chargers by the end of 2015. To date, Santa Monica currently has 69 publicly available chargers located primarily in the western part of the city, with 18 more to be installed at mid-city and Main Street lots and downtown structures along Wilshire Blvd. by summer 2016. 
The 15x15 CAP also set a target for the installation of 500 private EV chargers, yet only 142 have been installed to date. As most residents live in apartments and condos, which pose multiple challenges to private EV charging, the City and Southern California Edison (SCE) are now focused on increasing charger integration at public locations and multifamily properties. In 2016, Southern California Edison (SCE) launched its Charge Ready pilot program for electric vehicle charging stations. Charge Ready will install and operate the electrical infrastructure required to charge EVs at workplaces, multifamily properties and destinations.

In 2014, Santa Monica was the first city to partner with the Meatless Monday campaign meant to challenge residents to completely eliminate meat from their diets at least once a week. Local restaurants have also taken the challenge to offer Meatless Monday specials on their menus.
The City also created “Sustainable Healthy Food Purchasing Guidelines” to encourage City-hosted events to adhere to its five-principle “Sustainable Food Commitments” by involving more sustainable food.
From 2014 to 2015, staff involvement in “Meatless in March” resulted in saving 6,059 lb. of carbon dioxide, 3,019,150 gallons of water, and 761 animals. The campaign was promoted online, and elicited 227  City employee pledges. With the Center for Food Safety, the City established a baseline of municipal purchases of meals with meat and dairy products. The information collected for 2014 revealed that 18% of meals purchased with public funds were meatless, well beyond the 2015 goal of 15% set in the Sustainable City Plan. Staff now aim to reduce meat purchases by another 15% by 2020.

By early 2013, the City was already achieving a 77% waste-from-landfill diversion rate, higher than the State’s mandatory 65% diversion rate. 
To demonstrate leadership, a zero waste program was implemented at City Hall and the library branches. Individual desk-side trash containers were replaced with recycling and composting containers and centralized zero-waste sorting stations.To meet State requirements by 2016, the City worked with businesses and large multi-family residential buildings to provide organic recycling programs. 
City staff partnered with Santa Monica College to cocreate an immersive academic curriculum on food waste and waste management.

5381,"City of Santa Monica, CA, United States",United States,"Santa Monica also established a 30% emissions reduction goal for municipal operations by 2015. Emissions from municipal operations are a small portion of the overall community emissions. Overall emissions have decreased 44% compared to 1990 after a sharp increase in 2007.
The City continues to procure Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) for 100% of its eligible electricity accounts. Staff track municipal emissions in two scenarios: one accounting for RECs and one not accounting. This allows for staff to better understand both the value of energy efficiency and onsite renewable energy and purchasing RECs. When accounting for RECs, the City achieved a 42% reduction below 1990 levels for municipal greenhouse gas emissions.
Approximately 30-35% of Santa Monica’s water is imported from Northern California and the Colorado River. In 2011, the City set a goal to become water selfsufficient by 2020 and has since increased production of water from local groundwater wells.
Pumping and treating water uses a lot of energy and, as the City has increased production, energy use has risen as well. Currently, pumping and treating water accounts for almost 38% of the City’s electricity consumption.
Increasing energy efficiency in operations and siting renewable energy generation for the City’s water system will be increasingly important as Santa Monica reaches water self-sufficiency.
The City routinely identifies and implements energy efficiency projects to lower utility bills and maintenance hours.
Energy efficiency projects under the 15x15 CAP have reduced annual energy use by 1,398,896 kWh in electricity and 36,641 therms of natural gas.  
The City’s newest facilities were designed and built to the highest sustainability standards. Parking Structure 6 and Pico Branch Library both achieved LEED Platinum and feature solar energy systems.
The City’s newest endeavor, the City Services Building, seeks to achieve the most advanced level of sustainability by generating its own energy needs and water needs onsite as a “Living Building”.
One of the biggest sources of emissions in City operations is Big Blue Bus (BBB). While Big Blue Bus has helped keep hundreds of thousands of vehicles off the road, increasing services has also meant increasing emissions, until recently. In 2015, Big Blue Bus announced that it is now fueling its fleet with renewable natural gas - becoming one of first municipal transit authorities in the country to do so - sourced from non-fracked methane gas captured from the decompostion of landfill waste. This bold achievement reduced the BBB fleet’s carbon footprint by more than 60%.","Reduce municipal greenhouse gas emissions - City of Santa Monica, CA",,Completed,Technical/Infrastructure investment
5382,"City of Santa Monica, CA, United States",United States,"In 2015, Santa Monica became the first city in Southern California to launch a bike-sharing program. The Breeze Bike Share debuted 500 eight-speed bicycles at 75 stations throughout Santa Monica and Venice. Riders use a mobile app to reserve and unlock the bicycles for short trips. After 100 days of operation, 8,529 users logged a collective 86,180 miles traveled and 81,371 lbs. of carbon dioxide emissions avoided.
Bicyclists are also now enjoying 107 miles of new bike lanes, “sharrow” lanes, and other routes that have been added since the 2011 adoption of the Bike Action Plan (BAP): 90 miles of new bike lanes and 17 miles of shared-lane markings. While exceeding the 15x15 CAP’s goal of a 69mile addition to the City’s bike path network, the BAP remains 57% complete*. The City is working toward 100% completion of the plan by 2020, which includes further expansion of bike paths, upgrades of existing roads, striping bikeways with high visibility treatments, addressing bike crashes, and other services. To improve the safety and experience of walking, the City developed a Pedestrian Action Plan (PAP) to provide a comprehensive document to guide policy for improved pedestrian safety and useable infrastructure. It includes the City’s first statement regarding “Vision Zero:” a plan to eliminate roadway injuries and fatalities. 
The PAP calls for short-term projects like diagonal crossing or ‘scramble’ intersections in the downtown area, new curb ramps, signal timing changes, and pavement markings, and longer-term initiatives, such as greenways, lighting, and reconfigured intersections that will prioritize pedestrian access. Increasing walking will continue to reduce vehicle emissions and congestion, while improving personal wellbeing and health.","Increase biking and walking mode share to 15 percent - City of Santa Monica, CA",,Completed,Policy/Strategies/Action Plans
